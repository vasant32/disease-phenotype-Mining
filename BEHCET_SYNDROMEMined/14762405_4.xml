<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the optic disc topography of patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) with age-matched controls, using Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 32 patients (51 eyes) with ocular BD (active and/or inactive), 38 patients (74 eyes) with nonocular BD, and 62 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (62 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and control group underwent complete ophthalmologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure was less than 22 mmHg in patients and in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optic nerve heads of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were imaged with the HRT (software 2.01a-M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following stereometric parameters were calculated for each patient: disc area, cup area, cup/disc area ratio, rim area, height variation contour, cup volume, rim volume, mean cup depth, cup shape measure, mean RNFL thickness, and RNFL cross-sectional area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences among the groups were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference between groups, multiple comparison tests were used to find out which groups differed from which others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean disc area was significantly smaller (P&lt;0.05) in patients with ocular and nonocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean cup area, mean cup depth, and mean cup volume were significantly smaller (P&lt;0.05) in patients with ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the groups in terms of the other stereometric parameters (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A small disc and cup may be an additional risk factor for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vaso-occlusion in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
