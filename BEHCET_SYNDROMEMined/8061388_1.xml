<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined 21 cases of Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome in detail, and present here their clinicoradiological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, signs of pyramidal tract and meningeal irritation were frequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports, our study demonstrated a near equal frequency in the occurrence of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> and that of focal brain stem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Notably, our results showed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of both the cerebrum and the brain stem was often observed, indicating the presence of continuous disease activity in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the high frequency of meningeal irritation signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our cases exhibited pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicated the possibility that chemical mediators secreted from infiltrating cells in the CSF may somehow inflict damage to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> in Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
