<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the outcome of endovascular treatments for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> in different vascular beds secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few case reports on the subject, and this is the largest study to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2001 through October 2009, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> venous occlusions were treated in 10 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male [age range 18-76 years]) with BD using percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were symptomatic and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> iliofemoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT; n = 5), central venous occlusion (n = 3), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS; n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met criteria of the International Study Group on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of five patients with DVT had unsuccessful recanalization attempts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had successful recanalization with stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three veins were occluded within 1 month with unsuccessful reinterventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> central venous occlusion had successful recanalization with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (n = 1) and stent placement (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had reocclusion with successful reintervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two BCS patients had successful treatment with stent placements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall technical success was 69%, and no procedural complications were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> DVT had patent veins; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with central venous occlusion or BCS had patent veins on color Doppler ultrasonography at follow-up ranging from 3 to 48 months after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovenous treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> iliofemoral DVT due to BD had a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, long-term outcome after endovenous treatment for upper-extremity central venous occlusion and BCS syndrome was good </plain></SENT>
