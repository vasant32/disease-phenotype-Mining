<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 19 patients with severe ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease treated with combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> alone failed to control the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> therapy alone (mean dosage, 8.6 mg/kg of body weight per day), and nine patients were given lower dosages of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (mean dosage, 6.2 mg/kg of body weight per day) in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (mean dosage, 29.4 mg per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up on therapy was 51 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After three months of therapy, a trend toward greater improvement in visual acuity was noted in patients treated with combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> compared to those receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone (17.8 letters vs 10.2 letters, P = .2379), but after one year little difference was observed in the improvement between the two groups (5.8 letters vs 3.3 letters, P = .7984) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a trend toward greater renal toxicity was seen in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone after both three months and one year of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of either a suboptimal therapeutic response or adverse effects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone at baseline had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> added to their regimen after a mean time of 23.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, visual acuity remained stable or improved in 28 of 37 eyes (75.7%) over the course of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy is an effective treatment for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and may be less toxic than therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A prospective, randomized trial with a larger sample size is needed to provide definitive data </plain></SENT>
