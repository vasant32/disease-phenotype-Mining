<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The VOR gains in the darkness were elevated in 63% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The elevated gain in the darkness was not attributed with certainty to vestibular adaptation to defective smooth pursuit, because only 25% of the patients manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0007772'>impaired smooth pursuit</z:hpo> eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>Visual impairment</z:hpo> occurred in some patients but did not correlate with the VOR elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unknown mechanism affecting the vestibular system has been considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The VOR elevation in the darkness may suggest the presence of a latent brainstem abnormality in the patients </plain></SENT>
