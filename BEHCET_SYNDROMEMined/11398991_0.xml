<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with ocular involvement and 15 patients without ocular involvement were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Candidacidal assay was performed to assess the in vitro killing of Candida species by the polymorphonuclear neutrophils of both the study and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In brief, peripheral venous polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers and patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were obtained by density gradient centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells were incubated with Candida spp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata) for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples were seeded onto yeast extract peptone <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> agar, incubated at 25 degrees C in a 5% humidified incubator for another 48 h, and formed colonies were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the candidacidal activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils of healthy volunteers and of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with or without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> are reported in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, in vitro killing of Candida spp., which is one of the parameters for the phagocytic function of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, was not affected </plain></SENT>
