<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional laboratory and clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective study of blood samples of 24 patients diagnosed with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, which were analyzed for factor VIII, factor XI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen and ristocetin (vWF ag and risto), antithrombin III (ATIII), protein C and S, fibrinogen and activated protein C (APC) resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with 40 healthy controls and analyzed for association with ocular and systemic clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean values of factor VIII, factor XI, vWF ag, vWF risto, ATIII, and fibrinogen were significantly raised compared to healthy population (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>: P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most striking were factor VIII activity levels above 130% in 79% (19 of 24) of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>67% (16 of 24) had levels of factor VIII above 150%, which correlates with a fivefold increase in risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other prothrombogenic factors were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 patients (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, 1 factor V Leiden mutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cell activation, measured by vWF activity, revealed elevated levels in 42% (10/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete/incomplete <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with present or previous macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> had significantly higher FVIII levels than complete/incomplete <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients who had never shown any signs of macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (P =.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further correlations between the laboratory results and clinical symptoms were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found a generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> with endothelial cell activation in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, irrespectively of current ocular disease activity </plain></SENT>
