<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a multisystemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease usually occurs between the second and the fourth decades, whereas it is uncommon in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this multicenter study, we aimed to describe the demographic and clinical features along with severity in juvenile- versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with initial symptoms at age 16 years or younger were considered as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 83 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> BD (38 male and 45 female; mean age 19.6 +/- 7.6 years) and 536 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> (&gt;16 years) BD (293 male and 243 female; mean age 39.2 +/- 10.1 years) who fulfilled the classification criteria of the International Study Group for BD were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Familial cases were more frequent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD (19% vs 10.3%; P = .017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 12.29 +/- 3.54 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> BD and 31.66 +/- 8.71 years in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mucocutaneous lesions and articular symptoms were the most commonly observed manifestations in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of disease manifestations was not different between juvenile- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD, except neurologic and gastrointestinal involvement, which were higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> BD than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD (P = .027 and P = .024, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcer</z:hpo> was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> manifestation of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> (86.74%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> (89.55%) BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> manifestations of BD were similar, except genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, which was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD (P = .025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Our study consisted of patients with BD mainly applying to dermatology and venerology departments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it can be speculated that this study includes rather a milder spectrum of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> BD seems to be similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> BD, the frequency of severe organ involvement was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because of the higher prevalence of familial cases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile-onset</z:hpo> BD, it can be speculated that genetic factors may favor early expression of the disease with severe organ involvement </plain></SENT>
