<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association of the endothelial NO Synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphisms with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was carried out using 193 unrelated Turkish BD patients and 106 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were genotyped by PCR for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): -786 T--&gt;C in the promoter region and 894 G--&gt;T in exon 7 (Glu298Asp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 4 was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The VNTR polymorphism was associated with BD, detected by an increased frequency of the b allele (odds ratio = 1.9, P = 0.0069) and b/b genotype (odds ratio = 2.2, P = 0.002) in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the stratification of cases according to the family history, a significant difference between familial cases and controls in the -786 SNP was observed, with an increase in the frequency of the T allele (odds ratio = 2.5, P = 0.0016) and T/T genotype (odds ratio = 2.5, P = 0.0085), and the association of the VNTR polymorphism with BD became stronger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The -786*T and VNTR*b alleles were in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.65, P &lt;0.0001), and the number of individuals homozygous for the -786*T/VNTR*b haplotype was significantly increased in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: eNOS gene polymorphisms are associated with BD, which might contribute to the reduced NO activity observed in BD patients </plain></SENT>
