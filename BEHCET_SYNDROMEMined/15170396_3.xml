<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The common inherited gene defects, factor V (FV) 1691A (Leiden) and prothrombin (PT) 20210A, are known risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FV 4070G polymorphism was shown to influence circulating FV levels and to contribute to the activated protein C resistance phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of FV 1691A, FV 4070G and PT 20210A gene mutations in Turkish BD patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one patients with BD (27 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>) and 91 healthy subjects were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FV 1691A, FV 4070G, and PT 20210A mutations were determined by a method based on PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of FV 1691A heterozygous mutation in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (25.9%) was significantly higher than that in healthy subjects (8.8%; OR = 3.63; 95% CI 1.18-11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the frequency of this mutation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was higher than that in the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (11.4%), the difference did not reach a statistically significant level (OR = 2.73; 95% CI 0.77-9.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BD patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the frequencies of FV 4070G and PT 20210A were not significantly different compared to the BD patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the FV 1691A, FV 4070G, and PT 20210A mutations are unlikely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
