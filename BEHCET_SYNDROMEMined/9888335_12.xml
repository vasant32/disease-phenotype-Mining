<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) demonstrate hyperreactivity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>), and the induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> may serve as a model for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the sequence of histopathologic changes after needle prick trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients fulfilling the International Study Group Criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease, two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo>, and two healthy controls each underwent intradermal injections with subsequent biopsies at 0, 4, 24, and 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin sections were evaluated in a blinded fashion according to 11 histopathologic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At time zero, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By 4 h, neutrophils were present usually admixed with lymphocytes (8 out of 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory cell density peaked by 24 h in 8 out of 10 patients and at 48 h in 2 out of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sparse leukocytoclasis was identifiable from 4 to 48 h, but was not associated with fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>True <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (as evidenced by fibrin within vessel walls and/or intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>) was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraepidermal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustules</z:mpath> (IEPs) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) aggregates within the needle tract were seen as early as 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The control patients and three out of eight of the BD patients failed to develop clinical lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among this group histopathologic IEPs were lacking in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> is mediated by PMNs and lymphocytes without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hyperchemotaxis may explain the rapid accumulation of PMNs along the injection site </plain></SENT>
