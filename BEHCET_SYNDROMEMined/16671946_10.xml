<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from 180 Japanese BD patients and 170 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequency of HLA-B*5101 was significantly increased in the patients (61.7%) as compared with the controls (15.9%) (Pc = 1 x 10(-16), OR = 8.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When we recalculated the phenotype frequencies after excluding the HLA-B*51-positive patients and controls to account for the effects of the linkage disequilibrium and the abundance of the HLA-B*51 allele, the frequencies of HLA-A*2602 and HLA-B*3901 had a weak association in the patient group without HLA-B*51 as compared with the control group without HLA-B*51 (A*2602; Pc = 0.130, OR = 4.3, B*3901; Pc = 0.099, OR = 3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study confirmed on the basis of using a new and more accurate genotyping method that Japanese BD patients have a strong primary association with HLA-B*5101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant increase of HLA-A*2602 and B*3901 in the patient group without HLA-B*51 suggests that these two alleles might also have some secondary influence on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
