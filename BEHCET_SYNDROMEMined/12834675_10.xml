<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of women with noninfectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and pregnancy during follow-up at a large eye hospital were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with pregnancy were included in the study if follow-up was adequate to document the presence or absence of flare-ups in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> activity during the pregnancy and/or postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six pregnancies among 50 women were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three pregnancies were in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease</z:e>, 19 were in women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, and 24 were in women with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A flare-up in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> activity occurred within the first 4 months of pregnancy in 49 of 76 cases (64%) and later in pregnancy in 17 cases (22%); no flare-up occurred during pregnancy in 21 cases (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An early pregnancy flare-up was typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease</z:e> and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A flare-up within 6 months of delivery occurred in 38 of 59 cases (64%) that had adequate examination data available from the postpartum period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postpartum flare-up was especially typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Many women with noninfectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> will experience a flare-up in disease activity within the first 4 months of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Later pregnancy appears to be a time of relative disease inactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many will experience a rebound in activity within 6 months of delivery </plain></SENT>
