<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to those of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), using the same questionnaires, and analyzed in relation to the mean temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the patient's location, obtained from the official Israeli Meteorological Service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that SLE patients had a tendency towards winter worsening of clinical manifestations, shown as increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pains</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, as well as increased number of hospital admissions, sick leaves, and need to raise the dose of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of patients with BD were not correlated to seasons of the year, except for increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pains</z:hpo> in autumn and spring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that UVR accumulation might cause exacerbations in SLE patients several months after prolonged exposure to sunlight in the summer </plain></SENT>
