<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic tendency is another characteristics of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While hemorheological changes play crucial role in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, erythrocyte deformability (ED), which is one of the main determinants of microcirculation and blood viscosity, has not been studied before in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ED was measured by the filtration method in 13 active BD patients diagnosed according to the criteria proposed by International Study Group for BD (ISG-BD) and in 13 age-, sex-, weight-, smoking habit-, and blood pressure-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ED was decreased in active BD patients compared to the healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median deformability indices (DIs) in BD patients and healthy controls were 3.19 and 2.08 (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ED may be one of the reasons for increased thrombotic tendency in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alteration in ED possibly plays a crucial role in the etiopathogenesis of thrombotic complications in BD and thus may be a target for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drugs increasing ED, such as pentoxifylline, have already been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that the therapeutic mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of this drug in BD is likely to be the correction of impaired ED </plain></SENT>
