<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover trial, 169 patients without major organ involvement were selected consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They fulfilled the International Criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 4 months, they were swapped over (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> to placebo, placebo to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>) for another 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the overall disease activity index, the IBDDAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome was the responses of the individual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Student's paired t test was used to evaluate results within each group, and an ANOVA to check for differences between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed using the "intention to treat" method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For placebo, IBDDAM worsened from 3.17 to 3.63 (t = 1.750, P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, IBDDAM improved from 3.35 to 2.75 (t = 4.143, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e>, genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406191" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudofolliculitis</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum improved significantly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> but not with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to the ANOVA, the difference in IBDDAM between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and placebo was highly significant (F = 14.674, P = 0.00016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference between the results for males and females was not significant (F = 0.181, P = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, but not placebo, significantly improved the overall disease activity index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The difference between the results for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and placebo was also statistically significant </plain></SENT>
