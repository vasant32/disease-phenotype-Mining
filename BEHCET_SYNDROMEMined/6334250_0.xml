<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the light of current knowledge, the most likely hypothesis seems to be that of an autoimmune reaction set off by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> or other antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reaction may manifest itself in the vascular system, and cause vasculitic conditions in genetically susceptible subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The existence of a constitutional susceptibility factor would seem to be confirmed by the high and significant incidence of determinant histocompatibility antigens: HLA-B5 in Japan and in Mediterranean countries, HLA-A2 and HLA-A28 in Great Britain and the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi> are most commonly used to treat the disease; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> are also recommended--possibly in association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three personally observed cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first was an example of the disease in its complete form (oral and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e>, ocular lesions); the second case incomplete (no genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e>); and the third characterised by severe neurological involvement (neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
