<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Soluble antigen (S-Ag) is a member of the arrestin family of protein with which it shares a high level of homology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is an immunologically privileged <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> antigen that can elicit experimental autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (EAU) and is thought to be a target for ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to identify in humans, the immunogenic determinants of human S-Ag and to establish whether a specific response profile occurs in particular ocular inflammatory conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocyte responses were measured against a panel of 40 overlapping synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of human S-Ag in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sympathetic ophthalmia</z:e> were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A limited number of immunodominant determinants were identified for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located at sites of limited homology with other known arrestins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, several individual patients had prominent proliferative responses to multiple determinants well above that of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This determinant spread was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disease entities except <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sympathetic ophthalmia</z:e>, which did not show any immunoreactivity to S-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant response shifts were also noted over time in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there are specific immunodominant determinants to human S-Ag in patients with certain forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in individual patients, response is not limited to these determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of disease, response is spread over many determinants </plain></SENT>
