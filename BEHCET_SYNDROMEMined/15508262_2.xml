<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, we investigated the utility of Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT and MRI in patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>,cet's disease (n-BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients (two females, ten males; mean age 33 +/- 9.6 yr; age range 18-45 yr) with n-BD, fulfilling the criteria of the International Study Group for BD, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed according to a standard protocol with 1 or 1.5 T imagers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT data were obtained using a single head gamma camera after 555 MBq Tc-99m HMPAO injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following image reconstruction, regional cerebral perfusion was evaluated both visually and semi quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurological examination showed parenchymal brain involvement in 6 of 12 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 patients had white matter lesions on MRI, while only 5 of them showed perfusion defects on brain SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 6 patients (50%) without clinical signs of parenchymal brain involvement, 1 patient showed a pathological brain SPECT and 3 patients showed pathological MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative analysis of brain regions on SPECT study showed statistically significant hypoperfusion of biparietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study investigates the correlation between clinical, MRI and SPECT findings and it shows discrepancy between these findings in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brain SPECT may act as a complementary modality to increase the detection rate of affected regions in patients with n-BD </plain></SENT>
