<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T mutation is a known risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the MTHFR gene C677 mutation in patients with BD and evaluate if there was an association with clinical features, especially <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, in a relatively large cohort of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 318 patients with BD and 207 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated and genotyped using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay for the MTHFR gene C677T mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of the C677T mutation showed a statistically significant difference between BD patients and controls (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant association between C677T alteration and response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in BD patients (p=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that there was a high association between the MTHFR gene C677T mutation and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis according to clinical features for this disease did not reveal an association except response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> that was shown to be influenced by the MTHFR C677T mutation </plain></SENT>
