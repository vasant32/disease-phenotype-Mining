<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course and therapeutic outcome were compared to the patients' visual acuity and the duration of the disease prior to institution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up was 4.6 years, maximum 9 years </plain></SENT>
