<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who relapsed despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha2a was administered subcutaneously (three million units thrice a week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic examination and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography associated with laboratory tests were performed at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were visual acuity and recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks before, during, and after initiation of IFN-alpha2a therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was achieved in 28 of 32 patients (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean observation period of the 28 responder patients was 70.6 months (range, 30.3 to 129.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median visual acuity improved from 0.52 to 0.33 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units; P = .005) two years after initiation of IFN-alpha2a therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate decreased significantly during IFN-alpha2a treatment from 1.68 +/- 1.22 relapses/patient/year to 0.11 +/- 0.20 relapses/patient/year (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha2a was discontinued in 19 of 28 patients (68%) after 32 months of treatment (range, 16 to 50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up after IFN-alpha2a discontinuation was 43 months (range, 11 to 84 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After IFN-alpha2a discontinuation, the relapse rate increased from 0.08 +/- 0.21 relapse/person/year to 0.74 +/- 1.40 relapse/person/year (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha2a is efficient and safe for the long-term management of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile it seems to be a suspensive therapeutic strategy, even though long-term remission is possible in some patients </plain></SENT>
