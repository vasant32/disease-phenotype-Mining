<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serologic/genomic findings have suggested microbes as possible causative agents and the geographical distribution suggests environmental influences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed comparative analyses of 40 patients with BD or related symptoms not fulfilling BD criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients originating from different regions of Iran were tested by molecular/serological methods for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> viruses and parvovirus B19, two Chlamydiae species, as well as Coxiella, Listeria, Yersinia, Leptospira and Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paratuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen-typing was performed: testing of cytokine profiles and immune mediators representative for the cellular immune system, including neopterin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No apparent differences in interleukin (IL)-4, 6, 8 and 10 were observed, whereas production of soluble IL-2-receptor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha were more pronounced in the BD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neopterin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28683">kynurenine</z:chebi> production was comparable, although both groups showed twice the levels of healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant differences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) antibody titres were observed but higher titres against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were found in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 20 BD patients and controls neither parvovirus B19 DNA was detected nor <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>Viral</z:mp> DNA of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes</z:e> virus (HHV)8 was detected more frequently in the BD group, whereas HSV DNA was only found in the controls, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> might be caused by HSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although no significant association of BD was detected with a single pathogen, our findings suggest that detection of HSV DNA or Chlamydiae would rather argue against classic BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether there is a discriminative potential of the tested immune mediators/receptors has to be elucidated in further studies </plain></SENT>
