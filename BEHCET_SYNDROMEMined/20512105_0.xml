<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim is to inform authors, investigators, and journal editors about the evolution and progression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet symptoms or findings chronologically in evidence-based historical articles since Hippocratic writings to bring physicians with different areas of interest to a consensus and thus address the significance of consistency in the eponym "<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet" among authors interested in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease care and research, as science does not accept a "naming dilemma" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: The historical progression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is divided into three periods, namely pre-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet, and post-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although similar symptoms and clinical findings were reported in Hippocratic writings, a clear description of the "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Triple Symptom Complex</z:e>" consisting of the "Classical Triad" that indicates a new syndrome, was not presented until the important publications of Dr. Hulusi <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This article will answer the needs and questions of authors and journal editors who are in a dilemma regarding the eponym </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, researchers should strongly avoid changing the name of an old disorder well known since 1941 as "<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease" by not only every physician who supervises <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients throughout the world, but also medical students and even the public </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This would otherwise lead to needless chaos among journal editors, authors, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients, who already have difficulty in defining their illness with high morbidity from blinding ocular disease or mortality from vascular, pulmonary, and neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
