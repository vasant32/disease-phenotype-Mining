<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of serum levels of IL-18 with disease activity and clinical presentations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients with BD and 20 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped as having active or inactive disease according to the Leeds activity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were also separated as a systemic involvement or mucocutaneous symptoms only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with systemic involvement were further grouped according to the presence of ocular, articular and vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-18 levels were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient subgroups as compared to healthy controls and found to be correlated with the activity score in patients having active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this cytokine participates in the pathogenesis of BD and its levels are correlated with the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection of increased levels of IL-18 in patients with inactive disease implies that Th1 activation and subclinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> persist during the inactive period of the disease </plain></SENT>
