<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of 12 recurrent BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients (16 eyes) who were followed up in Department of Ophthalmology and Department of Rheumatology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital during April 2007 to June 2008 and received etanercept for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive therapy, subcutaneous injection of 25 mg etanercept twice per week was instituted initially, followed by a tapering to once per week based on efficacy and economic consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete ocular examination including visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior segment and fundus conditions were well documented at base line and at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fundus photography, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, ocular B ultrasound were conducted when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoint of observation: substantial improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> or etanercept treatment was stopped for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 12 patients, 9 had shown improvement on visual acuity at least in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>, although 3 of them did not show improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At end point, as compared to base line, of 16 eyes, 10 (63%) had better visual acuity, 6 (37%) had the same visual acuity, and none decreased; substantial improvement or remission of both anterior and posterior segment <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No serious adverse reaction was observed during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive therapy, etanercept has good short term efficacy and safety for recurrent BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
