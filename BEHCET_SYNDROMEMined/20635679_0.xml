<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is a complex, multisystemic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was carried out on 60 patients and 24 sex- and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum osteocalcin (OK) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), which are bone formation markers and urine deoxipyridinolin (DOP) levels that is bone resorption marker were evaluated in patient and controls groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-1 and TNF-alpha levels were measured in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMD was measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the lumbar spine and left femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in OK and DOP levels between BD and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BALP levels were significantly higher in BD than control groups (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there were no statistically significant differences in IL-1 levels between BD and control groups, TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in BD than control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in BMD values of lumbar spine (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in BMD values of the left femur were detected in the groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> can be a risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> especially in the lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
