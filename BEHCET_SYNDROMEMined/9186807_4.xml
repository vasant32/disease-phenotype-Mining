<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed T lymphocyte-phenotypes infiltrated in cutaneous pustular lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and found that CD4+ T cells were predominant components although CD8+ T cells were also present in the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we established T cell lines from pustular lesions of the four patients with a streptococcal antigen, KTH-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the cell lines showed the cell surface markers of CD8+TCR alpha beta +, and expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for interleukin (IL)-8, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) alpha, and perforin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other T cell lines expressed the cell surface markers for CD4+TCR alpha beta + </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokine expression pattern of the two CD4+ T cell lines revealed that one is Th1 type and the other is Th2 type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Th2 type cell line showed marked proliferation with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that the self-reactive T cells play some role on the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
