<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical details and HLA typing of 15 Celtic Caucasian patients (four male, 11 female) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (International Study Group criteria) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The males affected were younger than the affected females, and three of these males had severe uveal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the 15 patients had the A2 Bw6 Dr4 haplotype but this did not confer family penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight had gastrointestinal involvement: two females required ileostomy, two females had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diarrhoea, one female had severe <z:mp ids='MP_0009482'>ileitis</z:mp> and oesophageal lesions, two males had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo>, and one female had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcer</z:hpo> and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002613'>biliary cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of those who developed gastrointestinal symptoms had either the Dr4 or the Dr7 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study is the largest HLA survey of Celtic Caucasians with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical features and HLA haplotypes are markedly different from 'Arab' and 'Japanese' varieties of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of the Dr4 and Dr7 antigens in those with gastrointestinal involvement possibly implicates class II antigens (Dr) in the pathogenesis of the manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the bowel </plain></SENT>
