<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (SPR) which tests this hyperreactivity in the skin is frequently used as a diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aims to investigate the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser photocoagulation (ALP)-induced cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD patients and controls and also to compare the results with the skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (SPT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 35 patients with BD and 28 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ALP was applied to the left forearms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases from 20-cm distance (2,000 mW, 100 microm) with exposure times ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 s with 0.1-s increments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, a SPT with three prics was performed to both forearms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ALP-induced cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and SPT were evaluated and scored with the same method at 48 h, and the SPR scores of 2+ and above was accepted as positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive results as defined above were found in eight cases (23%) with the ALP and in nine (26%) with the SPT in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no clear correlation between the ALP and SPT results and also between the exposure time to laser beam and SPR scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results of this study reveal that ALP can induce a skin hyperreactivity similar to the needle prick-induced SPR in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We, herein, showed that ALP can induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011123'>skin inflammation</z:hpo> with its thermal effect and without any inoculation of antigen in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This method would help to develop another experimental method to investigate the cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
