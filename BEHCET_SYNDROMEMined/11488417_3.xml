<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The phenotype and haplotype frequencies of human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DR and -DQ in 32 Chinese patients with the mucocutaneous (MC) type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) were calculated and compared with those in 310 healthy control Chinese and with those in 80 Chinese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that the phenotype frequency of HLA-DRw8 [corrected P (Pc)&lt;0.005] and the haplotype frequencies of HLA-DRw8/DQw1 (Pc&lt;0.005), -DRw8/DQw5(w1) (Pc&lt;0.0005), -DRw12(5)/DQw1 (Pc&lt;0.005), -DRw12(5)/DQw6(w1) (Pc&lt; 0.0005), and -DRw52/DQw1 (Pc&lt;0.005) in patients with the MC type of BD were significantly greater than those in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that individual Chinese with HLA-DRw8 antigen and HLA-DRw8/DQw1, -DRw8/DQw5(w1), -DRw12(5)/DQw1, -DRw12(5)/DQw6(w1) and -DRw52/DQw1 haplotypes are more likely to have the MC type of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the relative risks (RRs) of HLA-DRw8/DQw1 (5.6), -DRw8/ DQw5 (w1) (10.0), and -DRw12(5)/DQw6(w1) (14.4) haplotypes in patients with the MC type of BD were equal to or higher than the RR of HLA-DRw8 phenotype (5.6), suggesting that some of the HLA-DR/DQ haplotypes may play more important roles than the individual HLA-DR and -DQ phenotypes for the development of the MC type of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotype frequencies of HLA-DR5 (Pc&lt;0.01), -DRw8 (Pc&lt;0.005) and -DQw1 (Pc&lt;0.05) as well as the haplotype frequencies of HLA-DR5/DQw1 (P&lt;0.005) and -DRw8/DQw1 (Pc&lt;0.00005) in patients with the MC type of BD were significantly higher than those in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the RRs of HLA-DR5/DQw1 (29.1) and -DRw8/DQw1 (47.4) haplotypes were greater than the RRs of HLA-DR5 (10.4), -DRw8 (23.4) and -DQw1 (4.0) antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some specific HLA-DR/DQ haplotypes may be more important than the individual HLA-DR and -DQ phenotypes in the disease shift from <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> to the MC type of BD </plain></SENT>
