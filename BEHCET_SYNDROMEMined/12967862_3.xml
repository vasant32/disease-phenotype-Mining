<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) characterized by multisystemic disorders has many kinds of ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report one case of BD with unusual neutrophil infiltration under a soft contact lens (SCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 31-year-old woman diagnosed as having BD exhibited bilateral recurrent phlyctenular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000491'>keratitis</z:hpo> and finally developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100583'>corneal perforation</z:hpo> in the cornea of her right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: A therapeutic SCL was immediately fitted on the right cornea as a bandage and another SCL on the left, as prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White gelatinous membrane suddenly appeared between the bandage SCL and the cornea in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After peeling off this gelatinous membrane from the cornea, we examined it after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also measured the levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) both in the tears of the patient and on the surface of the SCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A great amount of neutrophils had infiltrated into this gelatinous membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data showed a marked increase of IL-8 levels both on the SCL and in the reflex tears (right SCL, 4980 pg/mL; left SCL, 6810 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reflex tears: right, 2080 pg/mL; left, 2170 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the association between the IL-8 level and the disease activity in BD, and provides additional evidence that a BD attack can be induced on the ocular surface under certain conditions </plain></SENT>
