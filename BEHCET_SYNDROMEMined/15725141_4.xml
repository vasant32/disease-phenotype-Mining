<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were referred to our cardiovascular surgery department for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of them were operated and two were treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients that were managed medically had left anterior descending (LAD) lesions below 80% and their stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> responded well to medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no early mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient developed pseudoaneurysm of ascending aorta and femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient died in the late postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up the operated patients were in Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Class I, while the medically treated patients were in CCS Class II </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The affected patients are usually young males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Coronary artery bypass grafting is also rarely performed in these patients and long-term results of such operations are not available in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We present five patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease that had CAD, three operated and two medically treated, and report their long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest a conservative approach in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease because of the high risk of pseudoaneurysm formation in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If CABG cannot be avoided we recommend operating the patients on the beating heart with minimal aortic manipulation </plain></SENT>
