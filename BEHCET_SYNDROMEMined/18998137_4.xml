<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since NRAMP1 plays a role in the up-regulation of the TNF-alpha, iNOS and MHC expression, it may also be a candidate gene for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the association of NRAMP1 polymorphisms [(GT)( n ), INT4, 3'UTR and D543N] in 102 Turkish patients with BS and 102 healthy subjects by using amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a significant association between BS and NRAMP1 INT4 G/C allele frequency (p = 0.004, OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.21-2.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences in the distribution of allele frequencies of NRAMP1 (GT)( n ), 3'UTR, D543N polymorphisms between BS patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation between NRAMP1 polymorphisms and clinical manifestations of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that NRAMP1 may be one of the plausible candidate genes for BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is likely that INT4 polymorphism is not disease-specific and seems to be common to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
