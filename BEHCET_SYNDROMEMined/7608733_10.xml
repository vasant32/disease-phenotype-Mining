<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 27-year-old man with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo> of the right hand and leg, but without <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a discrete lesion in the internal segment of the left globus pallidus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPECT (single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography) disclosed increased perfusion in the hand and leg area of the left motor cortex and ipsilateral thalamus compared to that of the corresponding regions on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo> was considered to be produced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> of the motor cortex due to loss of inhibitory inputs from the ipsilateral pallidum via the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Double transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed loss of suppression (loss of intracortical inhibition) of the left motor cortex while it showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> suppression on the right, even though conventional techniques of magnetic stimulation failed to show any changes in excitability of the left motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that it is possible to detect changes of motor cortical excitability caused by dysfunction of some inputs from the basal ganglia by using the double cortical stimulation technique here described </plain></SENT>
