<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive Japanese patients with BD and 107 healthy control subjects were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods for endothelial NOS polymorphisms in intron 4, exon 7, and promoter region; inducible NOS polymorphisms in exon 16 and promoter region; <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD Ala16Val polymorphism; and extracellular SOD Arg213Gly polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51 alleles, which have been found to be associated with BD, were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD Val16 increased significantly in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD-Val/Val genotype and HLA-B*5101 had a synergistic role in controlling susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the frequencies of endothelial NOS, inducible NOS, and extracellular SOD gene polymorphisms between patients with BD and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD Val16 allele is associated with the development of BD in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracellular SOD, endothelial NOS, and inducible NOS gene polymorphisms do not constitute a risk factor for developing BD in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> SOD gene polymorphism seems to contribute to BD </plain></SENT>
