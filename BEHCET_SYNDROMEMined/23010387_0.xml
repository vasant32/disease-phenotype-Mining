<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the switching of anti-TNF-α agents for treatment failure remains unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to describe the efficacy and safety of a second anti-TNF-α agent in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients after failure of a first agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective case series, 34 Behçet's disease patients receiving anti-TNF-α agents, 19 of whom switched to a second anti-TNF-α agent, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the response to anti-TNF-α agents, the duration of anti-TNF-α therapy, the reasons for withdrawal, adverse events, the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF), C-reactive protein (CRP), ESR and concomitant therapies at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the first and second anti-TNF-α therapies, and after 6, 12 and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical improvements were seen in 26/34 (76%) after the first and 18/19 (95%) after the second anti-TNF-α agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuation rates at 24 months were 14.4% after the first and 22.3% after the second anti-TNF-α agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequent reason for discontinuation was secondary failure in both groups (12 after the first anti-TNF-α agent and 8 after the second) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal were seen in 10 after the first anti-TNF-α agent and three after the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONLUSIONS: The second anti-TNF-α agent in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease demonstrated similar efficacy to that seen with the first agent without new safety concerns, supporting switching to a second anti-TNF-α agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, long-term continuation rates for anti-TNF-α therapy were low after both the first and second agents </plain></SENT>
