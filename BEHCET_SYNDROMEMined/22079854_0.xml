<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The involvement of the cardiovascular system in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> may result in serious morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity which is an indicator of arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> capacity may predict cardiovascular risk of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulse wave velocity is inversely proportional to arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> capacity leads to a reduction in arterial blood pressure and flow dynamics and impairment in coronary perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our study, we examined pulse wave velocity in frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory rheumatologic diseases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 98 subjects participated in our study including 24 patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (4 males, 20 females; mean age 42.5 ± 11.5 years), 22 patients with newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (1 male, 21 females; mean age 35.8 ± 11.1 years), 33 patients with newly diagnosed <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (26 males, 7 females; mean age 32.7 ± 8.0 years), and 19 healthy subjects in the control group (10 males, 9 females; mean age 36.2 ± 15.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aorta pulse wave velocity was determined by Complior Colson (Createch Industrie, Garges les Gonesses, France) device which allowed for pulse wave recording and automated measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pulse wave velocity was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease groups compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables were included in the regression analysis only age was found to affect pulse wave velocity independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pulse wave velocity was found to be high in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, no difference was found between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age was determined as the most important independent variable in the regression analysis </plain></SENT>
