<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a need for a laboratory marker that correlates with the clinical activity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether serum galectin-3 (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3) levels were affected during the course of the disease with regard to disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 131 subjects were involved in the study as follows: Group 1: BD active (n = 39); Group 2: BD inactive (n = 31); Group 3: Disease controls with leucocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> confirmed with a skin biopsy (n = 22); and Group 4: Healthy control subjects (n = 39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BD patients were followed regularly and samples were taken in their active and inactive periods of the disease over a 2-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels were significantly higher in active BD patients (mean 2.38) than inactive BD patients (mean 0.63; P &lt; 0.0001) and the healthy control subjects (mean 0.75; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the leucocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and active BD patients (P = 0.093) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels were positively correlated with clinical activity scores of active BD patients (r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels were significantly higher in the active disease period when compared with the inactive period during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the two inactive periods of the disease among the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analyses revealed that patients with vascular involvement had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels than the other active BD patients (mean 7.57; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The limitation of the study is the small number of patients with vascular involvement in the active BD patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels are correlated with the activity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease especially with the vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
