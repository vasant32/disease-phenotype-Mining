<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Greater attention has been recently paid to the role of certain strains of streptococcus as an etiologic agent of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, in which <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T cell abnormalities</z:mp> are considered to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether T cells from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease might to be stimulated by Streptococcus sanguis-related antigen (RRE KTH-1 antigens) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cells from 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, but not those from 13 healthy individuals or from 13 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, were stimulated to produce greater amounts of interleukin 6 (IL6) by addition of RRE KTH-1 antigens [stimulation index: 3.96 +/- 0.56 and 1.35 +/- 0.28 or 1.83 +/- 0.43 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IL6 production by T cells required the presence of either fresh or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi>-fixed monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhancement of T cell IL6 production was not related to the presence of HLA-B51, which has been shown to be frequently associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that T cells from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are stimulated by streptococcal antigens to produce IL6 through T cell-monocyte interactions in which binding of the antigens to monocytes, but not necessarily processing of the antigens by monocytes, is involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RRE KTH-1 antigens as well as Escherichia coli-derived antigens also enhanced the production of interferon-gamma by T cells from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data thus suggest that T cell hypersensitivity to several <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens may play a central role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
