<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As N-acetyltransferase (NAT) 2 is an important <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi>-metabolizing enzyme and theoretically the nonacetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> may induce an autoimmune mechanism, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the genetic polymorphism of NAT2 plays a role in susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients and 82 control subjects were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NAT2*5A, NAT2*6A, NAT27*A/B and NAT2*14A polymorphisms were detected by using real time PCR with LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NAT2*5A and NAT2*6A mutant genotypes carried an increased risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> [odds ratio (OR) = 66.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.21-535.33; and OR = 24; 95% CI = 2.04-304.98, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The NAT2*7A/B and NAT2*14A gene polymorphisms were not an increased risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of this study we conclude the NAT2 slow acetylator status may be a determinant in susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding may have implications for the theories of the pathogenesis of the disease as well as for therapeutic aspects </plain></SENT>
