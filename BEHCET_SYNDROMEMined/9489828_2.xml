<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma granulocyte elastase-alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (E-PI) complex levels were measured by ELISA in 11 healthy subjects and 19 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight of 19 patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> on (99m)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-macro-agglutinate albumin venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemostatic variables were measured at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma E-PI complex level was significantly higher in the 8 patients with than in the 11 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (242 +/- 73 vs 165 +/- 97 ng/ml; p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma E-PI complex level in the 11 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was significantly higher than in controls (165 +/- 97 vs 96 +/- 40 ng/ml; p = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma E-PI complex levels correlated with the serum plasmin-alpha2-plasmin inhibitor complex levels (r = 0.621, p = 0.0084) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma E-PI complex levels appear to be a useful marker of thromboembolic vasculopathy in BD </plain></SENT>
