<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, there are no laboratory markers that correlate well with the clinical activity in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has led to the development of an instrument (BD Current Activity Form) to measure activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scoring is based on the history of new clinical features present over the preceding 4 weeks prior to assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standardized questions were developed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The face validity of the proforma was determined following worldwide collaboration with physicians and ophthalmologists managing patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the interobserver reliability of this form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients fulfilling the International Study Group criteria for BD were randomly allocated, questioned and examined independently on the same day by five physicians experienced in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was good agreement between the physicians' rating of oral [intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) = 0.87] and genital (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.95) ulceration, skin involvement (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.62 for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustules</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.66 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.62), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.80), large vessel (kappa = 0.53), <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (kappa = 0.61) and eye involvement (kappa = 0.77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was poor agreement for the question relating to the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bloody diarrhoea</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was significant bias in the rating of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> by one of the physicians (F = 5.2, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overall, this instrument has good interobserver reliability for assessing general disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that this proforma has a place in routine clinical monitoring of patients with BD, as well as assessing outcome in therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
