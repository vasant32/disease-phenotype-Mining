<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They promote assembly and disassembly of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> and play a major role in cellular function, not only during the stress response but also at basal state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: As <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> are immunogenic molecules and can be expressed on cellular membranes, their role in auto-immune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, particularly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, has been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular immune response of T cells and humoral response with antibodies production against <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> occurring in the course of those diseases have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: Anti-<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> immune response might provide better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in those diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At present it is not known whether <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> can trigger them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, anti-<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> immunity could be induced by the immunological process or be part of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immunoregulatory response </plain></SENT>
