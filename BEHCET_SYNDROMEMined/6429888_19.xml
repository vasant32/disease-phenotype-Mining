<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This finding has been related to impaired production and/or release of plasminogen activators from the vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In previous studies a diminished release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> upon <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> stimuli was observed in plasma from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and interpreted as an additional indicator for endothelial cell dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present investigations, 12 patients and 10 healthy volunteers received DDAVP infusions and euglobulin clot lysis time, factor VIII activities and 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> levels in plasma were repeatedly determined before and after infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At different times following DDAVP infusion, euglobulin clot lysis time was significantly longer and levels of F.VIII R:Ag were lower in patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VIII:C activity increased in both groups, whereas no changes were seen in the plasma levels of 6-Keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> either in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> or in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the disseminated damage of endothelial tissue associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease correlates with multiple endothelial cell dysfunctions and subsequent hemostatic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
