<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of this and of its distressing nature patients are attracted by any new concepts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a reaction to this neurologists are sometimes excessively sceptical and fail to consider new approaches seriously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent attempts have been made to treat multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="26208">polyunsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach is not arbitrary and is firmly grounded in fundamental basic scientific concepts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> there is evidence of both an abnormality in essential fatty acid metabolism and an abnormality in lymphocyte function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is now apparent that the fatty acid abnormality may cause the lymphocyte abnormality and that both may be improved by dietary manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> may be associated with recurrent inflammatory episodes and with entry of calcium into the cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> has been shown to have actions compatible with regulation of cytoplasmic calcium and in two diseases characterised by intermittent inflammatory episodes (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§ets syndrome and familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>) it has been found to prevent or to reduce the severity of such episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results suggest that combined therapy with evening primrose oil and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> may be of considerable value </plain></SENT>
