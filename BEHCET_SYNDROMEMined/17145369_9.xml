<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> associated with six human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allomorphs expressed by the U937 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> were isolated by mild acid elution or by MHC class I immunoprecipitation by using W6/32 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were sequenced by mass spectrometry, and their putative binding alleles were assigned using bioinformatic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only three <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> isolated by the two approaches were identical, suggesting that the approaches may yield distinct partially overlapping <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild acid treatment-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> manifested overall characteristics suggestive of relatively lower affinity of binding for MHC class I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a large proportion of putative HLA-B*5101-binding <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> was evident among the mild acid treatment-eluted <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and to a lesser degree in the affinity-purified <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HLA-B*5101 may bind a potentially large pool of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> with relatively lower affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that lower affinity of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding may be the basis for inefficient tolerance to HLA-B*5101-binding self-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, a predisposing factor for the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease </plain></SENT>
