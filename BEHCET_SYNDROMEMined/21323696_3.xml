<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of the IL-4 and IL-4Rα gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to BD was investigated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were obtained from a Turkish population of 97 patients with BD and 76 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genotyping (IL-4 and IL-4Rα) experiments were performed using PCR sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with the healthy controls, the frequency of IL-4 -1098 TG and -590 CT genotypes was higher in the patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of allele frequencies showed that IL-4 -1098 G and IL-4 -590 T alleles were more common in the patients with BD when compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, IL-4 TTC and haplotypes were found to confer BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we demonstrated that IL-4Rα gene polymorphism seems to be associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test positivity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that IL-4 gene promoter polymorphisms may affect susceptibility to BD and increase risk of developing the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in order to confirm and assess the association of IL-4 and IL-4Rα gene polymorphisms with the BD, large cohort studies are needed </plain></SENT>
