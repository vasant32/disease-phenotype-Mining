<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease on higher cognitive functions is still poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We proposed (1) to characterize the neuropsychological profile of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with (Neuro-BD) and without (BD) neurological manifestations; (2) to identify which clinical, psychopathological, and genetic variables are related to neuropsychological performance; and (3) to explore the association between cognitive functioning and neuroimaging findings in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen Neuro-BD and 35 BD patients in the nonactive phase of their illness underwent a neurological examination, performed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, and answered the hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 genotyping was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients' neuropsychological performances were compared to those of healthy demographically matched subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within one month from the testing date, a subset of 20-BD patients underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three percent of Neuro-BD and 40% of BD patients were impaired at least on one neuropsychological measure (i.e., digit span-forward) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Poorer cognitive functioning in Neuro-BD was associated with parenchymal involvement, whereas in BD it was related to presence of white matter changes in the frontal lobes, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> complaints, or higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> intake had a positive impact on neuropsychological performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease duration, time since <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological manifestations, or presence of HLA-B*51 allele had no significant influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may affect cognitive abilities in the absence of overt neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings point to an insidious course of neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
