<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 817 patients fulfilling the international criteria for BD from a single center in France were analyzed for causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and the factors associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 817 patients with BD, 41 (5%) died after a median followup of 7.7 years, of whom 95.1% were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean ± SD age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 34.8 ± 11.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included major vessel disease (mainly, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo>) (43.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and malignant hemopathy (14.6%), central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement (12.2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (12.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate at 1 year and 5 years was 1.2% and 3.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increased mortality among patients ages 15-24 years (SMR 2.99, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.54-5.39) and those ages 25-34 years (SMR 2.90, 95% CI 1.80-4.49) as compared with age-and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality decreased in patients older than age 35 years (SMR 1.23, 95% CI 0.75-1.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 4.94, 95% CI 1.53-16.43), arterial involvement (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90), and a high number of BD flares (HR 2.37, 95% CI 1.09-5.14) were independently associated with the risk of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The overall mortality in our BD cohort was 5% after a median followup of 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male sex, arterial involvement, and the number of flares were associated with mortality in BD </plain></SENT>
