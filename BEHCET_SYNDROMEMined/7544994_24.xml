<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The findings in 11 positive and one negative SPR lesions of patients with BD were evaluated in comparison with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adjacent skin and with the negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> biopsies from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positive SPR biopsies showed variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0011368'>epidermal thickening</z:hpo> and cell vacuolization, as well as subcorneal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustule</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the SPR dermis, a variable dense focal mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltrate was seen around vessels and skin appendages, extending into the deep dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MNC infiltrate was predominantly composed of T lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the T lymphocytes were CD4+, and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> expressed CD45RO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately half of the infiltrating cells strongly expressed HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils constituted less than 5% of the infiltrating cells, but were present as clusters of elastase-positive cells at the needle-prick sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vessels within the lesion showed marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and endothelial swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The endothelial cells expressed ICAM-1 strongly, and E-selectin moderately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VCAM-1 was not expressed on endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The basal and mid-epidermal layers of keratinocytes expressed HLA-DR and ICAM-1 strongly, particularly so in areas close to the dermal MNC infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> biopsies, there were increased numbers of neutrophils and a few small clusters of macrophages and T lymphocytes only at the needle-prick site, and the endothelial cells of vessels close to these areas expressed E-selectin weakly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
