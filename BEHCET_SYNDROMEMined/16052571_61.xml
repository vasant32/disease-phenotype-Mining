<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of infliximab on the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks and the visual prognosis in male patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was resistant to combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised patients who were receiving combination therapy but experienced at least 2 attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> during the 6-month period prior to enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) were administered at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weeks 0-22 were defined as the infusion period, and weeks 23-54 were defined as the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients continued to receive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was discontinued after the screening visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measures were the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks during the infusion period (remission), and the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks throughout the study period (sustained remission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks involving the posterior segment occurred during the previous-treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the infusion period, 4 patients (30.8%) remained attack-free, and 9 patients had a total of 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten of these attacks (76.9%) occurred at either week 14 or week 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of 13 patients fulfilled the definition of sustained remission, and the remaining 12 patients had a total of 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks and daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> doses were significantly lower during the infusion period than during the previous-treatment period or the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although potential visual acuity was regained following infliximab infusion, this beneficial effect was not preserved until week 54 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced a serious adverse event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that infliximab is effective in suppressing the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks, has a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-sparing effect, and has favorable implications for the visual prognosis of patients with resistant <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
