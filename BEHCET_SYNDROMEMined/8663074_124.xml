<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cDNA encoding a novel member of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) family, MAPKK6, was isolated and found to encode a protein of 334 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 37 kDa that is 79% identical to MKK3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MAPKK6 was shown to phosphorylate and specifically activate the p38/MPK2 subgroup of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase superfamily and could be demonstrated to be phosphorylated and activated in vitro by TAK1, a recently identified MAPKK kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MKK3 was also shown to be a good substrate for TAK1 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when co-expressed with TAK1 in cells in culture, both MAPKK6 and MKK3 were strongly activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, co-expression of TAK1 and p38/MPK2 in cells resulted in activation of p38/MPK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the existence of a novel kinase cascade consisting of TAK1, MAPKK6/MKK3, and p38/MPK2 </plain></SENT>
