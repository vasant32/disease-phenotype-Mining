<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors studied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) angiographic features in proven cases of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients (18 male, 8 female; mean age 39.9 +/- 8.9 years) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease underwent simultaneous ICG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography (FA) according to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> angiographic standard protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups based on their ocular disease duration: Group A (9 patients), less than 3-year duration; Group B (8 patients), 4- to 10-year duration; Group C (9 patients), more than 10-year duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relation between ICG angiographic findings and ocular disease duration and FA signs was delimited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three findings were disclosed by ICG angiography: 1) poorly defined areas of intermediate and late hyperfluorescence (50% of eyes); 2) well-defined hypofluorescent areas becoming isofluorescent in the late phase (26.92% of eyes); and 3) large, poorly defined hypofluorescent areas visible up to the late phase (30.77% of eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of ICG hypofluorescent areas up to the late phase was related to disease duration (P = 0.01), whereas ICG hypofluorescent areas becoming isofluorescent in the late phase were predominant in patients in early stages of ocular disease (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of FA signs did not indicate any significant correlation with the presence or absence of signs revealed by ICG angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">Indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography enabled the identification of different choroidal abnormalities related to the ocular disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of some ICG findings undetectable with FA suggests that ICG and FA are complementary means to diagnose and monitor ocular vascular involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
