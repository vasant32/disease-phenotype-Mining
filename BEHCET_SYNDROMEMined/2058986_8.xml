<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was found in 12 patients, 2 of whom revealed sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two other patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome showed a vestibular function deficit, and 3 others exhibited altered caloric stimulation test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these last patients also revealed a simultaneous bilateral auditory deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA typing showed the presence of the B51 antigen in 10 of the 14 patients with ear involvement, while only 3 of the 6 patients without ear involvement were HLA-B51-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that audiovestibular involvement is common in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome: sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> may be the first sign of ear disturbance; vestibular lesions may represent an early sign of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome; and the HLA-B51 antigen is associated with ear involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Otoneurologic study can reveal hidden brain stem lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients during flare-ups of the disease, even without obvious signs of neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
