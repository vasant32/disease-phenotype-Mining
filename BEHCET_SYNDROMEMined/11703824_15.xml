<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the different HLA-B*51 suballeles among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) of German (n=33) and Turkish (n=92) origin in comparison to their presence in the respective ethnically matched healthy control groups (German: n=325, Turkish: n=93) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51x was significantly increased in both patient groups in comparison to the controls (Germans: 58% vs. 12%, OR 9.76, P&lt;0.001; Turkish: 75% vs. 25%, OR 9.13, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular subtyping of B*51x revealed HLA-B*51011 and B*5108 as the predominant suballeles in both patient groups and controls although with a slightly increased frequency of HLA-B*5108 in the diseased individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*5105 was the only further HLA-B*51x subtype detected in one Turkish patient heterozygous also for HLA-B*5101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*5107 although present in a Turkish as well as German control was absent in the patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was also a tendency towards a higher degree of homozygosity for HLA-B*51x in both patient groups versus the matched controls (Germans: 10% in patients vs. 2,5% in controls; Turkish: 27% in patients vs. 13% in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study further supports previous hypothesis of an association of BD with B51 suballeles which share <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33708">amino-acid residues</z:chebi> at positions 63 and 67 as well as at positions 77-83 for specific <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> binding and natural killer (NK)-cell interactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This applies to HLA-B*5101 and B*5108, but not to HLA-B*5107 different at position 67, which could be negatively associated with BD </plain></SENT>
