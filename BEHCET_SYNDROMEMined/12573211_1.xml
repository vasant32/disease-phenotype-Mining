<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most adverse reactions affect gastrointestinal system, liver and skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011609" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug eruption</z:e> although very unusual, has also been described, but with cutaneous involvement exclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 49-year-old man who suffered three episodes of fixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011609" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug eruption</z:e> with cutaneous-mucosal involvement, even simulating an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, whenever he was treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: He was patch tested on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin with the GEIDC standard series and an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was patch tested on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin and on fixed eruption with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi>, meloxicam and tenoxicam (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them 1 % pet) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral challenge test was not performed due to the severity and reproducibility in previous reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed a positive patch test to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> (1 % pet) on fixed eruption, with negative results to the rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions may present a wide variability of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these situations an accurate clinical history is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the 1st report of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1274934" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">non-pigmenting fixed drug eruption</z:e> with cutaneous-mucosal involvement due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8249">piroxicam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cross-reactivity between oxicams could not be demonstrated by patch test on fixed eruption </plain></SENT>
