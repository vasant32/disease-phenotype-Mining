<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is no reliable laboratory marker that indicates disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neopterin is an immunological marker of cellular immune activation, which is secreted by monocytes/macrophages as a result of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretion by activated T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate serum and urine neopterin levels in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients who were diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Study Group for BD and 45 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was considered by clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum and urine neopterin levels and serum IFN-gamma levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean values of serum and urine neopterin levels were 12.68 +/- 4.87 nmol/L and 167.53 +/- 148.73 micromol/mol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>, respectively, in BD patients (P = 0.000 and P = 0.008, respectively), which were statistically significantly different from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant statistical difference between serum and urine neopterin levels of the clinically active and inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was also found that the mean value of serum IFN-gamma levels was higher in healthy controls than in BD patients (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that serum and urinary neopterin measurement can not be used as a reliable laboratory marker as the BD patients' serum and urinary neopterin levels do not increase in the active stage even though these levels increase when compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
