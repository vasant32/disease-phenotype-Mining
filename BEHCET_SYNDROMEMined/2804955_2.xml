<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While part of this phenomenon is undoubtedly due to a direct action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> on the lymphocytes themselves, it seems likely that indirect action of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> such as inhibition of lymphokine or interleukin production may deprive lymphocytes of proliferative and other stimuli and therefore also play some part in the overall response </plain></SENT>
