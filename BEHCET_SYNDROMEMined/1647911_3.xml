<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral B lymphocytes infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were cultured for 20 days in the presence or absence of autologous T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin M and G secretions into the supernatants were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of suppression of EBV-induced B cell activation by autologous T cells was significantly decreased in active BD patients as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects at a T:B ratio of 1:1, whereas the suppression ratio was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at a T:B ratio of 4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IgM and IgG secretions in purified B cell cultures were significantly higher in active BD patients as compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, an increased B cell function associated with a defective EBV-specific T cell suppressive function could explain at least in part the immunological disorders in BD patients </plain></SENT>
