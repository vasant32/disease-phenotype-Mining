<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have evaluated T cell subsets in the peripheral blood of patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, using a panel of anti-T cell monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome show a discrepancy between the number of T3+ cells and those forming rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, a significantly higher number of T4+ and T8+ double labelled cells, as well as of T6+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of T8 T lymphocytes is increased, thus lowering the T4+/T8+ cell ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that a complex imbalance of T cell subsets is present in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and give a rationale for possible treatment of these patients with immunomodulators </plain></SENT>
