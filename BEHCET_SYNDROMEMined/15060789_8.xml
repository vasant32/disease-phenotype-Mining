<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A prospective evaluation of the ocular blood flow velocity in patients with BehCet's disease was carried out to determine its changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were divided into three groups: those with ocular involvement in BehCet's disease (group I), those without ocular involvement in BehCet's disease (group II), and a control group (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven eyes in group I and 28 eyes each in groups II and III were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood flow in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA), ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>), nasal posterior ciliary artery (NPCA), and the temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA) was measured using color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) to determine the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistivity index (RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow velocity of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein (CRV) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results were then compared among the three groups of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PSV values of CRA in groups I and II were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group ( P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.018, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PSV values of CRA in group I were found to be significantly lower than those in group II ( P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EDV values of CRA in groups I and II were found to be significantly lower than those in the control group ( P&lt; 0.001, P = 0.034, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EDV values of CRA in group I were significantly lower than those in group II ( P = 0.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PSV values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> in group I were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EDV values of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> in group I were significantly lower than those values in group II or the control group ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.037, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The PSV values of NPCA in group I were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The PSV values of TPCA in groups I and II were significantly lower than those in the control group ( P&lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The EDV values of TPCA in group I were significantly lower than those values in group II or the control group ( P = 0.014 and P = 0.003, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the mean blood flow values of the CRV among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups ( P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are significant reductions in the blood flow values of the orbital arteries in patients with BehCet's disease, and they are more evident in those with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This might be the result of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, which is frequently seen in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels of patients with BehCet's disease </plain></SENT>
