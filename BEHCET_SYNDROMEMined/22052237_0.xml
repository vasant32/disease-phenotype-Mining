<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the major immunologic findings in BD pathogenesis is increase in activity of neutrophil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in the cytosolic free Ca²⁺[Ca²⁺](i) concentration that induces Ca²⁺ signaling is an important step that participates in the neutrophil activation and reactive oxygen species production that leads to tissue damage in body cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and Ca²⁺ release in serum and neutrophil of BD patients with active and inactive periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients (6 active and 6 inactive) and 6 control subject were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was considered by clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum and neutrophil samples were obtained from the patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils from patients with active BD were divided into three subgroups and were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> + diltiazem, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> + diltiazem, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leucocytes counts, serum C-reactive protein, neutrophil, and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and intracellular Ca²⁺ release levels were higher in active and inactive groups than in the control group, although their levels were lower in active group than in inactive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, neutrophil Ca²⁺ release levels were decreased in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> + diltiazem, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> + diltiazem groups group compared to active group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, vitamin A, vitamin E, and β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> concentrations were lower in active and inactive groups than in the control group, although serum vitamin E and β-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> concentrations were higher in the inactive group than in the active group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity within the three groups did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we observed the importance of Ca²⁺ influx into the neutrophils and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the pathogenesis and activation of the patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> induced protective effects on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by modulating Ca²⁺ influx in BD patients </plain></SENT>
