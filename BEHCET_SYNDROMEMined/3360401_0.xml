<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, with an electron microscope, the peripheral blood neutrophils of 6 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease at the exacerbation stage and those of 3 healthy controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of microtubules was counted on enlarged electron micrographs of the neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each electron micrograph was taken at a direct magnification of 15,000, so that at least one centriole was contained in the photograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was enlarged twice the size of the negative and printed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average number of microtubules in the neutrophils of the patients was 4.96 +/- 2.76 (SD) and 2.36 +/- 1.88 (SD) in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically highly significant (p less than 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes of 24 patients and those of 13 healthy controls were examined with an indirect immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution and the pattern of the microtubules differed between the patients at the exacerbation stage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and also between the patients at the exacerbation stage and the remission stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that microtubules may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
