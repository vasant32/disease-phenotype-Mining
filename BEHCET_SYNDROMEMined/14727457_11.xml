<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the presence of MEFV mutations in BD patients from Turkey, a country with a high prevalence of both disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The frequencies of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-related MEFV mutations (M694V, M680I and V726A) were investigated in BD patients (n = 57) by molecular genetic studies using a polymerase chain reaction with the ARMS method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for the diagnosis of BD and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-like symptoms or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen BD patients were found to carry one single MEFV mutation (26%), compared to 9.1% in the control group (p = 0.003, OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.6-7.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 20 BD patients with vascular involvement, 11 (55%) had MEFV mutations compared to 4 patients (11%) in the non-vascular group (p = 0.001, OR: 10, 95% CI: 2.5-39.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M694V was the dominant mutation in our study group (11 out of 15 patients with mutated alleles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six out of 7 female patients with vascular involvement carried MEFV mutations in contrast to 5 out of 13 male patients (85.7% versus 38.4%, p = 0.07, OR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.009-1.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No association with other clinical manifestations was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MEFV mutations, originally linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, may act as a genetic susceptibility factor for other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> such as vascular BD </plain></SENT>
