<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased arterial stiffness and pressure wave reflections may provide a pathophysiological link between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and increased cardiovascular risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Adamantiades-Behcet disease</z:e> (ABD), a relapsing inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, is associated with impaired arterial properties modulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> on arterial properties during the active state of ABD is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 47 subjects with ABD, under no <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment, we examined pressure wave reflections (augmentation index, AIx) and central pressures by pulse wave analysis, as well as local aortic stiffness and left ventricular function by high resolution ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty subjects with similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subjects with active ABD (n=11) had lower AIx and central systolic blood pressure (CSBP), but similar peripheral blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, and slightly higher local aortic stiffness in comparison to patients with inactive ABD (n=36) (Alx: 12.6 +/- 11.4 vs. 23.2 +/- 19.1%, p=0.009; CSBP 104.2 +/- 12.4 vs. 115.4 +/- 15.7 mmHg, p=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The arrival of the reflected pressure wave within the cardiac cycle was significantly delayed in subjects with active ABD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low values of AIx (&lt;10.5%) predicted with 73% sensitivity the presence of active ABD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ABD, not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, have decreased pressure wave reflections and CSBP in the presence of active disease, possibly due to peripheral arterial vasodilation, but not due to altered left ventricular or aortic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the role of low AIx in the presence of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> need to be investigated further </plain></SENT>
