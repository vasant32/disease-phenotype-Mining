<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased incidence of HLA-B51 in the patient group has also been reported in an Italian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the B51 antigen has been recently identified to comprise nine alleles, B*5101-B*5109, we performed HLA-B51 allele genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method as well as serological HLA-A and -B typing among 21 Italian patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in order to investigate whether there is any correlation of one particular B51-associated allele with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA class II genotyping was performed by the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, only the phenotype frequency of the B51 antigen was found to be significantly increased in the patient group as compared to the ethnically matched control group by the corrected P-value analysis (71.4% in patients vs. 17.9% in controls; chi2 = 14.26, Pc = 0.0042, R.R. = 11.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the B51 allele genotyping, 11 out of 15 B51-positive patients were B*5101 and the remaining four were B*5108, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were B*5101, showing significant association of each allele with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between the patient and control groups in the HLA class II allelic distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study revealed a strong association of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Italian with B*5108 as well as B*5101, providing important insight into the molecular mechanism underlying an HLA association with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
