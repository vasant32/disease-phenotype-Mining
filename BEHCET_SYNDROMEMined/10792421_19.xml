<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of both soluble and tissue ICAM-1 is increased in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) but the contribution of ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms to this disease remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Associations with BD have been reported for genes within the MHC, including HLA-B51, TNF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>, but the role of non-MHC genes in BD remains largely unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the frequency of the R/G 241 and K/E 469 ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms in 83 patients with BD disease and 103 healthy controls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of Palestinian and Jordanian descent, and demonstrated an association between BD and the ICAM-1 E469 allele (Pc = 0.046, OR = 2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients, no association was found between the presence of ocular disease and ICAM-1 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the functional correlate of this polymorphism remains unclear, this finding indicates that a genetic polymorphism in the ICAM-1 gene domain, which is independent of the MHC, may contribute to disease </plain></SENT>
