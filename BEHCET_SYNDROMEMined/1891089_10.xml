<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oligoclonal IgA and IgM bands were mainly detected in CSF samples from patients with active neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and were documented to disappear when neurologic manifestations remit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oligoclonal IgG bands, however, were not related to disease activity and were also found in some neurologic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High immunoglobulin index values were detected in both active and quiescent diseases and were high in some patients with impaired blood-CSF barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study presented here demonstrates that CSF oligoclonal IgA and IgM may be helpful in monitoring <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease activity in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's and could be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
