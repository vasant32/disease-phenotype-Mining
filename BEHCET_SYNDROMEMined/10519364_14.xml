<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, the phenotype frequency of the B51 antigen was significantly increased in the patient group as compared to the ethnically matched control group (76.9% in patients vs. 22.20% in controls), but no significant difference was observed in HLA-A, -DRB1, -DQB1 or -DPB1 alleles between the patients and controls, as previously observed in Japanese BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, by HLA-B51 allelic genotyping performed by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) method, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the B51-positive patients and controls were found to carry one particular allele, B*5101, except one patient with B*5108 </plain></SENT>
