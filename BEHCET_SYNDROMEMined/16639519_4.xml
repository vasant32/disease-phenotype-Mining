<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients diagnosed with BD according to the International Study Group Diagnostic Criteria and 45 healthy subjects as control were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated in terms of clinical findings, the number and site of the joints involved, sacroiliac joint involvement, pain intensity, QoL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The instruments used were Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory (BDI) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, State-Trait <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (STAI-T) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) for health status and QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Joint involvement was seen in 41.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most characteristic form was asymmetric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oligoarthritis</z:e>, which was seen in 65.3% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The joints most commonly involved were found to be in the wrist (53.8%) and knee (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0574960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sacroiliitis</z:e> was found at a rate of 38.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In BD patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, rates of men (p=0.004) and genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (p=0.001) were higher, and rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (p=0.001) and human leukocyte antigen B5 positivity (p=0.023) were less than those of BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pain intensity (p=0.000), NHP (p=0.004), and HAQ (p=0.003) scores were significantly higher in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pain intensity, NHP, BDI, and STAI-T scores were significantly higher in BD patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> than in healthy controls, while pain intensity, NHP, HAQ, BDI, and STAI-T scores were significantly higher in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> than in healthy controls (p=0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study establishes that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> is one of the common manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> in BD affects considerably patients' pain levels and QoL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A multistep approach is required for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We are of the opinion that this approach may also improve the QoL of these patients and prevent the activation of the disease </plain></SENT>
