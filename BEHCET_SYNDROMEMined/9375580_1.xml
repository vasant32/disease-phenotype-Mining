<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To develop a sensitive and reproducible technique for measuring the adherence of blood lymphocytes to vessel walls exposed in sections of human retina and for examining the role of lymphocyte and vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cryostat sections of human retina were overlaid with blood lymphocytes from healthy subjects, and experimental conditions were sought by which preferential attachment of the cells occurred to blood vessel walls in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adherent lymphocytes were identified by staining with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> green-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52295">thionine</z:chebi>, and transected blood vessels were identified by their structure and by staining of basement membranes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The adherence of enriched preparations of CD4+ (T-helper) and CD8+ (T-cytotoxic) lymphocytes, of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated cells, and of lymphocytes from patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules on <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel walls was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the contribution of leukocyte integrins to lymphocyte binding was studied by blocking experiments with monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The optimal selectivity of blood lymphocyte attachment to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessel walls occurred when purified lymphocytes were suspended in culture medium with 10% fetal calf serum and overlaid onto <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> sections for 30 minutes at 23 degrees C with gentle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, 92% of the lymphocytes that adhered to the section were confined to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvasculature, and CD4+ T cells were more adherent than CD8+ T cells (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior exposure of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes to IL-2 enhanced their binding to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood vessels, and lymphocytes from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease showed supranormal vascular adherence (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many transected vessels stained positively for CD31; PECAM (mean 62%), CD54; ICAM-1 (mean 73%), CD62E; E-selectin (mean 35%), CD62P; P-selectin (mean 61%), and CD106; VCAM-1 (mean 42%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules occupied &lt; 20% of the area of the blood vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels was more dependent on CD29 (the common chain of the beta 1 integrins) expression than either CD11a/CD18 or CD49d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This technique allows measurements to be made of lymphocyte adherence to vascular and nonvascular structures of retina ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Extension of this approach to the study of leukocyte adherence to sections of pathologic retina may be of clinical and experimental applicability in understanding mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
