<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated anti-endothelial cell antibodies (AECA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen (vWF) levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro effects of patient sera on endothelial cell proliferation were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AECAs were present in 29% of 70 Behçet's disease patients (Binding Index: 25 +/- 29% vs 9 +/- 7% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>95% of AECA positive patients were clinically active compared to 74% of AECA negative patients (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among specific organ manifestations only active <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> correlated with AECA positivity (6 of 7 patients vs 14 of 63, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AECA positive patients had a significantly higher mean ESR (37 +/- 24 mm/h vs 21 +/- 17 mm/h, p:0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean vWF levels were also significantly higher in patients compared to controls (166 +/- 75% vs 84 +/- 34%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlations were observed between AECA titres and vWF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between patients and controls when endothelial cell proliferation was studied (Proliferation Index: 1.25 +/- 0.28 vs 1.12 +/- 0.25, p = 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that AECA may be related to disease activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of vWF, even in patients in complete remission, might be related to factors other than endothelial damage for vWF release from endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
