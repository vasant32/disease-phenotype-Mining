<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, a deficiency in Se appears to result in immunosuppression, whereas supplementation with low doses of Se appears to result in augmentation and/or restoration of immunologic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the distribution of Se and IgG, IgM in serum were compared in samples from healthy adult control and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum Se levels were measured by AA-30-40 Varian Spectra, and immunoglobulins were measured by immunodiffusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) serum Se level of 54.24 +/- 8.06 ng/mL among <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease subjects was significantly different (P less than 0.01) from that in the control subjects (90.01 +/- 9.94 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also measured IgG and IgM as 10.01 +/- 2.74 mg/mL and 1.26 +/- 0.29 mg/mL, respectively for patients, and 15.08 +/- 4.73 mg/mL and 1.58 +/- 0.43 mg/mL for controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean values of IgG and IgM for patients were significantly (P less than 0.05) different from the values of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems, therefore, that a deficiency in <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> impedes the humoral immune response </plain></SENT>
