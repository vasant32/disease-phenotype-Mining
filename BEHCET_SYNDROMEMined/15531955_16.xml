<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is reactive nitrogen intermediate which plays a key role in pathogenesis of many inflammatory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autoimmune skin diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted to determine serum interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels in relation to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels were measured with test kits by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, while serum nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels were determined with a test kit by colorimetric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> concentrations in 27 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and in 16 healthy controls were determined by extrapolation from their standard curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The significance of the mean differences between the 2 groups was assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum levels of IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> concentrations in patients with BD were significantly higher than those of the controls (P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that elevated levels of IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> appear to be related to the disease </plain></SENT>
