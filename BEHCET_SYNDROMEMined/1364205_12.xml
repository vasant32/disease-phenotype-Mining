<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> caused by this disease is severe, often causing significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and, although the nature of the cellular infiltrate has been examined in many of the involved organs, the infiltrating cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflamed eyes</z:e> have not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanisms involved in perpetuating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo>, five enucleated eyes from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were examined by immunohistochemical staining using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control eyes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> from other causes were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cellular infiltrates were a consistent finding in choroid and periretinal scar tissue, formed almost entirely by mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes were found to predominate (largely the CD4+ subset) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B lymphocytes and NK cells were infrequent findings but macrophages were present in significant numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No complement or immunoglobulin deposits were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages were HLA DR positive </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that cell mediated immunity, rather than immune complex deposition is responsible for the perpetuation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and that CD4+ T lymphocytes play a central role in this </plain></SENT>
