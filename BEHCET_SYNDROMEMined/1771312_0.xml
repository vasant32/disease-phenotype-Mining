<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty of these 44 patients received gradually decreasing dilutions of their own saliva, and 14 control patients received physiological saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Injections were administered intradermally twice a week during 15 weeks, then once a week during one year, so that the study lasted one and a half year, from October 1986 to April 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> was observed, whereas the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e> were improved in 50% of the patients desensitized by their own saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This percentage would have raised some hopes for the treatment of these sometimes disabling lesions were it not for the fact that 50% of the controls were similarly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that desensitization by saliva has a placebo effect </plain></SENT>
