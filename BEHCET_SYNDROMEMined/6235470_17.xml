<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparisons are also possible between lymphocytic profiles in the peripheral blood and the precise composition of the in situ infiltrates within the ocular tissue themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The availability of monoclonal antibodies, which can determine T-lymphocytic subsets such as T-helper cells and T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes-histiocytes, has provided a powerful technology for the delineation of the distinctive immune composition of the inflammatory infiltrates, as well as any possible disturbances in T-cell immunoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>B-lymphocytes produce immunoglobulins, which may be misdirected as autoantibodies in local or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin-mediated and therefore B-cell derived conditions include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282359" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="OCP">cicatricial ocular pemphigoid</z:e>, Mooren's <z:mp ids='MP_0009825'>corneal ulcer</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100532'>scleritis</z:hpo>, and hay <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and vernal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000509'>conjunctivitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-cells do not produce immunoglobins, but rather secrete lymphokines or interact directly with receptors or determinants on viruses or target tissues (eg. immunosurveillance against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo>); it is possible that some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> are the result of neo-antigens on the surfaces of host tissues that have been coded for by a cryptic inciting virus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cells are involved in many of the same diseases as cytotoxic T-cells, except that the former require no period of sensitization (natural immunity), whereas cytotoxic T-cells must undergo an antigen-specific blast transformation (acquired immunity of the delayed hypersensitivity type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In many diseases in which B-cell derived auto-antibodies are at fault, there may be local tissue or systemic T-cell imbalances, with a reduction in T-suppressor cells and a relative augmentation in T-helper cells, thereby facilitating production of misdirected auto-antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
