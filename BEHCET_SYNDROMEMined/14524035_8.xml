<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular complications can be seen in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial and venous complications may be found separately or concomitantly in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of 29 patients with vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease 7 patients with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and venous lesions were documented over a period of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were male, ranging in age from 24 to 52 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of the disease was 6 +/- 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were found in the following locations: one pulmonary artery, two abdominal aorta, four iliac, five femoral, and two popliteal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both aneurysmal and occlusive lesions were present in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the venous lesions associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> there were three deep and three superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had caval involvement-superior and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inferior vena caval syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We performed seven interposition grafting by polytetrafloroethylene, one Y-grafting, one aneurysmorrhaphy, one lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Re-anastomosis was performed in two patients who had anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and graft occlusion without disabling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Venous pathologies were treated by medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed up between 1 to 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of the patients with iliac artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> 15 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, when an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has been found in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, the patient should be scanned for possible multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and venous lesions since they might be found together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment, when feasible, should be performed in cases with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> because of a high risk of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility of an anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developing after surgery should also be kept in mind </plain></SENT>
