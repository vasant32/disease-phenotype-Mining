<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Knee US was performed in 30 unselected Italian BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1253936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint effusion</z:e>, synovial proliferation) and presence of bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and Baker's <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Power Doppler evaluation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A semi-quantitative score was used for each structure examined, whereby 0 was to indicate the absence of any change and score from 1 to 3 the presence of mild to severe changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sum of the single scores was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was evaluated to identify the correlation with the US modifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty (66.6%) patients had symptomatic articular involvement and US showed knee involvement in 18 of them (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Synovial proliferation was detected in 14 (46%, positive power Doppler in 4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1253936" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint effusion</z:e> in 14 (46%), bone surface <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in 3 (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients, asymptomatic for joint involvement, showed US alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients showed a total score between 1 and 3, while the other 7 had a score between 4 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a higher US score presented an increased prevalence of acneiform <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> with respect to the group with US score 1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between disease activity and US score in group 2 (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirms that peripheral joint involvement represents an important clinical aspect in italian BD patients and US evaluation is useful for the detection of this aspect </plain></SENT>
