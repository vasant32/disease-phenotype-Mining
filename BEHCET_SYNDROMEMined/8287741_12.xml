<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The postoperative course of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease was studied in nine patients who had undergone a total of 15 operations due to <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: These patients were followed up for an average of 6.0 years (range, 1 year, 3 months to 13 years, 10 months) after each operation and they were repeatedly examined by double-contrast radiography and/or colonofiberscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> was observed in 12 (80 percent) of the 15 surgical cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence (50 percent) of postoperative recurrence in six cases in which intraoperative endoscopy revealed no abnormality in the retained intestine was lower than that (100 percent) in nine cases without this examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent intestinal lesions in most cases were demonstrated as multiple aphthoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in the ileum near the ileocolectomy, or as one or two deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> at the ileocolectomy site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recurrent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were successfully treated by various medical therapies, but the effectiveness of these therapies was only temporary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the case of this disease, intraoperative endoscopy may be useful for preventing postoperative recurrence and periodic follow-up examination with radiography and endoscopy should be performed, even after surgery </plain></SENT>
