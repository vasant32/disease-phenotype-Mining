<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Duplex and color Doppler sonography was done in 21 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>��et's disease and ocular involvement and in 22 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty health volunteers also were examined as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery, posterior ciliary arteries, and ophthalmic artery were measured in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>��et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and ocular involvement, peak systolic velocities in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi>, posterior ciliary, and ophthalmic arteries were 7.3 +/- 2.3, 12.8 +/- 3.1, and 35.8 +/- 7.2 cm/sec, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but without ocular involvement, these values were 10.0 +/- 1.9, 17.3 +/- 3.4, and 33.5 +/- 4.0 cm/sec, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, the respective calculated values were 12.3 +/- 1.0, 16.5 +/- 1.6, and 35.8 +/- 4.4 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and posterior ciliary arteries, peak systolic and diastolic velocities were significantly lower in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and ocular involvement than in control subjects and patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but without ocular involvement (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic and diastolic velocities in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery were significantly lower in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but without ocular involvement than in the control group (p &lt; .001); however, no difference was observed for the posterior ciliary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow velocities in the ophthalmic artery were not significantly different among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that duplex and color Doppler sonography may be helpful in the diagnosis of ocular involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
