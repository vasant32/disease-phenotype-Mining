<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood leukocytes were harvested from healthy volunteers (n = 16) and ocular BD patients (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients consisted of 15 individuals in relapsing phase (6 with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment) and 20 individuals in remission phase (9 with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of CXC chemokine receptors (CXCRs) on leukocytes (including lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils) was measured using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment, CXCR2 expression (on both total leukocytes and neutrophils) in relapsing phase was significantly higher than in remission-phase patients or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, no significant difference was detected in the expression of CXCR1 between any ofthe groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, low-dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> therapy reduced CXCR2 expression on neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CXCR2 has a potential role in promot-ing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> during ocular attack and might also be a useful marker for disease activity </plain></SENT>
