<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 19 BD patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and/or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> associated with Hhcys (plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">hcy</z:chebi> &gt; 15 micromol/l) were prospectively included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 11 patients that received folic acide (15 mg/d) in addition to their previous standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 2 included 8 patients treated only with their previous standard treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks were assessed initially and monthly at each visit in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean Visual acuity and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks were evaluated quarterly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group 1, the mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15356">hcys</z:chebi> level was significantly lower after than before the treatment period (27.7 vs 13.1 micromol/l; p= 0.04) while it did not vary significantly in the same period in Group 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks was significantly lower after than before treatment at each quarter in groupl and mean visual acuity in this group increased from 4.33 to 5.44 decimals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the treatment period, the mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks, converted to frequency per 12 months were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During this period, the VA slightly increased in group 1 and decreased in group 2 but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folates</z:chebi> supplementation is useful for BD patients with Hhcys </plain></SENT>
