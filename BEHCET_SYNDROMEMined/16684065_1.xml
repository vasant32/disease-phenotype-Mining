<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> affects many systems and causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, and detection of an intracardiac mass in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patient should raise the question of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> operated for valvular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We operated three patients (one male and two females) who had been diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using mechanical bileaflet valves, aortic valve replacement in two and mitral valve replacement in the other patient were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mechanical valve replacement was performed using pledgetted-interrupted sutures in the mitral procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients' steroid therapies were not interrupted and in the postoperative course, steroid was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No reoperations were needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was instituted after the operation with the target of an international normalized ratio (INR) between 3 and 3.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no mortality either early or late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative and postoperative courses were uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Total follow-up was 23.3 patient/years with a mean of 93.3 +/- 64.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the late follow-up, patient with the mechanical mitral valve experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> 40 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Her echocardiographic examination gave a functional valve without any pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should remember the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patients and strict anticoagulation protocols should be utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the operations, bileaflet prostheses should be used </plain></SENT>
