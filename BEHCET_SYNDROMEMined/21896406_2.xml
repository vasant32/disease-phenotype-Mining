<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B phenotype frequencies were analyzed by serologic HLA class I typing and by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) reverse dot blot hybridization in 120 unrelated Moroccan patients: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom fulfilled the international study group criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and in 112 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides HLA-B*51 allele (20%), a significant increased frequency of the HLA-B*27 allele was found in Moroccans patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease when compared to controls (13.3% of patients versus 2.7% of controls, chi square = 8.75, OR = 5.59, 95% IC [1.58-19.75] and particularly in the patients who presented an <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> (25% vs. 5.5%, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
