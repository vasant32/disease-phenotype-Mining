<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several analyses of the neurological features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) have concluded that there are significant racial differences in its clinical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other series, however, failed to elicit such differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to describe in this retrospective survey the frequency, nature and relationship to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> of the neurological features in a cohort of BD patients of Caucasian origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched hospital records from nine District General or Regional Centre hospitals in south-west Great Britain and identified 22 individuals of Caucasian ethnic origin with neuro-BD, with a mean of 10 years follow-up per patient - the largest 'western' case series with the longest period of follow-up reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that presentation with neurological features was commoner in our patients (23%) than Middle Eastern series (3-10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> (27%) were likewise commoner (0-5%), as was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> (9% compared with 1-2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>parkinsonism</z:hpo>), which have only been rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of further clinical significance, we noted that non-neuropsychiatric features: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e>, intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> - were virtually always present or exacerbated during neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ethnicity--or conceivably environment--may play a significant role in the manifestation of neurological BD </plain></SENT>
