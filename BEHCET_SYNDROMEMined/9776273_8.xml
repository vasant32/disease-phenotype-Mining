<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to diagnose, however, because of the lack of effective imaging methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen BS patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms or signs [Neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>)] were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We combined two routine brain imaging modalities-brain SPECT with 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) and brain MRI-with clinical manifestations to diagnose brain involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi>-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT findings were abnormal in 100% (13/13) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI findings were abnormal in 31% (4/13) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gray matter was involved more commonly than white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the gray matter, the cerebral cortex was the most commonly involved area and the cerebellum was the least commonly involved area in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SPECT is a more sensitive and useful tool in detecting brain involvement in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> patients compared with brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of HMPAO and MRI is necessary to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in both gray and white matter in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
