<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) have an activated immune system, probably mediated by soluble factors in the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to examine the roles of plasma interleukin-2 (IL-2) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with BD diagnosed according to the Criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease and 20 age-matched healthy persons were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of cytokines were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of IL-2 and sIL-2R were increased in BD over controls, but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>sIL-2R levels in patients with active disease were significantly higher than in either patients with inactive disease (p &lt; 0.001) or the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the level of sIL-2R in BD seems to be related to disease activity </plain></SENT>
