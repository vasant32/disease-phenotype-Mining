<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty one BD patients were the subjects in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy adults were examined as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell surface antigens of lymphocytes were analysed with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant (p &lt; 0.01) difference in the proportion of CD4 positive cells with CD25 between BD patients with active uveoretinitis (27.6% (SD 8.4%)) and the controls (14.7% (2.3%)), but no significant difference in the proportion of CD4 or CD45RO positive cells with Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the proportion of CD8 positive cells with Fas was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in BD patients with active uveoretinitis (45.6% (11.6%)) than in those with inactive uveoretinitis (23.8% (8.1%)) or in the controls (24.4% (2.5%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD19 positive cells with Fas was also significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in BD patients with active uveoretinitis (13.0% (5.0%)) than in the controls (5.1% (2.1%)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The insufficient expression of Fas on activated CD4 positive T cells and its high expression on CD8 positive T cells seem to play an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
