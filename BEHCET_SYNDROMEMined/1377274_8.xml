<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD4+ cells was significantly lower in patients with BD (34 +/- 2%) than in control subjects (46 +/- 3%) (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among CD4+ cells, the percentage of suppressor-inducer (CD4+CD45RA+) cells was significantly lower in patients with BD (31 +/- 4%) than in control subjects (45 +/- 2%) (p less than 0.01), while the percentages of helper-inducer (CD4+CD29+) cells were similar in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD8+ cells was significantly higher in patients with BD (36 +/- 2%) than in control subjects (26 +/- 2%) (p less than 0.001) involving both CD45RA+ and CD29+ subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within CD4+ cells, the percentage of suppressor-inducer (CD4+CD45RA+) cells was significantly decreased in patients with active BD (26 +/- 3%) compared with control subjects (45 +/- 2%) (p less than 0.001), whereas in patients with inactive BD the difference was statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the defective suppressive function in patients with active BD may be related to the decreased suppressor-inducer subpopulation (CD4+CD45RA+) </plain></SENT>
