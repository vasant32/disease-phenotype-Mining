<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is known to be strongly associated with HLA-B 51, the association of HLA class I antigens with specific clinical findings of the disease has not been studied extensively and the few studies are conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association of HLA class I alleles with the manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Turkish patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were typed for HLA-A, B, and C antigens with the serologic, standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Possible associations of the HLA complex with clinical findings of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant findings are as follows (P &lt; 0.05): increased HLA-B 51 and decreased HLA-B35 frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, increased HLA-A29 and decreased HLA-Bw6 frequency in patients with ocular involvement, decreased HLA-Cw2 frequency in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, and decreased HLA-Cw 7 frequency in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of particular note, the results of this study suggest that the presence of HLA-B 51 and the absence of HLA-B35 can be regarded as laboratory risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
