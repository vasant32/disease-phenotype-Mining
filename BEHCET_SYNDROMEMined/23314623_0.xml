<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with recurrent BU attacks were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks and the mean score of extraocular manifestations by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease current activity form (BDCAF) during the 6 months before and the 6 and 12 months after initiation of infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The EuroQol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) were self-administered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before treatment and, 6 and 12 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' pre- and post-treatment EQ-5D and NEI VFQ-25 scores were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the 6- and 12-month follow-up, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks and the BDCAF scores was significantly decreased compared with the 6 months before starting infliximab (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fully completed questionnaires were received from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infliximab therapy was associated with a significant improvement of the EQ-5D (p&lt;0.0001), NEI VFQ-25 composite score (p=0.0001), general health score (p=0.0001) and mental health score (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This result shows a significant decrease in inflammatory activity of the disease and consequently improvement in HR-QoL and VR-QoL scores with a rising response pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks and extraocular manifestations by infliximab therapy significantly improved the HR-QoL and VR-QoL in patients with BU </plain></SENT>
