<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to survey self-rated oral health status, oral function, and oral health behaviour of patients with BD in eastern Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 33 BD patients and 101 healthy individuals ranging in age from 20 to 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survey was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The items of oral health in the questionnaire included subjective symptoms, self-rated dental problems and oral health behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that compared to the healthy subjects, BD patients experienced more severe physical limitations, mainly involving difficulty in pronouncing words (p &lt; 0.01) and the pain of oral mucosa and gingival tissue caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of oral health behaviour, BD patients did not behave positively with regard to maintaining oral health including regular tooth brushing despite relatively higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dental diseases</z:e> that they face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> due to BD induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dental disorder</z:e> such as the pain of gingiva, oral mucosa, and difficulty in the pronouncing of words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, their oral health behaviour is not positive compared to the healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the need to develop a more active pragramme for oral health education for patients with BD is indicated </plain></SENT>
