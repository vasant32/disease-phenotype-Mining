<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explored the impact of platelet-derived sCD40L on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD), an autoinflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also searched for influences by platelet matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) -2 and MMP-9, implicated in several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, on CD40L shedding from platelet membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet activation were studied by flow cytometry and aggregometry, surface expression of CD40L and platelet-leukocyte aggregates by flow cytometry, sCD40L by ELISA, cellular CD40L and CD40 levels by Western blot and MMPs activity by gelatin zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of sCD40L on MMP9 expression was studied in cultured MEG-01 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma and platelet-released sCD40L levels were higher in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in platelet activation and in platelet-leukocyte aggregates formation were observed between BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma and platelet MMP-9 levels were increased in BD patients, whereas there was no difference in platelet MMP-2 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since a correlation between plasma sCD40L and platelet MMP-9 activity was observed, we studied the influence of sCD40L on MMP-9 levels in the megakaryoblastic cell line MEG-01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment of MEG-01 cells with recombinant sCD40L increased MMP-9 but did not change MMP-2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, sCD40L release from platelets was mediated by MMP-9, and MMP-9 expression was in turn upregulated by sCD40L in the MEG-01 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that platelets and megakaryocytes might participate in a positive feedback loop occurring between sCD40L and MMP-9 which would contribute to the proinflammatory state observed in BD </plain></SENT>
