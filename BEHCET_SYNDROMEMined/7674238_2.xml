<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A stereomicroscope was applied to study the nutritional skin capillaries of the nailfolds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stages 0, A, B and C (Fagrell's classification) were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 40 healthy subjects capillary abnormalities (stage A) were detected in 7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 33 of our patients abnormal nailfold capillary findings (stages A, B, C) were noted in 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stage of capillary abnormalities was significantly correlated with skin manifestations (p = 0.03), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> (p = 0.04), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between stages 0 and A and eye involvement was not significant (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease duration was longer in patients of stage C than in stage 0 but this difference was also not significant (p &lt; 0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a noninvasive method we detected nailfold capillary abnormalities in the majority of our patients </plain></SENT>
