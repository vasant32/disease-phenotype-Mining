<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To characterize the histological features of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and simple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> syndrome and to clarify the possible mechanisms involved in their development by analysing the type of inflammatory infiltrates in the diseased intestine and the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules on endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue samples from 10 patients diagnosed as having intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> or simple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> syndrome were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue using a labelled streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> was remarkably seen in submucosal inflammatory lesions, but the adjacent arteries were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory infiltrates around the affected vessels consisted of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, and neutrophils predominated over CD68+ macrophages and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of mononuclear cells were CD3+ T cells, and CD4+ cells were more frequent than CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, but not vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, was expressed in most endothelial cells of the vessels with <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp>, some of which were also positive for HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neutrophilic <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> may be involved in the pathogenesis of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and simple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
