<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathologic features of eight autopsy cases of vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients' ages ranged from 31 to 56 years; there were five men and three women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, large vascular lesions were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (three cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> (one case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with arterial and venous occlusion (one case), and venous occlusion (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> were of the saccular or dissecting type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation most commonly occurred in the aorta (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> was seen in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>Aortitis</z:mp> was divided into active and scar stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one case with active stage <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp>, granulomatous <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we believe that the large arterial lesion in vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease represents <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> occurring in the media and adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the affected arteries, active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> occurs initially, followed by destruction of the media and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are probably produced by severe destruction of the media by intense active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The large venous lesions represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
