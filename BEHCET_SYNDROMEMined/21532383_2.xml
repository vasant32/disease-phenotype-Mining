<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Total 530 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were evaluated for the presence of neurologic involvement and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (10.2%) with neurological involvement, 36 (66.7%) had parenchymal and 16 (29%) had vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
