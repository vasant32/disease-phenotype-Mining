<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Myocardial involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease has been reported to be relatively rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate myocardial involvement noninvasively in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease by measuring signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG), QT dispersion and heart rate variability (HRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 28 eligible patients (16 male, mean age 37+/-13 years) of 33 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and 25 age- and sex-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The echocardiographic left ventricular measurements were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits and similar in both groups except the E/A ratio, which was significantly lower in patients with the disease than in control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minimal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001698'>pericardial effusion</z:hpo> was detected in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering the SAECG recordings, values of root mean square voltage in the last 40 ms were 30+/-18 microV and 38+/-18 microV in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and in the control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of cases with a value less than 20 microV was seven (25%) and one (4%) in the same groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both QT dispersion and the corrected QT interval dispersion were significantly increased in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared with the control patients (50.2+/-16.6 versus 20.4+/-18.8, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HRV measures appeared to be decreased in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group, only the standard deviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> filtered RR intervals in the entire 24 h ECG recordings and the percentage of differences between adjacent filtered RR intervals that are greater than 50 ms for the whole analysis values differed significantly between the groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in frequency domain parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the Holter ECG recording, grade 2 or greater premature ventricular complexes were observed in seven patients from the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group (25%) but in only one subject from the control group (4%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease appeared to have significantly increased QT dispersion, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1273070" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</z:e> pattern in echocardiography, a high incidence of positive late potentials and more complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004308'>ventricular arrhythmias</z:hpo>, suggesting myocardial involvement and the existence of an arrhythmogenic substrate, whereas the HRV measures do not suggest a clear autonomic abnormality in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
