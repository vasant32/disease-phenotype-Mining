<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (mean age +/- SD, 34.96 +/- 8.50) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers (hospital staff) as control subjects (mean age +/- SD, 34.45 +/- 9.16) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients were divided into two groups according to the number of criteria, complete (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four major criteria) and incomplete (three major criteria without ocular involvement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were compared with each other or controls regarding inner ear involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Audiometric pure-tone thresholds at 125 to 8000 Hz were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects in both groups, and pure tone average (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) hearing thresholds were calculated for the middle, high and low frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, short increment sensitivity index (SISI), tone decay and BERA examinations were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (SNHL) was present in six of 25 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients had unilateral total SNHL, two had bilateral moderate level SNHL, one had bilateral low-frequency SNHL and one bilateral high frequency SNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two, BERA, and in five SISI, examination disclosed inner ear involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control subjects, the past medical history was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and there was no consistent audio-vestibular complaint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> thresholds were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Otoscopic examination findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, with intact, mobile tympanic membranes in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that audio-vestibular involvement is not infrequent in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and it is under-estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients should regularly be followed by an otolaryngologists and be given information about the possibility of inner ear involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>According to our results, hearing loss occurs more often in older patients and also in the complete form of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
