<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have investigated the presence of bcl-2 protein in active <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and compared these results with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin samples of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) patients and BD unrelated leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Active <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of 23 Behçet's disease patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin samples of seven <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients, and archival biopsy specimens of 23 cutaneous leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were investigated for the presence of bcl-2 protein by immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of staining were assessed semiquantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expression of bcl-2 protein were demonstrated in 16 of 23 (69.5%) and 8 of 23 (34.7%) patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were statistically significant difference between two groups (x2 = 4.27, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin samples of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients showed bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression of bcl-2 protein may play a particular role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease by causing prolonged survival of infiltrating lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
