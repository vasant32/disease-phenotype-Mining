<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of TNF-alpha promoter polymorphisms at positions -308, -238 and -376 on the susceptibility, severity and clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha gene sequences from 107 patients with BD and 102 healthy subjects were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the TNF-alpha gene locus, which contains promoter polymorphisms at positions -376, -308, and -238, was performed with a DNA sequencing kit on automated sequencer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified according to disease severity and clinical features </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with BD the frequencies of TNF-alpha -308 (19.4% vs 18.4%), -238 (3.7% vs 5.9%), and -376 (0.9% vs 2.9%) gene polymorphisms were not found to be significantly different from those in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms did not show any association with disease severity or clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum TNF-alpha level was significantly higher in patients with BD than in healthy controls (3.10 +/- 1.45 pg/ml vs 2.43 +/- 1.94 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum TNF-alpha level was not found to be significantly associated with disease severity, activity, clinical findings and TNF-alpha genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that the TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms are unlikely to play an important role in the pathogenesis and severity of BD </plain></SENT>
