<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features, disease activity and therapy of the patients with ophthalmologic manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study symptoms and signs of the disease were analyzed both prospectively and retrospectively during the active manifestation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was reached according to the International Criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> (2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment effects were evaluated based on the presence of the best corrected visual acuity and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the vitreous humour before and after the application of our therapeutic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The applied therapeutic modality consisted of the primary application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy in the active stage of the disease complemented with the choice of drugs from the immunosuppressive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study there drugs were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A treatment refractory patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>poor vision</z:hpo> prognosis were treated with a third drug, the biological preparation infliximab, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of 11 patients with ophthalmologic manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> was 50.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA B-5 (51) was positive in 81% of the patients while 36% of the patients had positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in affected eyes included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e> (100%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> (45%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> (54%), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> (54%), and cystoid degeneration (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007906'>Increased intraocular pressure</z:hpo> was observed in 27% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant variation in disease activity parameters in any of the patients (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant improvement in visual acuity (p &lt; 0.05) and a high statistically significant decrease of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the worst affected eyes (p = 0.001) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our therapeutic method is useful for producing the optimal therapeutic plan for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>--<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of the difficult ophtamological manifestation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s desease as well as the prevention of relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However the high cost of the therapy and the potential complications should be taken into consideration when prescribing this therapy, especially a TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
