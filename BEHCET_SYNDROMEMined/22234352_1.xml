<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Infliximab, an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, administered to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) patients in Japan with refractory intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, has shown excellent clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some patients demonstrate a decreased response to infliximab during the course of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the correlation between this reduced therapeutic effect and elevation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>serum antinuclear antibody</z:hpo> (ANA) titers in patients with BD who were undergoing infliximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients (14 males and three females) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD who were undergoing treatment with infliximab for 2 years or longer were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their blood test results and clinical histories were obtained from medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient (5.9%) was ANA-positive prior to the initiation of infliximab, and 11 patients (64.7%) developed positive ANA during the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The appearance of ANA was observed 6 months after the initiation of the infliximab therapy, and its titers gradually increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (29.4%) have suffered from ocular inflammatory attacks since the sixth month from the initiation of infliximab treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were ANA-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, four patients (23.5%) who were ANA-negative experienced no ocular attacks during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the positive conversion and subsequent elevation of serum ANA titers in some patients with BD after the initiation of infliximab therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were shown only in the ANA-positive patients, serum ANA titer may be a helpful biomarker for predicting the recurrence of ocular attacks in BD patients treated with anti-TNF-α antibody therapies </plain></SENT>
