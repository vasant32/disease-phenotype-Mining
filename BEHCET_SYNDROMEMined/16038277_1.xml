<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and received surgery between April 1997 and August 2003 were retrospetively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, two patients had their aortic valves replaced in other hospital before admitted to our hospital where one undertook aortic valve replacement (AVR), and the other undertook aortic root replacement (ARR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In six patients who were initially treated in our hospital, the surgical procedures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> included AVR in three patients and ARR operation in other three patients in whom Bentall-type operation was conducted in two patients and Cabrol-type operation in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient died during hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up periods ranged from 3 months to 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five patients with prosthetic valve detachment or suture detachment, redo homograft replacement was required in one patient and redo AVR in 3, one patient had redo AVR twice, and the remaining one patient had no surgery at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients primarily operated by ARR operation have no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of prosthetic valve detachment is high in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ARR should be a first-line therapy for operation promised these patients </plain></SENT>
