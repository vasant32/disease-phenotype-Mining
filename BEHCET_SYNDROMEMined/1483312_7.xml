<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another five patients with non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> were also studied as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies, especially the IgM isotype, and IL-6 were highly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of both IgM isotype anticardiolipin antibodies and IL-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid dropped after disease activity subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increase in IgM isotype anticardiolipin antibodies and IL-6 in cerebrospinal fluid may be involved in the immune response of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of IgM isotype anticardiolipin antibodies and IL-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid may be useful in evaluating disease activity in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's </plain></SENT>
