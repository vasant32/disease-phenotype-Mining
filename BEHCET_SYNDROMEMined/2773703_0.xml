<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 37 patients, 74 family members and 49 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the frequencies of HLA-B51 were equally higher in the patients, fathers, mothers and siblings of the patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other contrary, the frequency of HLA-DQw1 was significantly decreased only in the patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results may suggest that family members of the patients have resistant genetic factors, unlike the patients </plain></SENT>
