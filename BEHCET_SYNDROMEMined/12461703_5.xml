<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome are characterized by a severe intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with a long course and recurrent episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated autoreactive lymphocytes are considered to be responsible for the development of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These lymphocytes may also be involved in the perpetuation and recurrence of this <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> if they do not properly go into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate this hypothesis, a study was carried out to evaluate the resistance of lymphocytes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in these two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 17 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e>, and 11 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells were isolated by centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque and cultured in RPMI 1640 with or without phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 9 h at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere with 5% CO( 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The obtained cells were incubated with anti-Fas antibody for 8 h at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere with 5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells were stained with annexin V/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> and finally subjected to flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly lower percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes after PHA stimulation was noted in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (19.7 +/- 4.1%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> (20.4 +/- 6.9%) than in controls (26.1 +/- 7.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes without PHA stimulation also tended to be lower in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (12.6%) and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> (12.8%) than in controls (14.6%), although the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lymphocytes in patients with either <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">VKH syndrome</z:e> are relatively resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mediated by anti-Fas antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-resistant, or long-lived, lymphocytes may be involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and recurrent intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> seen in these patients </plain></SENT>
