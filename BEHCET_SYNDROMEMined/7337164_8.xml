<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basic lesion is a lymphocytic and necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sized pulmonary arteries, veins and septal capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complications include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of elastic pulmonary arteries, arterial and venous thromboses, pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and bronchial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Striking periadventitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> develops and is believed to be related to repetitive vascular inflammatory insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peculiar newly formed collateral vessels, lacking elastic lamellae and derived from smooth muscle <z:mpath ids='MPATH_160'>metaplasia</z:mpath> around arterioles, are found in the periadventitial fibrous tissues around thrombosed arteries and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> of obscure origin, including those found in the Hughes-Stoven syndrome, are reviewed and both clinical and pathologic findings in these reports are found to be remarkably similar to those observed in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that such cases represent unrecognized or incomplete expressions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
