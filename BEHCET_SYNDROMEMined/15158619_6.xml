<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is more prevalent in Eastern Mediterranean countries and Japan where there is a linkage to HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mexican Mestizos are suitable subjects for studying the role of ethnicity in the susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution HLA class I and class II typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) reverse dot blot and PCR-single-strand polymorphism in 32 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 99 healthy ethnically-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increased frequency of HLA-B(*)44 (P = 0.02; OR = 2.78; CI 95% = 1.1-7.7), HLA-B(*)52 (P = 0.02; OR = 5.33; CI 95% = 1.07-29.1), and HLA-B(*)56 (P = 0.003; OR = 4.19; CI 95% = 3.37-5.21) as well as HLA-DRB1(*)01 and HLA-DRB1(*)13 (p = 0.007; OR = 3.36; CI 95% = 1.22-9.27) was found in Mexican patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The low frequency of native markers in Mexican Mestizo patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease suggests that genetic admixture between Eastern Mediterraneans and Orientals with Amerindians is a recent event that increased the risk of developing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the Mexican population </plain></SENT>
