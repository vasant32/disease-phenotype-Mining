<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 48-week open, self-controlled trial was conducted in 3 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the pretreatment phase of 16 weeks, 20 patients (8 men, 12 women; mean age 37 +/- 7 years SD) were treated with IFN-alpha 2b at a dose of 5 million units 3 times a week for 6 weeks followed by 5 million units once a week for 10 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subsequent 16 weeks not taking the medication was the posttreatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with IFN-alpha 2b significantly reduced the mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> attacks (F = 3.48; p &lt; 0.05), their mean duration (F = 3.77; p &lt; 0.05), and the mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (F = 6.66; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of mucocutaneous lesions also showed a decrease, but this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Except for the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, the mean number and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptoms tended to return to pretreatment levels in the posttreatment phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that systemic IFN may be effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
