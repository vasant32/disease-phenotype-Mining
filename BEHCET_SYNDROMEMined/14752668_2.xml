<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine female patients aged 19-54 yrs and 20 healthy females aged 19-50 yrs (control group) were accepted into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRCT images were taken and according to HRCT patients were divided into HRCT (+) and HRCT (-) groups (18 patients in each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests (PFT) through a spirometer were performed and FVC, FEV(1), FEF(25-75%), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="55310">PEF</z:chebi>, VC, RV, FRC, DLCO and DLCO/VA were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was observed when the PFT values were compared between HRCT (+) and HRCT (-) patients for the obtained results and the percentage of the expected values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the PFT values were compared for both HRCT (+) and HRCT (-) patients with the control group separately there was no statistical difference between the best values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistically low DLCO/VA value was observed between the percentage of the expected values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that though there is a pulmonary restriction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, this restriction has no relation to pulmonary functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It would be useful to perform pulmonary function tests in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> both with or without any pathological findings in HRCT for obtaining information about pulmonary functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that even when the results of the pulmonary function tests are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, considering some pathological changes in HRCT, HRCT investigations may be useful for following up the disease </plain></SENT>
