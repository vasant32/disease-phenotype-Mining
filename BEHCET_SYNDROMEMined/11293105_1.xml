<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Brainstem is the most frequently affected structure in neurobehçet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been employed in early diagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present here a case of neurobehçet disease which brainstem lesion was suspected by blink reflex and corroborated by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAER were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: The patient was a woman, 49 years old, diagnosed from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms consisted of dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in the previous days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination showed increased tendon reflexes and adiadochokinesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid was inflammatory but aseptic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computerised tomography and BAER were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blink reflex recording showed abnormalities after the stimulation of the right supraorbital nerve in R2 component, ipsilateral and contralateral, the remainder components being <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding was compatible with a lesion in the spinal tract-nucleus of the right trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cranial MRI showed several areas of high signal intensity in protuberancial calotte and spinal tract-nucleus of the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient improved after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> combined therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serial blink reflex studies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while the patient was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that determination of blink reflex together with BAER may be of help in the evaluation of a more extensive area of the brainstem in neurobehçet's disease, even in absence of trigemino-facial symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is important because of neurobehçet's morbi-mortality </plain></SENT>
