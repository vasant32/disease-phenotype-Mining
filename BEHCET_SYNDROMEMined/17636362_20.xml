<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was made of 37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were divided into three groups: one group (N = 16) received immunosuppressive therapy alone, another group (N = 17) received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> and anticoagulation combination therapy, and the third group (N = 4) received anticoagulation therapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory parameters and the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in BD appeared to have a more diffuse pattern than idiopathic type and a predilection for lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most commonly involved sites were the superficial and common femoral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred in two cases in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> group (12.5%), one case in the combination therapy group (5.9%), and three cases in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> group (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between recurrence in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> and combination therapy groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> phase reactants were elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that immunosuppressive therapy is essential and that anticoagulation therapy might not be required for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> associated with BD </plain></SENT>
