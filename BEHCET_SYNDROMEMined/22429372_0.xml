<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The global function of both left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) functions were compared in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) versus healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Biventricular function was evaluated by measurement of the myocardial performance index (MPI) evaluated from tissue Doppler echocardiographic measurements in 24 BD patients and was compared with measurements in 24 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher MPI values were associated with ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrated impaired RV function in patients with BD compared with healthy controls, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LV function was observed both in patients with BD and in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early noninvasive evaluation of the properties of BD during the asymptomatic phase of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> may have prognostic value in the management of patients </plain></SENT>
