<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (PR) has been accepted as one of the major criteria in this disease, there is a lack of a standardized method to measure PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate results of PR in different body areas and the effect on the positive rate of PR of application of numerous needle pricks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test was performed using simultaneous 16 needle pricks with 20G disposable needles on different body areas of 56 patients with BD, 49 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) and 17 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No positive PR was found in healthy controls, but was observed in nine patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (18.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was detected in 48 of 56 patients with BD, a positive rate of 85.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The site most frequently positive for PR was the forearm, while the least frequent was the abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple needle pricks could play an important role in increasing the positive rate of PR in BD, and it may be important in the investigation of aetiological factors in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
