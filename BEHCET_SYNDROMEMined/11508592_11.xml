<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution of the MHC class I chain related gene A transmembrane (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM) alleles in Italian patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), and to investigate the relative contribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> alleles and HLA-B51 in the susceptibility and specific clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 69 consecutive Italian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD were followed at rheumatology, ophthalmology, and neurology units during a 3 year period (1997-99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected 130 healthy subjects from the same geographic areas as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and controls were examined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> microsatellite polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serological HLA class B51 typing was performed by a standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A strong association with HLA-B51 was observed in patients with BD (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.8-11.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM allele A6, in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51, was only slightly increased in patients compared to controls (60.9% vs 50.8%; p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant associations between HLA-B51 or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM alleles and clinical subgroups, particularly central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system or eye involvement, were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HLA-B51 is the most important susceptibility gene in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6, when it exists, is secondary to the strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
