<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and bilateral eye involvement were treated for periods of between 30 and 38 months with low doses (5 mg/kg/day) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients who responded well, this dose was reduced to a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a good response to treatment in 86% of patients, with complete disappearance of ocular attacks in 43% and a reduction in frequency and severity of attacks in a further 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient suffered a deterioration in visual acuity (0.2 in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>) during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other patients (93%) either remained the same or improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attacks of buccal and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulceration</z:e> were also less severe and less frequent during treatment with CyA, although they were proportionally more frequent than ocular attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main side effects were a dose-dependent and reversible biochemical renal toxicity in 28% of patients, gingival <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in 14% of patients, and systemic arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001007'>Hirsutism</z:hpo> was observed in 100% of the female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that low doses of CyA administered over a long period of time constitute an effective therapeutic alternative that helps prevent evolution towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, although it has the disadvantage as compared with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> that it does not inactivate the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anti-inflammatory effect is therefore dose-dependent and persists only for as long as the drug is being administered </plain></SENT>
