<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated clinical features, aetiology, prospective follow-up results and also factors favouring secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN) in patients with EN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 50 patients (mean age 38 y) with a diagnosis of EN between 1993 and 2002 in our clinic were included in the study prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A biopsy was performed in 30 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to have secondary EN when an underlying condition was found, and to have primary (or idiopathic) EN when no such condition was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the diagnosis of the underlying diseases, diagnostic criteria and/or diagnostic methods were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Categorical variables were compared by using chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients were female (6F/1M) and 54% of cases had a determined aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The foremost aetiology was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152545" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary tuberculosis</z:e> (18%) followed in decreasing order by a poststreptococcal (16%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (12%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel diseases</z:e> (IBD) (4%), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (2%), and pregnancy (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were followed for a mean duration of 7 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nodosities relapsed every y in 74% of idiopathic EN patients but in only 1 (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease) of the secondary ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors favouring secondary EN were as follows: prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, cough, sore throat, not relapsing EN, abnormal chest X-ray, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of higher than 50 mm/h and a CRP value of higher than 6 times the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had bed rest and the majority was given naproxen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were usually favourable within 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The patients with an underlying disease were given specific treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>EN has been associated with numerous diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce cost and duration of diagnosis, every centre should determine its own most frequent aetiological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Factors favouring secondary EN should also be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152545" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary tuberculosis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal pharyngitis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, IBD, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome as the main aetiologies of EN </plain></SENT>
