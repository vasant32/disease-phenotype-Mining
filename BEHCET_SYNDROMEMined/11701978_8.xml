<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until today, the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> and the real incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> in this disease have not been clarified yet </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with BD and 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> plaque-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> who made up the control group were examined by the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (BDI), Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> (BAI) and Brief Symptom Inventories (BSI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean BDI score of the BD group was 11.69 +/- 6.93, and the corresponding value was 9.11 +/- 7.34 for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean BAI score of the BD group was 21.39 + 13.68 and this level was 12.41 +/- 10.70 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
