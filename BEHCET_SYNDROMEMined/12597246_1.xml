<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte GSH level, G-Px and G-Red activities were found to be lower, SOD activity was found to be higher in the patients as compared the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between patients and controls for GST activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlations between GSH and G-Px, GSH and G-Red; significant negative correlations between GSH and SOD, G-Px and SOD, G-Red and SOD were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that erythrocyte SOD activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> system are altered in men with new diagnosed BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that these alterations may be a contributory factor for tissue damage associated with BD </plain></SENT>
