<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> are more common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to define and characterize the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), a form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> not previously related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients, also suffering from BD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-BD), were recruited from about 4,000 patients registered in our clinic, using a computer survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients identified by the screening process were examined, and those meeting the published criteria for the diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and BD were classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-BD cases and compared with unselected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and BD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of BD was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> than in populations known to be rich in BD (eg, 16 per 4,000 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> compared with 1 per 104 in Japan, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-BD cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> or BD controls were comparable in most demographic, clinical, and laboratory aspects studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, more cases than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-controls were of Iraqi/Turkish origin and responded less favorably to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of cases than BD controls had skin, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, and gastrointestinal manifestations, originated from North Africa, and had family history of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most cases, as in most respective controls, the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> was of intermediate grade and the extensiveness of BD was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The HLA B5 antigen was present in 53% of BD cases and 40% of BD controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BD should be included among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> complicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-BD, and in patients suffering from each of these entities alone, are clinically and demographically comparable </plain></SENT>
