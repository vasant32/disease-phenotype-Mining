<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: HLA typing was performed in 67 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease from Andalucia, Spain to: 1) analyze the association of class I and II molecules with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Spain; 2) study the clinical correlations and 3) evaluate its diagnostic and/or prognostic role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1) Serologic typing (microlymphocytotoxicity): class I molecules in 67 patients and class II molecules in 47 patients (controls: 223 healthy volunteers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2) Oligotyping (PCR-SSO): class II molecules (DQB1 and generic DRB1) in 47 patients and 189 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3) Statistical analysis: chi square test (dicotomic variables) and Student t test (continuous variables), and calculation of the relative risk by the Wolff and Haldane formulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HLA B51 antigen was the most frequently observed in the whole series (p = 0.003) in males with ocular disease (p = 0.0001) and in patients with cutaneous (p = 0.001) and digestive involvement (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HLA B51-positive males were younger at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.01) with neurologic involvement being infrequent (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HLA B51 antigen was associated with neurologic (p = 0.06) and articular involvement (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DQB1*0303 was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> of bad evolution (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The DR11 and DQB1*0301 were more frequent in HLA B51-positive patients and the DQ5 was negatively associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, particularly in the HLA B51-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study of the HLA antigens provides useful information for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in differentiating the different clinical forms and has prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
