<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 1 month of therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but one demonstrated a rapid decrease of the intraocular inflammatory processes along with an arrest of the deterioration of vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 1 year (or more) of treatment, most patients still show the same visual acuity achieved after 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 3-year span of this study, attempts at tapering off the CsA dosage to less than 5 mg/kg/d induced a temporary flare-up in 20 of the 24 patients followed without interruption for more than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, control of the intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was finally achieved by 5 mg CsA/kg/d or less in 14 of the 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In six of these 14 patients the CsA dosage was further tapered to total discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the six patients showed a rapid reactivation of the intraocular inflammatory processes with a profound decrease in vision within 1 and 3 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In four patients, control of the intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and preservation of good visual acuity have been observed for a period of up to 18 months </plain></SENT>
