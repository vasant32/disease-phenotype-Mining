<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> alone is not sufficient to explain the pathogenesis of BD, and some evidence suggests that immunologic abnormalities are also important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the possible role of immune regulation in the development of BD-like symptoms induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus inoculation in ICR mice, macrophages were deleted by use of liposome-encapsulated clodronate (lip-Cl(2)MDP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with lip-Cl(2)MDP suppressed the development of BD-like symptoms, and this suppression was correlated with the induction of interleukin-4 expression in mouse spleens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the Th2 adjuvant ovalbumin (OVA)-alum was injected into mice with BD-like symptoms, their cutaneous symptoms improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adoptive transfer with splenocytes from OVA-alum-injected mice also resulted in improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that up-regulated Th2 cytokine expression can attenuate the development of and improve some BD-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
