<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To measure central corneal thickness (CCT) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), particularly in the active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured CCT by ultrasound pachymetry in 64 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and in 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one of the patients with BD had ocular involvement and 23 none; 19 of the 41 with ocular involvement were in an active period and 22 had inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CCT in the group with active ocular involvement was significantly higher (589+/-27 microm) than in the control group (553+/-21 microm) (p = 0.003), the group with inactive ocular involvement (560+/-26 microm) (p &lt; 0.001), and the group with no ocular involvement (558+/-25 microm) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After appropriate treatment of patients with active ocular involvement, the mean CCT returned nearly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (563+/-20 microm) and the difference from controls was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference for the mean CCT between controls and the patients with no ocular involvement or with inactive ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with active ocular involvement have a thicker CCT than patients with inactive ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in CCT between controls and patients with no ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CCT of patients with active ocular involvement returned to nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCT must be taken into account when developing a managing and following approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients with active ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
