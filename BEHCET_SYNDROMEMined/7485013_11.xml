<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to identify the underlying disorder responsible for portal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and cavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with this finding underwent a thorough medical examination with intent to determine the cause and biochemical consequences of CTPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During an 8-yr period, a total of 1247 patients with clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> were examined using ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty four of these 1247 patients were found to have CTPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case, the finding of CTPV was confirmed by portography using either splenoportography or arterial portography, with digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 44 patients were studied in an effort to determine the etiology of the cavernous transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the specific reason for the increased serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and alkaline phosphatase levels in 35 of the 44 cases was evaluated by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (34 patients), percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (one patient), and by CT in 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The surgical findings in 10 of these 44 patients, who ultimately underwent splenectomy and portal venous decompression for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, were reviewed in light of the ultrasonographic, portographic, and ERCP findings in the same 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The underlying disorder responsible for cavernous transformation was found to be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in seven patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in four, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002612'>congenital hepatic fibrosis</z:hpo> in five, congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> in one, and a prior abdominal operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite a full clinical, radiological, hematological, and chemical evaluation, no etiology for CTPV was found in the remaining 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these later cases had no indication for liver biopsy or evidence for parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these 26 patients, the serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and alkaline phosphatase ranged from mild to moderately increased compared with the moderately to markedly increased levels present in the 18 patients having an identifiable underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Irregular, undulating narrowing and nodular extrinsic defects, the so-called "pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> sign" was present in 33 of the 35 patients who underwent either ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No such findings were observed in 10 control cirrhotic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> but without CTPV, who also underwent ERCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that mildly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003155'>increased serum alkaline phosphatase</z:hpo> and direct reacting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels occur in cases with CTPV associated with a pseudo-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_354'>cholangiocarcinoma</z:mpath> sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Presumably, these enzyme elevations are a result of compression of the biliary tree by the venous collaterals that run along the extrahepatic biliary tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>None of the 33 cases with this sign had cholangiolar <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, when a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> but without documentable parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> demonstrates an increase in the serum direct reacting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and alkaline phosphatase levels, CTPV and the presence of large extrahepatic venous collaterals partially obstructing the biliary tree should be suspected </plain></SENT>
