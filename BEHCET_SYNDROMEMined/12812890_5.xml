<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case series of eight patients reporting to a tertiary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with typical features of the disease are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of the eight patients were tested and found to be HLA-B51 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease has only been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case reports in the indigenous west African and Afro-Caribbean populations, in whom the incidence of HLA B51 is also very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A series of patients from the London region presented with the typical symptoms and signs of disease, most of whom were also HLA B51 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of disease in this population, when absent in the indigenous population, suggests either that ascertainment of disease is poor in the indigenous population or that acquired factors may be important in the aetiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
