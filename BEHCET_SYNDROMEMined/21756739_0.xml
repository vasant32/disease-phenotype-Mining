<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2007 to January 2009, thirty patients (male 16, female 14) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet Disease</z:e> who got treatment at Beijing Tongren Hospital were collected, whose age range was 21 - 45 years old and the average age was 35 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of International <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> Study Group, and the other system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> were ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None the patients did receive any anti-inflammatory treatment before getting treatment in the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty health controls (male 15, female 15) were collected in Beijing Tongren Hospital Physical Examination Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was on significant difference in age and gender composition between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood and sera were obtained from 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the subsets of Th cells in peripheral blood was detected by automatic flow cytometer and the IL-17, IL-23, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β1 in sera was detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-test of independent sampler was used to analysis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the scores of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> had significant higher percentages of Th1 (25.08% ± 7.23%) and Th17 (36.38% ± 17.47%) (t = -1.43, -2.187; P &lt; 0.05) cells and lower percentages of T regulatory cells (Tregs) (4.11% ± 1.32%) (t = 3.70, P &lt; 0.05), and the Th1/Th2 (13.34 ± 2.66) (t = -1.41, P &lt; 0.05) and Th17/Tregs (9.52 ± 5.82) (t = -2.218, P &lt; 0.05) ratio was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No differences in the percentages of Th2 cells between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> revealed significant increase in peripheral Th17 related cytokines [IL-17 (13.21 ± 4.20) ng/L, IL-6 (6.37 ± 6.51) ng/L, TGF-β1 (4477.20 ± 2146.60) ng/L, IL-23 (10.86 ± 7.86) ng/L] levels (t = -3.61, -2.33, -2.15 and -3.18; P &lt; 0.05) and obvious decrease in Tregs related cytokines [IL-10 (6.27 ± 5.56) ng/L] (t = 5.95, P &lt; 0.05), compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There are obvious changes in the number of Th17 and Tregs and their related cytokines during the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, so it can be inferred that Th17 and Tregs probably have some effects on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
