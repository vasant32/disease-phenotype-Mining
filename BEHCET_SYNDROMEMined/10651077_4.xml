<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various immune abnormalities have previously been shown in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated T lymphocyte subsets associated with cytotoxic activity and natural killer (NK) cells by flow cytometry in 37 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 38 healthy controls, and 17 diseased control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the healthy controls, CD4+CD16+ and CD4+CD56+ subsets were found to be higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease group as well as in the disease control group (CD4+CD16+: BD = 5 +/- 3, DC = 14 +/- 14, HC = 3 +/- 2, P = 0.001; CD4+CD56+: BD = 11 +/- 5, DC = 18 +/- 17, HC = 8 +/- 6, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
