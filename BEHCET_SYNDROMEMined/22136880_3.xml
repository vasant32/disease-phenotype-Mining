<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective series of 40 severe Neurobehçet cases fulfilling the International Study Group criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were consecutively recruited over a period from June 2004 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had clinical and ophthalmologic examinations; they underwent laboratory and imaging investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> as initial bolus of 600 mg/m(2) of BSA in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th day followed by a bolus of 600 mg/m(2) BSA every 2 months for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic therapy was given to patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient follow-up and tolerance to treatment were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average age at diagnosis was 34±13 years, with a sex-ratio of 1.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation was dominated by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> in 48.8% of cases, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in 43.6% of cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> in 7.7% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 40 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> bolus, despite two aggravated cases, evolved positively with clinical improvement and good tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The demographic and clinical aspects of our series are similar to those reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previously reported cases of a poor prognosis in severe neurobehçet's disease, our study suggests that immediate and aggressive treatment by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> may ameliorate the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a multicenter study is needed to confirm the possible efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and further assess the long-term tolerance </plain></SENT>
