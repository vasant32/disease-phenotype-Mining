<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interleukin 8 (IL-8) has recently been under focused investigation because of its possible participation in the evolution of Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The reliability of IL-8 as a serological marker for the activity of the disease was investigated in a prospective consecutive trial of 34 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The activity of the disease was clinically evaluated by the number of actively involved organ systems registered on the day of blood sampling and by the presence of oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-8 levels were compared to C-reactive protein (CRP) values and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An association of IL-8 levels with the activity of the disease was detected when compared with both the number of active clinical signs (p = 0.024) and the presence of oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no association of CRP and sedimentation rate with the activity of the disease could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A weak correlation of IL-8 levels with sedimentation rate values at 2 h was found (R = 0.37, p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results confirm previous data concerning the significance of IL-8 and, in addition, they provide first evidence for the reliability of IL-8 as a serological marker for assessment of the activity of Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the follow-up of clinical and therapeutic studies </plain></SENT>
