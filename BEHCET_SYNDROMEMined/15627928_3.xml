<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: clinical data of 17 patients (33 eyes) were retrospectively reviewed from May 1996 to May 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male/female ratio was 12/5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The commonest manifestations were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> (100%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (88%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>Anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was present in 59%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> was in 76% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> was in 88.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved in 11 (33.3%) eyes, remind stable in 18 (54.5%) eyes and four (12.1%) eyes lost two or more lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main drug therapy consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (59%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had received three drugs simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BD can lead to an irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>; however, the visual prognosis is good (85%) if immunosuppressor treatment is implemented </plain></SENT>
