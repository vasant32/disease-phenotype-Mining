<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory findings, as well as treatment options and prognosis of four BD patients with BCS, were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four male patients with BCS due to BD, ranging in age from 22 to 46 (median 24 years), were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of BCS was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography and/or venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, anticardiolipin antibodies and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of BCS and both 6 months and 1 year after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance and prothrombin gene mutation were also determined in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of the four patients with BCS had already been diagnosed with BD, while the other two were diagnosed with concurrent BD and BCS upon their admission to our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and superficial migratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> prior to development of BCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Case 1 died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> 1 month after his admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall health state of the other three patients has remained good thanks to anticoagulation and immunosuppressive treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients had one or more than one factor predisposing to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of occluded hepatic veins and right hepatic vein involvement, as well as inferior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, can be deemed as a major determinant of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of a thrombophilic condition may not be a factor for the clinical prognosis of BCS on its own, it may still necessitate a long-term anticoagulation for prevention of further thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
