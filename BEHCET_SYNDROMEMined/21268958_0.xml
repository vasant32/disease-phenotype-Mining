<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial involvement is uncommon but associated with important morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical course of BD with severe pulmonary artery involvement in a 19-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He presented with massive haemoptysis related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial treatment consisted in urgent right inferior lobectomy, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and monthly intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, he developed pulmonary artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at non-aneurysmatic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy was intensified, monthly intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was continued and an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> was added to the treatment with a favourable clinical and radiological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case illustrates that timely initiation of highly potent immunosuppressive therapy is critical to obtain a favourable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At present, a consensus regarding optimal management of vascular BD is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ALthough anticoagulation is not generally recommended, our report encourages a patient-based decision after carefully tailoring potential risks and benefits </plain></SENT>
