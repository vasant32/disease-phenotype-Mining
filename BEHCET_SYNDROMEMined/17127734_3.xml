<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADMA is involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> and its level in BD is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to evaluate the relationship between ADMA and NO levels in plasma of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 3 groups of 30 subjects: (a) controls, (b) BD patients with mucocutaneous involvement, and (c) BD patients with vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma NO levels were assayed by spectrophotometry and plasma ADMA levels were assayed by an ELISA test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma ADMA levels were higher in both groups of BD patients than in the controls; the ADMA levels were higher in the BD patients with vascular involvement than in the mucocutaneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma NO levels were lower in both groups of BD patients than in controls; plasma NO levels were lower in the BD patients with vascular involvement than in mucocutaneous group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the combined groups of 60 BD patients, there was significant inverse correlation between the plasma concentrations of ADMA and NO (r = -0.570, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles did not differ significantly between the BD patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results are evidence for increased plasma ADMA levels and decreased plasma NO levels as risk factors for cardiovascular events in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of NO synthesis by ADMA may contribute to vascular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
