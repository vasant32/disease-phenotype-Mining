<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also studied 29 patients with non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of CSF beta(2)MG, serum beta(2)MG, Q albumin (an indicator of blood-brain barrier function), and CSF beta(2)MG index (an indicator of intrathecal beta(2)MG synthesis) were significantly elevated in patients with NB compared with the control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in these parameters between 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NB and six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine patients with NB, CSF beta(2)MG and Q albumin were significantly decreased when the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> manifestations were improved by successful treatment, whereas CSF beta(2)MG index and serum beta(2)MG were not significantly changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the elevation of CSF beta(2)MG, which results from the transudation of serum beta(2)MG as well as the increased intrathecal synthesis presumably by infiltrating lymphocytes, is a good marker of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease activity of NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data, however, also suggest that the intrathecal synthesis of beta(2)MG might not parallel to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease activity of NB, most likely due to the recovery of constitutive physiological intrathecal synthesis of beta(2)MG in spite of the withdrawal of pathological beta(2)MG synthesis at times of treatment-associated improvement </plain></SENT>
