<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurs in about 25% of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) is another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e>, which stems from mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> gene (MEFV) and shares a number of features with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: MEFV analysis in patients with BD suggests that mutated MEFV may act as a susceptibility gene in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the rate and the clinical correlates of MEFV mutations in Israeli BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Included were 54 BD patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BD patients were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme analysis for the three most common MEFV mutations (M694V, V726A, and E148Q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between BD manifestations and MEFV alleles was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one BD patients were found to carry a single MEFV mutation and three additional patients were compound heterozygotes, a frequency significantly higher than that expected for ethnically matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between carriers and non-carriers with respect to gender, frequency of HLA B5 antigen, cutaneous lesions, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint disease</z:e>, and severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, carriers did experience <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> more often [54% vs. 17%, p&lt;0.005, odds ratio (OR) = 6.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-26.9] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> less often (20% vs. 40%, p&lt;0.05, OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.04-0.92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MEFV appears to be a susceptibility and modifier gene in BD </plain></SENT>
