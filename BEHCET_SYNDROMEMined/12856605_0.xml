<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The EHF-98B MMW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RL compound therapy apparatus made in the University of Electronic Technology(Chengdu) was used in 171 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The superficial, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> or the visceral reflected skin regions (acupoints) were directly exposed to the light from the apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases were divided into five groups, namely skin mucosa superficial lesions, trauma of the bone and joint soft tissue, surgical incision, ENT <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and rare intricate diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effects observed in the groups were analyzed and evaluated by means of 4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for the 171 patients, the cure rate was 42.7% (73 patients), the effective rate 25.1%(43 patients), the improvement rate 31%(53 patients), and no effect constituted 1.2%(2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total effective rate was 98.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This therapy was especially effective for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009228'>cervicitis</z:mp>, cervical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath>, soft tissue trauma, surgical incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also it was effective for treating some rare intricate diseases, e.g. <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterility</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>So the millimeter wave and magnetism light compound therapy may find wide clinical applications </plain></SENT>
