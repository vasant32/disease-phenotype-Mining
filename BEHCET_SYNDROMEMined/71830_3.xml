<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The controls were 50 subjects randomly chosen from a local population and 24 apparently healthy subjects of the same ethnic groupings as those of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study revealed significant differences in the frequencies of various antigens in the above three groups, the most obvious of them related to HLA-B5 and HLA-Bw35, HLA-B5 was demonstrated in 71% of the patients as compared with 18% in the local population group and 12.5% in the ethnically related healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidences of HLA-Bw35 were 66.7%, 32% and 37.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 86% of the patients, at least one of these two antigens was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that besides contributing to the understanding of the disease process, the determining of associated specific antigens may constitute a further diagnostic acid in doubtful cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
