<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nonrandomized, retrospective comparative clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four major criteria were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (Group 1) were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> for a minimum period of three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (Group 2) who failed to respond to conventional therapy were given infliximab at a dose of 5 mg/kg in a single intravenous infusion on day 1 and every two weeks for a total of six doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were given the same treatment during each subsequent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were the number of relapses, visual outcome, and ocular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 36 months in Group 1 and 30 months in Group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of relapses was significantly reduced and the duration of remission was longer in the infliximab therapy group compared to conventional therapy group (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity at 24 months follow-up was significantly better in patients treated with infliximab (Group 2) when compared to conventional therapy (Group 1) (P = .0059) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease had significant decrease in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, improvement of visual acuity, and reduced ocular complications following infliximab when compared to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of relapses was less in the infliximab treatment group than the conventional therapy group </plain></SENT>
