<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e>, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> are the three main manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiopathogenesis of BD is still obscure, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) is one of the possible causal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various kinds of drugs, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2453">aciclovir</z:chebi> have been used in treatment, but effectiveness is variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the efficacy of famciclovir, an antiviral compound that acts against HSV, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740380" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella-zoster</z:e> virus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus, in a murine model of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the HSV-induced BD mouse model, famciclovir was administered variously before and after inoculation or from the day of lesion occurrence, with appropriate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ulceration of the mouth and genital skin and eye involvement were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, spleen cytokine expression was measured by polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pretreatment and concurrent treatment did not affect the occurrence of BD, but treatment from the appearance of lesions was effective in improving BD and preventing recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After famciclovir, interleukin 2 expression correlated with the recurrence of BD symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests the possible role of immune response to <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the development and activation of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study provides a rationale for clinical trials of famciclovir in the human form of BD </plain></SENT>
