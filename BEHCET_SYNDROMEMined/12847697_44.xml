<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify and recombine a protein of the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell (HDMEC) that specifically reacts with anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA) in the serum of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), and to evaluate the usefulness of this protein in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The proteomics technique, with 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, was used to identify and recombine HDMEC antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of recombinant protein isolated by gene cloning were performed on serum from healthy controls, patients with BD, and patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen of 40 BD patients had serum IgM antibody to HDMEC antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purified protein that reacted with AECA in BD patient sera was found to be alpha-enolase by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant alpha-enolase protein was isolated and refined by gene cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On Western blots, AECA-positive IgM from the sera of patients with active BD reacted strongly with recombinant human alpha-enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BD patient sera positive for anti-alpha-enolase did not react with human gamma-enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On dot-blotting, reactivity to human alpha-enolase was detected only in the IgM-positive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 18 AECA-positive sera that were positive for the HDMEC antigen showed reactivity to recombinant alpha-enolase IgM antibody by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The alpha-enolase protein is the target protein of serum AECA in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the presence of IgM antibodies to alpha-enolase in endothelial cells from the serum of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although further studies relating this protein to the pathogenesis of BD will be necessary, alpha-enolase and its antibody may prove useful in the development of new diagnostic and treatment modalities in BD </plain></SENT>
