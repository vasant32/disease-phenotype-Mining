<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Besides routine clinical and laboratory investigations, several lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function tests were performed in 10 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (1 of Turkish and 9 of German descent, 5 of them male and 5 female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No true abnormality could be detected in both number of T- and B-cells as well as in T-cell response to PHA-stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was a significant enhancement of microphage migration and chemotaxis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of our patients compared with a large control group of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The very same investigations carried out in 10 patients suffering from benign recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> (most of them of Mikulicz's type) showed no difference to our controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, there was no increase of chemotactic microphage function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, assessment of microphage chemotaxis has become an important investigative procedure for in-vitro testing of atypical or low-grade manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis indeed give some explanation of non-specific cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> as a phenomenon and, no doubt, should be superior in diagnostic reliability as abnormal chemotaxis can even be detected in patients suffering from faint relapses of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
