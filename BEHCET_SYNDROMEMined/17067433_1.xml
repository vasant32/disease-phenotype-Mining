<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that lactobacilli, having anti-inflammatory activity, may be useful in some diseases, particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to study the efficacy of lactobacilli lozenges (INERSAN, VSL Pharmaceuticals, USA) in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients were studied before, during and after lactobacillus use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had mainly skin-mucosa involvement with fresh <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and none were using systemic immunosuppressives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients chewed on 6 lozenges/day at intervals of 2-3 hours during the time they were awake for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of OU before visit 1 and after 1. and 2. weeks after drug use was the main outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty three patients completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1 patient left the trial the second day because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and another was a no show at the 2.visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in the mean number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> following treatment, more pronounced among the females, and this decrease continued at least for 1 week after the treatment was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4/23 patients had side effects with 3 complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and 1 of abdominal fullness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot and open study Lactobacillus brevis CD2 lozenges seemed to be effective in controlling the OU of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Randomized, controlled trials with this seemingly innocuous agent are now needed </plain></SENT>
