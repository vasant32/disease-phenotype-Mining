<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T lymphocyte populations were stimulated with T cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> or with streptococcal preparations, the supernatants from these cultures potentiated neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis and <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon gel-filtration of these stimulated lymphocyte supernatants, the neutrophil-potentiating activity was inactivated by trypsin or by a 30-min incubation at 130 degrees C, but was not affected by acid treatment at pH 2 or heat treatment at 56 degrees C for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its activity was almost not affected by antisera against human interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interferon-gamma or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the stimulation of T cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, the supernatants released from the lymphocytes of not only the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but also healthy and diseased controls enhanced neutrophil functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, supernatants from streptococcal preparation-stimulated lymphocytes from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had a higher potentiating effect on neutrophil functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that the enhanced neutrophil functions in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be related to an abnormally high level of circulating activated T cells in these patients </plain></SENT>
