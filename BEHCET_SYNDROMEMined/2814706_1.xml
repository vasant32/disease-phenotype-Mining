<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Localized deep ulcerations which have a punched-out or undermining appearance with well-defined margin placing in this region had been noted in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>41 patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were observed by colonofiberscope in Teikyo University Hospital from January 1982 to June 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10% (4 cases) of these patients, diffuse ulcerative lesions in the transverse colon and the distal colon were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These diffuse lesions in the colon with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were seemed to be much like those associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in morphological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms of these four cases with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease including oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphtha</z:e>, genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>joint pain</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruptions</z:e>, and eye involvement, preceded each colonic ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first two cases were affected with ulcerative lesion in the distal portion of the recto-sigmoid colon and the descending colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And the last two were involved in the whole transversing colon by multiple deep ulcerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Wide-spreading ulcerative lesion in the colon with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is a rare condition in the Japanese, and only two papers has been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because clinical manifestations between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> are very similar in many points as oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, eye involvement, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin eruptions</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp>, then, an overlapping field or a part of a spectrum of disease has been suggested by some authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But, in the present circumstances, they are distinct disease entities, we think that these four cases are in an atypical condition with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
