<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Ten children, diagnosed with BD, were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median (range) age at first presentation was 4 (1.2-12.0) yr, at diagnosis was 11 (3-15) yr and the follow-up period was 4.1 (0.6-6.3) yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcers</z:hpo> were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (100%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> were present in six (60%), peri-anal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were present in three (30%), skin manifestations were present in nine (90%), intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in two (20%), mild gastrointestinal symptoms were present in five (50%), joint symptoms were present in six (60%), ocular lesions were present in five (50%), but only one child had anterior and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutically, a range of drugs was used, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, that resulted in good responses in five children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide (1 mg/kg/week to 1 mg/kg/day) was used in five children who were unresponsive to other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It resulted in complete remission in three children and less frequent milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neuropathy</z:e> developed in two children and in one it was irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BD in children is similar to the disease in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide provided a useful therapeutic option for severe oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> which was unresponsive to other therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Awareness of the danger of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003477'>axonal neuropathy</z:hpo> and teratogenesis at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times during thalidomide therapy is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A low dose is probably as effective as higher doses </plain></SENT>
