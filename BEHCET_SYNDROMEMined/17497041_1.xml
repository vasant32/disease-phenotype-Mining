<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various factors have been studied to explore the pathogenesis of vascular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As endothelin (ET) is known for its potent vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory properties, we supposed that it is involved during the inflammatory process of BD pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To investigate the role of ET in BD, ET-1 concentrations were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 18 nonsmoking BD patients with pulmonary manifestations and 12 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity of ET-1 was also evaluated in alveolar macrophages (AMs) cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ET-1 levels in BD-BALF were significantly higher than those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ET-1 levels were correlated with the number of alveolar macrophages, but not with BAL-CD4/CD8 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ET-1-immunoreactivity was found mainly in AM of BD-BAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased ET-1 production from AM is associated with pulmonary BD manifestations </plain></SENT>
