<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Doppler sonography of mesenteric arteries was performed in 25 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic patients having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and in 25 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic, minimal, and mean velocities, resistive and pulsatility indexes, inner diameter, cross-sectional area, and blood flow volume of mesenteric arteries were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were compared between patient groups and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mesenteric artery flow was significantly greater in patients in the symptomatic group than in those in the asymptomatic group or in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the superior mesenteric artery, mean velocity and mean blood flow volume (0.35 +/- 0.18 m/s and 711 +/- 404 mL/min, respectively; P &lt; .0001) in the symptomatic group were significantly higher than in the asymptomatic group (0.16 +/- 0.07 m/s and 305 +/- 168 mL/min, respectively) or in controls (0.15 +/- 0.07 m/s and 290 +/- 123 mL/min, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean peak systolic velocity (1.23 +/- 0.47 m/s; P &lt; .005) in the symptomatic group was significantly higher than in controls (0.93 +/- 0.23 m/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the inferior mesenteric artery, mean velocity and mean blood flow volume (0.25 +/- 0.10 m/s and 139 +/- 79 mL/min) in the symptomatic group were significantly higher than in the asymptomatic group (0.16 +/- 0.07 m/s; P &lt; .006; and 78 +/- 26 mL/min; P &lt; .007) or in controls (0.17 +/- 0.07 m/s; P &lt; .003; 83 +/- 48 mL/min; P &lt; .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, symptomatic patients with gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were associated with a significant increase in mesenteric artery flow that could be evaluated easily on spectral patterns of arteries during Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Doppler sonographic findings also revealed that intestinal involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease without gastrointestinal symptoms is not significantly different from that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
