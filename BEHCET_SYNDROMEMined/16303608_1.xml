<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been suggested that vascular and endothelial tissue damage seen in BD is related to elevated reactive oxygen species generated by activated neutrophils from BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the formation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in BD patients in vivo, urinary level of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha) was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay after solid phase extraction in different clinical forms of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in urinary level of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha) between BD patient and healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference in urinary levels of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha) in subgroup analyses of BD patients, i.e. in mucocutaneous and vascular type BD patients; active and inactive BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the findings in literature, we found no difference in urinary level of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha) between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings show no increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation despite the augmented formation of reactive oxygen species in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may be interesting to assess formation of urinary level of 8-isoprostaglandin F(2alpha) in BD patients who do not take any medication </plain></SENT>
