<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the serum levels of galectin-3 (<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3) and galectin-3 binding protein (G3BP) and to evaluate the associations between clinical features and these levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients with BD (mean age 40.6 +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 1.4 years; 21 males, 29 females; 26 active and 24 inactive patients), 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), and 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of BD patients including BD activity and severity over the previous 4 weeks were reviewed and serum levels of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 and G3BP were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels were significantly higher in total BD patients than in healthy controls (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 10.68 +/- 0.93 versus 7.59 +/- 0.48 ng/mL; p = 0.0042 by Student's t-test), and active BD patients had significantly higher levels of serum <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 than inactive patients and controls (13.08 +/- 1.53 in active BD, 8.08 +/- 0.71 ng/mL in inactive BD; p = 0.000039 by one way ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although mean G3BP serum levels were not different in total BD patients and controls, active BD patients (6806.63 +/- 468.58 ng/mL) had higher G3BP levels than controls (5421.05 +/- 286.02 ng/mL; p = 0.031 by one way ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, serum <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 significantly increased in patients with RA (p = 0.019 by t-test) and SLE (p = 0.00069) and G3BP increased in patients with SLE (p = 0.000012), compared to those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we analyzed for associations with clinical features over the previous 4 weeks, <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 was associated with orogenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (p = 0.036 by t-test) and time elapsed from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p = 0.032, Pearson's coefficient = 0.314) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 (p = 0.013) and G3BP (p = 0.032) were positively correlated with the BD severity score for the previous 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 levels were significantly correlated with TNF-alpha (p = 0.048, Pearson's coefficient = 0.281) and G3BP levels were correlated with levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.021, Pearson's coefficient = 0.329) in total BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytokines levels, only <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 was significantly related to BD activity or severity for the previous 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum levels of <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 and G3BP are increased in active BD patients and <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi>-3 can be a new biomarker indicating disease activity in BD although their increments are not disease-specific </plain></SENT>
