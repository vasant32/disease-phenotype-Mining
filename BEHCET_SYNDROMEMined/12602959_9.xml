<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In certain inflammatory conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, over production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) could damage host cells and tissues, either directly and/or following reaction with other free radicals, such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> to form species including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Excessive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical production and impaired <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> mechanism in both the neutrophils and plasma of patients with BD have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study was designed to investigate the role of NO in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NO is an extremely unstable molecule and rapidly converted in vivo and in vitro to nitrate (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3-</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16301">NO2-</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this reason serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16301">NO2-</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3-</z:chebi> have been used as an index of NO generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We measured serum nitrate + <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels, by using an enzymatic one-step methodology based on the reduction of nitrate to <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> by nitrate reductase from Aspergillus species, in the presence of beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared to healthy controls, serum nitrate + <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels were found to be higher in active periods of BD patients (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that increased NO production in patients with BD might have critical biological activities relevant to vasculitic events in the active period of disease </plain></SENT>
