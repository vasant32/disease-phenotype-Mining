<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prolongation of the inflammatory reaction in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance and is associated with the up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The percentage of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 35 patients with BD and 30 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of antiapoptotic factors and NF-kappaB regulatory proteins were measured using Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To down-regulate NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, BD T lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to thalidomide and subjected to transfection with NF-kappaB small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although CD95 is highly expressed in BD T cells, the absence of sensitivity to CD95-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> observed may be attributable to the inhibitory action of antiapoptotic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis for major antiapoptotic proteins showed considerable up-regulation of the short form of cellular FLIP (cFLIP) and Bcl-x(L) in BD activated T cells, while levels of Bcl-2, caspase 3, and caspase 8 in activated T cells from patients with BD were comparable with those in activated T cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, expression of IKK and IkappaB was up-regulated, whereas NF-kappaB translocated to the nucleus in BD T cells, suggesting that NF-kappaB activation may modulate the expression of antiapoptotic genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, thalidomide and NF-kappaB small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> down-regulated cFLIP and Bcl-x(L) expression levels and sensitized BD activated T cells to CD95-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that NF-kappaB contributes to the regulation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> receptors leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance in BD T cell subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that NF-kappaB plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of BD, and that its pharmacologic control could represent a key strategy in modulating specific <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated disease</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
