<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-12, which is involved in the pathogenesis of BD, is a 70-kDa cytokine made of p35 and p40 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, IL-23, which is composed of a p19 subunit and a shared p40 subunit of IL-12, was discovered; as a consequence, this raises the need to re-examine previous IL-12 reports to determine whether IL-23 is also involved in BD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are changes in IL-23 in <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and sera of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the total cellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN)-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> from patients with BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and skin biopsy samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine cytokine levels, sera from patients with BD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased IL-23 p19 mRNA levels were observed for both EN-like lesions of patients with BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although we observed an elevation of IL-12/23 p40 mRNA expression in the BD lesions, this was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the levels of IL-12 p35 mRNA in BD lesions were also not significantly different from the levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, no significant changes were detected in serum IL-12 and IL-23 levels between patients with BD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control individuals, or in patients with BD before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of IL-23 p19 mRNA in BD lesions suggests that IL-23 may be associated with the development of the EN-like lesions in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
