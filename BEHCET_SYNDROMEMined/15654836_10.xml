<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously found that Txk, a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, acts as a Th1 cell specific transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate immune aberration in the pathogenesis of BD, we studied the expression of Txk and Th1 cytokines in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytokine production by the lymphocytes was assessed using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PBL produced excessive Th1 associated cytokines including IFN-gamma and IL-12 spontaneously and in response to exogenous HSP60-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> stimulation, which was shown to induce proliferation of PBL, in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Circulating CD4+ T cells expressed excessive Txk protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A majority of cells infiltrating into <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> expressed IFN-gamma in the BD specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-12 and IL-18 were also expressed in the mononuclear cell aggregates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes accumulating in the skin lesion expressed higher levels of Txk as compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001047'>atopic dermatitis</z:hpo> lesions, a typical Th2 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma, IL-18 and Il-12 were detected in the BD <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, which may induce preferential development of Th1 cells in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mononuclear cell aggregates contained Txk expressing cells in such <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Collectively, Txk expressing Th1 cells and the Th1 associated cytokines may play a critical role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
