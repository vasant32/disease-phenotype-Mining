<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are reported to respond well to S antigen, to interphotoreceptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> binding protein (IRBP) and to several of their uveitogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, in particular, the S antigen derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without ocular involvement were reported not to differ in their responses to S antigen from the responses in the control group, yet 35% of them responded to IRBP and approximately two thirds of them responded to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> M, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> N, R-4, or R-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The responses were inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to CD4 and to class II MHC HLA-DR molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of lymphocyte responses to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> antigens in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> might indicate a preclinical stage of ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these data support the idea that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> specific antigens may play a role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
