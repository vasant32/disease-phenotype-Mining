<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The induction of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease symptoms by these antigens was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Delayed skin reactions to whole cells and cell walls of streptococci were frequently observed in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but only a few skin reactions were observed in other diseases and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The skin reactions to the other bacteria were also strong in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but the differences between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and the other diseases were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the induction of systemic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease symptoms was observed after the streptococcus skin test in 15 of 85 cases tested, but no case of induction by the other bacteria was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study supports the possible pathogenetic role of certain streptococcal antigens in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
