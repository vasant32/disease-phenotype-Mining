<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional and descriptive study, 30 consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients were included, 15 of them with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were also divided into two subgroups according to the presence or absence of clinical activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF levels, basal and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39099">Ca+</z:chebi>+ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> (A23187)-induced leukocyte (cellular) PAF activities, and platelet-rich plasma DeltaCD62P activity (the mean fluorescent density difference between CD62P phycoerythrin-positive and -negative stains) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the thrombotic group, plasma PAF (P=0.001), basal leukocyte PAF (P=0.017), induced leukocyte PAF (P=0.024), and DeltaCD62P (P=0.023) levels were significantly higher than in the nonthrombotic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the whole group of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients, there was a positive correlation between plasma PAF and DeltaCD62P levels (r=0.533, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we compared clinically active and inactive patients with respect to the above parameters, there was no significant difference, irrespective of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAF (P=0.001), basal leukocyte PAF (P=0.004), and DeltaCD62P (P=0.038) levels were significantly higher in the presence of both clinical activity and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than of clinical activity alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Platelet-activating factor and CD62P may contribute to endothelial injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> development in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These two parameters seem related to the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rather than clinical activity </plain></SENT>
