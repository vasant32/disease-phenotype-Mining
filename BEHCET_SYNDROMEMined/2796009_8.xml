<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparative study of slit-lamp examination and flare-cell meter measurements was carried out in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001094'>iridocyclitis</z:hpo> in a total of 251 measurements in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> of various etiologies, including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada</z:e>'s disease and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data obtained by these two methods showed a significant overall correlation both in the measurement of flare intensity (Kendall tau = 0.580, P less than 0.001) and cell count (tau = 0.390, P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Problems inherent to the slit-lamp examination were marked in terms of wide variations in grading within groups and large overlaps in scores between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The flare-cell meter was highly reliable in the measurement of flare intensity; whereas it could not detect low numbers of cells in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-<z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eyes</z:mp> of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were divided into three groups based on the interval from the last ocular attack episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flare-cell meter examination revealed that values for flare intensity remained abnormally high even in patients free from an attack episode for more than six months prior to the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was considered that deterioration or breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier function persists in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
