<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various forms and degrees of degranulation were revealed among the mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These forms were obviously more frequent in spontaneous and reactive lesions than in the uninvolved skin, 66 and 56% as compared with 7.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="18295">histamine</z:chebi> content was twofold more in the reactive lesions than in the unaffected skin of the same patient, 43 ng/mg tissue as compared with 21 ng/mg tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of our study seem suggestive of an active role of mast cells in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The role is probably similar to that of basophils in cutaneous basophilic hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
