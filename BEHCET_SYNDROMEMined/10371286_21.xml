<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen children, who fulfilled disease criteria up to the age of 16 yr, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to those of 34 adult patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An activity index and severity score were calculated for both study groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 6.9+/-3.9 yr, similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>ages of onset</z:hpo> were found in males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical spectrum of childhood BD resembled that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adult disease</z:e>; however, the prevalence of certain manifestations was different between children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with BD had significantly less <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, less vascular thromboses and more non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relatively high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was found in childhood BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activity index and severity score were significantly lower in children than in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results point to a similar systemic expression of BD in children and adults; however, the disease seems to run a less severe course in children </plain></SENT>
