<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to analyse the role of the factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutations and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 4G/5G polymorphism on the thrombotic risk of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 50 unrelated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (34 male, 16 female) were the subjects of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of 50 patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> comprised group 1, and 23 patients with no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> comprised group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 1, nine of the 27 patients (33%) were found to have the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (7.1% in healthy population), and the 4G/4G genotype was found in 23% of the patients (26% in control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient had the prothrombin G20210A mutation (2.2% in healthy control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 2, two patients (9%) had the factor V Leiden and one patient (4%) had the prothrombin G20210A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 4G/4G polymorphism was found in 30.5% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences in the frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> between group 1 and group 2 (odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-27.5) and between group 1 and the healthy population were statistically significant ( 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant association was found for the prothrombin G20210A mutation and the 4G/5G genotype between the two groups or between each group and the healthy population, indicating that the prothrombin G20210A mutation and the 4G/4G polymorphism do not play a role in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> might be a risk factor for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
