<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also aimed to examine the relationship between LV systolic strain and N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (NT-proBNP), which is a cardiac biomarker of ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Longitudinal and circumferential systolic strain assessed by STE was obtained in 32 BD patients and 27 age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP levels were also measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional and mean longitudinal strain (-17.8 ± 2.7 vs. -20.5 ± 1.8%; P &lt; 0.0001) was significantly lower in BD patients when compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas regional and mean circumferential strain values (-22.0 ± 1.6 vs. -22.2 ± 2.3%; P = 0.62) did not reveal a significant difference between the patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NT-proBNP was significantly higher in the patients than in the controls (65.18 ± 84.51 vs. 30.84 ± 14.75 pg/mL; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses revealed only NT-proBNP as the independent correlate of mean LV longitudinal strain (R = 0.603, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Longitudinal myocardial systolic function assessed by STE, which is a sensitive marker of subclinical ventricular dysfunction is impaired in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased NT-proBNP levels may be a sign of subclinical ventricular dysfunction in these patients </plain></SENT>
