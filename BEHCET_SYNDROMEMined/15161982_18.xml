<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the oral health of Turkish patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and whether it is associated with the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients with BD, 35 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) and 65 healthy Turkish controls (HC) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral health was investigated by indices applied in a BD out-patient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean scores of plaque, sulcus <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and gingival indices, probing depth and the number of extracted teeth were observed to be higher in patients with BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> compared to HC (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the linear regression analysis, plaque index score was associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and male gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An elevated plaque index score was observed to be a significant risk factor for increased severity score in patients with BD in the logistic regression analysis (P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral health is impaired in BD and associated with disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement of the oral health of BD patients may affect their disease course, leading to a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
