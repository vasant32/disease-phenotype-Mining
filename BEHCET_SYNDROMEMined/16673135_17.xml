<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report on the results of interferon-alpha 2a (IFNalpha) treatment in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> unresponsive to conventional immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 44 patients who had been treated with IFNalpha between September 2001 and May 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial dose of IFNalpha was 6 MU/day in 37 patients (84.1%) and 3 MU/day in 7 patients (15.9%), and was gradually tapered after <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> was suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> were discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were discontinued or maintained at a dosage of less than 10 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> equivalent per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were recurrence of posterior or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> attacks and changes in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients (36.4%) remained relapse free during treatment, whereas 28 (63.6%) patients had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these were considered treatment failures and were switched to other treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 40 patients, the mean duration of treatment was 12.4+/-10.8 months (range 3-45 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 40 patients (22.5%) treatment could be discontinued 22.2+/-13.4 months after therapy, and 8 (20%) of these patients had sustained remission for up to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients (7.5%) were switched to other therapies because of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attacks per 6 months was reduced from 1.6+/-1.2 to 0.8+/-0.9 in 26 patients who had a minimum follow-up of 6 months before and after IFNalpha therapy (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant improvement in visual acuity and this was preserved throughout follow-up in 38 (95%) of 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A partial or complete response was obtained with IFNalpha therapy in 91% of Turkish patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> refractory to conventional immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that there may be differences in therapeutic efficacy and side-effect profile of IFNalpha in different patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
