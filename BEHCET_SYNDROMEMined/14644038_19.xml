<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSF and serum samples from 33 patients with NB, 25 with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), 20 patients with infectious and/or inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (IN) and 14 with other noninflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (NIN) were investigated by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the CSF, CXCL10 levels were significantly higher in NB and IN than NIN and MS, whereas CXCL8 was increased in NB compared to NIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCL2 levels in MS CSF and sera were lower, whereas CXCL8 in MS sera was higher than the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-12 was elevated in CSF of IN compared to NB and NIN and also in the CSF of MS compared to NIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was detected for IL-10 and IL-17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results reflect that NB has a mediator pattern in resemblance with non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammations</z:mp> such as neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> such as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, suggesting that a currently unknown <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> might be the trigger of a vasculitic process in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
