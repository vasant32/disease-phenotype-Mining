<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of action is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first study investigating the influence of IFN-alpha2a on intracellular cytokines in T-cells in patients with BD in comparison to healthy controls and to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cytokine expression of T-cells was investigated in 10 patients with BD before and 4 and 12 weeks after initiation of treatment with IFN-alpha2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>10 patients with AS and 10 healthy individuals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assayed by flow cytometry for the cell surface markers CD3, CD8 and CD4 and for the intracellular cytokines interleukin 2 (IL 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fraction of CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells producing IL 2 was significantly lower in untreated BD and AS patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.02 and 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the number of IFN-g-producing CD3+ T-cells in untreated BD patients was elevated in comparison to both control groups (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-cell cytokine analysis of BD patients revealed a significant increase of IL 2-production in T-cells during IFN-alpha2a treatment (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD4+ T-cells producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha increased significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In BD and AS, CD3+ and CD4+ T-cells producing IL 2 are reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This may hint at a similarity in the pathogenesis of these HLA-class I-associated disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha2a induces restoration of IL 2-production in patients with BD which is likely to be one mechanism of action of IFN-alpha2a </plain></SENT>
