<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study involved 150 patients with BD and 140 healthy controls, and investigated the role of proinflammatory cytokine gene polymorphisms in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the TNF-α (-238) G/G genotype was significantly higher in the patient group, compared to the controls (p &lt; 0.001), whilst the G/A genotype was significantly lower in the patients with BD (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD showed a significant increase in the TNF-α (- 308, - 238) GG haplotype (p &lt; 0.001), whilst there was a significant decrease in the GA haplotype (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous, IL-6 (- 174) C/G genotype (p = 0.005), and the IL-6 (- 174, nt565) haplotype CG (p &lt; 0.001), were significantly decreased in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased production of proinflammatory cytokines in BD could be a consequence of specific, cytokine gene polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Particular genotypes and haplotypes in TNF-α were over-represented in BD, which may, in turn, predispose individuals to this disease </plain></SENT>
