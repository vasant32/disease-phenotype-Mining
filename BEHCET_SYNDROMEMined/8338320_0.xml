<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, 29 of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy subjects were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (48%) had detectable levels of circulating antibodies against the corneal epithelium compared with two (10%) of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient age had a negative effect on the induction of antibodies, whereas there were neither positive nor negative associations of antibody positivity rates with factors such as gender, the duration of the illness, the activity of the disease, the occurrence rate of the attacks, immune suppressant therapy, and the levels of circulating immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study clearly demonstrated the high incidence of corneal antibodies in certain diseases of immunologic origin, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further investigations should be done to reveal clues about the presumed effects of local and systemic factors on the production of anticorneal antibodies </plain></SENT>
