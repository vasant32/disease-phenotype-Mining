<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurobehçet disease (NBD) is a rare complication of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (BD) but with important burdens of morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about this complication because there are no validated diagnostic criteria, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the studies have small number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence reported normally ranges between 5% and 15% and it is more frequent amongst men between 20 and 40 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The typical presentations include focal parenchymal lesions, vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and aseptic meningo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied medical histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted to the hospital and discharged from it with diagnosis of BD from January 1996 to September 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NBD was defined as having neurological and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> with compatible abnormalities in MRI and/or cerebrospinal fluid and without another possible explanation for their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> was diagnosed in 25 patients and seven from these patients fulfilled our criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858762" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurobehcet disease</z:e> (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with NBD were significantly younger at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their symptoms and had a significantly longer evolution until diagnosis and treatment compared to patients with non-Neuobehçet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six presented a relapsing-remitting pattern, with a good outcome with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As reported in previous studies, progressive course was less frequent, with only one case, and had a more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brainstem involvement bears a poorer prognosis because it is linked with a progressive evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our series, NBD complication was not that infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is very important to be highly suspicious of this possibility to start early a correct treatment </plain></SENT>
