<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a disease of unknown etiology, which has multisystemic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This multisystemic involvement might be the clue for an autoimmune pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate an autoimmune pathogenesis, we examined immunoreactans depositions in the skin of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The skin samples of 108 BD patients (28 perilesional skin, 44 positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test site, 22 negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test site, 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin) were examined for the depositions of immunoglobulin (Ig)M, IgG, IgA, complement 3 (C(3)), and fibrinogen (F) using direct immunofluorescence (DIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were statistically compared to the DIF of 36 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients and 20 healthy controls using chi(2) Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Highly significant immunoreactans depositions were obtained in BD (deposition rates: IgM 70.3%, IgG 0%, IgA 20.3%, C(3) 62.9%, F 83.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The comparison with SLE revealed no differences in IgM, IgA, and C(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, IgG deposition was higher in SLE while F deposition was higher in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both BD and SLE, the Ig depositions were highly significant when the data were compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significant deposition of immunoreactans in BD, especially in the negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin sites, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study is the first controlled study revealing positive Ig depositions in BD, and it is expected to help us to reconsider the autoimmune pathogenesis in BD </plain></SENT>
