<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Articular symptoms and signs are present in about 75% of cases and characterized by seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that both serum and erythrocyte nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO(.)) levels, the most abundant free radical in the body, were elevated in BD and associated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study further investigated NO(.) levels in the synovial fluid and serum from patients with active and inactive BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 23 BD patients with articular involvement (14 men and 9 women) satisfying International Study Group criteria and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (9 men and 6 women) undergoing elective arthroscopy were included in this case-control investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synovial fluid and serum were obtained from BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory findings including neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were used to classify BD patients as active (n = 11) or inactive (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Synovial as well as serum NO(.) levels were compared between the groups and correlation analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> phase reactant levels were significantly higher (for each, p &lt; 0.01) in BD patients than control subjects in the active period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean synovial NO(.) level in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (mean +/- SD 76.61 +/- 11.95 micromol/l) was significantly higher than in inactive patients (46.16 +/- 8.89 micromol/l, p &lt; 0.001) and healthy control subjects (39.60 +/-8.03 micromol/l, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference between inactive patients and controls was not significant (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Active BD patients had significantly higher serum NO(.) levels (38.84 +/- 9.15 micromol/l) than inactive patients (30.91 +/- 5.88 micromol/l, p = 0.018) and control subjects (28.86 +/- 5.91 micromol/l, p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Increased synovial NO(.) levels in active BD patients probably reflect a nonspecific inflammatory process of the synovium and, therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> as a common finding of BD </plain></SENT>
