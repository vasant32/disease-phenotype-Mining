<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Main lesion was ovoid or geographic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> with a mean diameter of 2.7 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> was single in 15 cases and multiple in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On six resected specimens, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> involved submucosa in three, muscle layer in one, and serosa in two cases with an undermining tendency and transmural <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were present in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> nor <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was localized in the ileocecal area, with extension to the ascending colon in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skip lesions were observed in the transverse colon and descending colon in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Destruction of surrounding mucosa resulted in cecal contraction in 19 cases, widening of the ileocecal valve in 19, and fold thickening in the terminal ileum in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six cases (30%) manifested as ileocecal mass accompanied by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, fold thickening, and adjacent mucosal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The appendix was visualized in only three (20%) of the 15 patients with no history of appendectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On follow-up study of 15 cases, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> disappeared or decreased in size in 13 cases (86%) and the mucosal deformity was not improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our results, we believe that the characteristic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> enema examination are ovoid or geographic, relatively large, and deep ulcerations with persistent surrounding deformity which tend to localize in the ileocecal area </plain></SENT>
