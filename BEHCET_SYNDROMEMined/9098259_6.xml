<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Even though conjunctiva is not primarily involved in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, it may reflect the immunopathologic process when <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is induced by biopsy of conjunctiva, a phenomenon similar to the induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> at skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conjunctival biopsy specimens obtained 48 hours after a 2-mm biopsy of the epibulbar conjunctiva in 26 Turkish patients with inactive ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and 9 Turkish patients with inactive idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were studied by immunoperoxidase using a panel of monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD1, -CD3, -CD4, -CD5, -CD14, -CD22, -CD25, and -CD67, HLA-DR, E-selectin, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>Immunopathology</z:mpath> of the conjunctival specimens obtained at the time of first biopsy was not significantly different between the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and the idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second-biopsy specimens of the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease showed significantly greater numbers of T cells (CD3+, CD4+) and granulocytes (CD67+) as well as HLA-DR+ and ICAM-1+ cells in the substantia propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelium of the conjunctiva in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease had significantly more pronounced expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the conjunctival specimens in either group showed VCAM-1 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a more intense antigen-independent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> develops with recruitment of both neutrophils and T lymphocytes of helper/ inducer phenotype in the conjunctiva of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease in response to surgical trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 in the conjunctiva of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease may suggest a critical role for these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules in the initial events of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
