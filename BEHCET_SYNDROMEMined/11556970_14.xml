<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is strongly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B51 in many ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no published report as yet with respect to this association among the Iranian people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since it is now known that the B51 antigen can be encoded by 21 alleles, B*5101-B*5121, we performed HLA-B*51 allele typing as well as HLA class I genotyping of 48 Iranian patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, the frequency of the B*51 allele was significantly higher (62.1%) in the patient group as compared with the ethnically matched control group (31.8%) (Pc=0.067, R.R.=3.51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the genotyping of B*51 alleles, 33 out of the 36 B*51-positive patients possessed B*5101 and the remaining 3 carried B*5108 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that Iranian patients with BD also had a strong association with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, this significantly high incidence of HLA-B*51 was found to be caused by an increase in both the HLA-B*5101 and HLA-B*5108 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the HLA-B*51 allelic distribution between the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
