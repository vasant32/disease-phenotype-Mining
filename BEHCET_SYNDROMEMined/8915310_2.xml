<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients were coincubated with human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) and human keratinocytes (HK) in vitro; interactions of PBL with HDMEC and HK were investigated using an established fluorometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interactions of patients' PBL with HDMEC, HK, or both were the main outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant increase of fluorescence with increasing PBL/HDMEC ratios was seen in patients and controls (P &lt; .001); patients showed a significantly higher increase of fluorescence at higher PBL/HDMEC ratios (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PBL/HK coincubation did not show significant alterations compared with the basal fluorescence signals of HK monolayers alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocyte and HDMEC fluorescence values that were more than 2 SDs of controls (defined as positive result of assay) were found in a significantly higher number of patients with 2 or more active symptoms at the time of investigation (83%) compared with patients with only 1 active symptom (10%) (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other clinical data did not correlate with the results of the PBL/HDMEC coincubation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate enhanced in vitro interaction of PBL from patients with ABD with HDMEC, which was additionally shown to be a marker of the activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
