<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the data obtained from neuropsychological evaluations of 12 neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet Disease</z:e> (NBD) patients who had been followed up for 35.6+/-23.7 months with successive neuropsychological testing by a comprehensive battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>Memory impairment</z:hpo>, which seems to stem basically from a retrieval deficit, was the major finding in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most severely affected memory process was delayed recall, being impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients in the verbal and/or visual modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was followed closely by an impairment in the process of acquisition and storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, a "clinical impression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality change</z:hpo>" toward either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000741'>apathy</z:hpo> was seen in 8 of the 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>Attention deficit</z:hpo> was of the third highest frequency and was present in 7 patients, followed by deficits of executive functions of frontal system which were present in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other cognitive domains were rarely involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological status deteriorated insidiously, regardless of the neurological attacks during the follow-up period in most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our observations also showed the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> prior to detectable lesions on CT or MRI, emphasizing the need for neuropsychological testing in NBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The late stages of the disease seem to be reflected in MRI as an enlargement of the third ventricle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the upper brainstem, which could be compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our series, a rather selected group, suggests that NBD can be associated with a special pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality change</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The designation of any specific neurobehavioral syndrome for NBD, however, awaits further study </plain></SENT>
