<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 62 patients who presented to the Department of Ophthalmology at Ankara Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey and diagnosed as having BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were placed into three age groups based on the age at the time of BD presentation: group 1, birth to 10 years old; group 2, 11-15 years old; group 3, 16-20 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these three age groups, the objective was to identify the ocular and extraocular clinical findings and complications of BD, and to uncover the role of gender, if exists, in the aetiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The findings indicated that gender played no significant role in the aetiology of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, a family history of BD was more prevalent, and the most common ocular finding was bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent form of ocular involvement in groups 2 and 3 was bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of disease complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patient age appeared to define the type of ocular involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was the most frequent ocular finding in BD patients younger than 10 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> was the most frequent in patients older than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a family history of BD was more frequent among patients younger than 10 years, family screening for BD is considered critical for early and accurate diagnosis of BD, as well as for the control of its complications </plain></SENT>
