<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-two patients diagnosed as having CTD associated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> (CTDaPAH) were retrospectively analyzed among 2189 patients with CTD in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 1997 and September 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two (3.7%) patients (75 females and 7 males), aged 41 years, were found to have CTDaPAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases included mixed CTD (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>), systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151449" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (pSS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), undifferentiated CTD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical manifestations of CTDaPAH were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on exertion (84.1%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Raynaud's phenomenon</z:e> (56.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) level of these patients was (65.71 +/- 20.44) mm Hg, with the decrease of PaO2 and PaCO2 level [(70.37 +/- 15.02) mm Hg, (27.88 +/- 6.46) mm Hg, respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diffusing capacity of the lungs measured using <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> was decreased [D(L)CO pred% (51 +/- 14)%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>13%, 32%, 29% and 8% of these patients were grouped to class I, II, III and IV, respectively, on NYHA functional classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the patients received treatment for underlying CTD and traditional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi>, the condition of elevated PASP had not been improved with the exception of a marginal decrease of PASP in SLE patients [(76.47 +/- 18.20) mm Hg --&gt; (69.08 +/- 20.77) mm Hg] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (15.85%) patients died during an average of 4.33 years follow-up, compared to the mortality of those with non-CTDaPAH (2.75%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower level of PaO2 [(58.51 +/- 16.16) mm Hg] and higher proportion of NYHA class III, IV [38.46% (5/13), 30.77% (4/13), respectively] were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> group compared to survivors [PaO2 (73.25 +/- 14.32) mm Hg; NYHA class III, IV 34.78% (24/69), 5.80% (4/69), respectively] (P &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.05; respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> is a common complication of CTDs, which occurs often in the forth year after initial CTD manifestations and is earlier in patients with SLE or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>, compared to those with pSS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CTDaPAH could be very severe, which will lead to lower level of PaO2 and more advanced NYHA classification, and therefore reduce the survival rate of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Doppler echocardiography and lung function test are necessary to detect <z:chebi fb="11" ids="104011,31204,33848,53305">PAH</z:chebi> early </plain></SENT>
