<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the protein C activation system in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and its correlation with venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (12 with VTE) and 78 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study, and levels of protein C, protein S, activated protein C (APC), protein C inhibitor (PCI), soluble thrombomodulin (TM), antithrombin (AT), alpha(1)-antitrypsin, fibrinogen, factor VIII, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (VWF) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC and TM levels were significantly lower in patients than in controls, whereas protein S, AT, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, fibrinogen, factor VIII, VWF and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APC, PCI and TM levels were lower in patients with VTE (0.65 +/- 0.19 ng/ml, 86% +/- 22% and 15.5 +/- 7.1 ng/ml respectively) than in those without VTE (0.78 +/- 0.17 ng/ml, 100% +/- 15% and 22.1 +/- 15.3 ng/ml) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients, APC levels below 0.75 ng/ml (10th percentile of the control group) increased the risk of VTE about fivefold (odds ratio = 5.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-23.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results show that reduced APC levels are associated with the high incidence of VTE in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
