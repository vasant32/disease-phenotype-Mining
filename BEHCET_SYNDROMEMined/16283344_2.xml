<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of null genotypes of GST-M1 and GST-T1 with BD since some preliminary molecular genetic data were recently published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four Turkish BD patients (42 male, 52 female, 37.1+/-10.4 years) and 140 healthy volunteers (70 male, 70 female, 36.8+/-11.7 years) matched for age and gender with the patients as the control group were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distributions of GST-M1 and GST-T1 genotypes were determined by multiplexed PCR using three sets of primers for GST-M1, GST-T1, and beta-globulin genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association between BD and the frequencies of GST-M1 and GST-T1 null genotypes when compared to controls by separate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, by cross and pooled combination analysis there was a significant association between the frequencies of pooled GSTs with one or both null genotypes in BD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first evidence that the association between the frequencies of GST-M1 and GST-T1 null genotypes and BD might be dependent on the interaction of multiple null allele polymorphisms rather than a single null allele of GST-M1 and GST-T1 </plain></SENT>
