<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) mainly appears in mucosa and affects 5-40% of patients, however the effects of the disease on lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and esophageal contractions are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate esophageal motor function and to identify whether there was any specific motility pattern for patients with BD who had upper GI symptoms without endoscopic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 25 patients with BD, with a mean age of 43.1 (range 20-66) years, were admitted to our clinic whose main complaints were dyspeptic such as reflux, epigastric pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>bloating</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>25 healthy and age-matched individuals were also included in the study as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After one night fasting, LES pressure and esophageal contractions were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Esophageal motor abnormalities were detected in 16% (4/25) of these patients with manometric studies (non-specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">esophageal motor disorder</z:e> in 1, esophageal hypomotility in 2, and LES <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in 1 patient); 16% (4/25) of these patients had endoscopic findings and overall 32% (8/25) of the cases showed esophageal pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases with esophageal motor abnormalities were suffering from reflux and endoscopy showed grade B <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo> in 2 of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median LES pressure and LES relaxation were significantly lower in patients with BD compared to the control group (16.8 +/- 10.5 vs. 20.4 +/- 6.1, p = 0.02, and 92.1 +/- 10.1 vs. 96.4 +/- 4.5, p = 0.03 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Esophageal involvement in BD is significantly high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose manometric studies are necessary to evaluate esophageal manifestations in BD patients with esophageal symptoms even without endoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
