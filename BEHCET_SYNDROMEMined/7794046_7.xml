<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is associated with polymorphism of HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, DQB1, and TAP1 and TAP2 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty eight Spanish BD patients and 116 ethnically matched unrelated healthy subjects were typed at the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 loci using polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific oligotyping (PCR/SSO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TAP1 and TAP2 alleles were assigned using amplification refractory mutation system-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TAP1C was absent in BD patients, but was found in 12.1% of control subjects (pcorr &lt; 0.05; relative risk = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a linkage disequilibrium between HLA-DQB1*0501 and TAP2B was observed in BD patients (delta = 0.095, pcorr &lt; 0.02), but not in the control group (delta = -0.0031, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The complete absence of TAP1C alleles in BD patients may indicate that TAP1 polymorphism is not without some significance in the development of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the existence of a linkage disequilibrium between HLA-DQB1*0501 and TAP2B in our patients suggests that the gene conferring susceptibility for BD is inherited as an extended haplotype in the population studied </plain></SENT>
