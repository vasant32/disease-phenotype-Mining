<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NK cell activity in the peripheral blood of patients in the clinically-active stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> was significantly lower than that of patients in the inactive stage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, it was observed that the actual number of NK cells was markedly increased in the peripheral blood of patients with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of alpha-interferon (INF-alpha) to these cells showed significant augmentation of NK cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> lack a factor which activates NK cells </plain></SENT>
