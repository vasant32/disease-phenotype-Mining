<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> cases that were followed up in our ward from January 2000 to January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria were those of International Study Group on <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> mouth was required) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were retrieved and analysed with two softwares (Access(®) and Epi Info(®)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed 30 cases with vascular lesions on a series of 92 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients were male, with an average age around 40 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The venous manifestations, concerning essentially the lower limbs (deep and superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) were found at 27 patients (90 %), and the average of age during the appearance of the venous lesions was 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial lesions appear more late in 13 patients (43 %) (average of age 43 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We noted, on the other hand, 11 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and five cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> was necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in association with the others drugs (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, immunosuppressors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the patients having had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, six were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The outcome was favorable for most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> and two post-surgery complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient died in the consequences of an intragastric break of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The vascular involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is manifested primarily by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Achieving blood pressure, less common, is problematic therapeutic because of the recurrent and life threatening </plain></SENT>
