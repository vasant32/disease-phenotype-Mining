<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean serum IL-8 level of the patients (14.6 +/- 3 pg/ml) was significantly higher than that of controls (10.8 +/- 3 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since IL-8 is known to have proinflammatory properties, it may play some role in the pathogenesis of A-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the activity of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) in the 43 patients with A-BD and in the 46 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum SOD activity was markedly increased in the patients with A-BD (13.1 +/- 3%), especially in active A-BD, compared with that in the healthy volunteers (6.7 +/- 3%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest the involvement of IL-8 and SOD in the pathogenesis of A-BD as seen in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
