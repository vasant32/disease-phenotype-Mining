<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the usefulness of laser flare-cell photometry to quantify intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study comprised 47 healthy individuals, 78 Behçet patients without ocular involvement, 54 Behçet patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attack and 53 Behçet patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single observer assigned clinical scores to anterior chamber cells, vitreous haze, and fundus lesions in the attack group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laser flare-cell photometry measurements were performed by another observer who was masked to the clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography was performed only in the remission group, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> leakage was scored by a masked retina specialist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attack was analyzed in eyes with high versus low flare values in the remission group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were anterior chamber flare in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients compared to the control group, and correlations of flare with clinical scores of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman's bivariate correlation test, linear regression method, and Kaplan-Meier method were used for statistical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean flare was not increased in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> both during attacks and in remission (P &lt; 0.001 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was found between anterior chamber flare and anterior chamber cell score (rho = 0.705), vitreous haze score (rho = 0.588), and fundus score (rho = 0.464) in the attack group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the remission group, there was a significant correlation between flare and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography leakage score, and the risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attack was significantly higher in eyes with flare values &gt;6 photons/msec than in eyes with flare values &lt; or =6 photons/msec (right eyes, P &lt; 0.001; left eyes, P = 0.0184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Laser flare-cell photometry is a useful objective method in the quantitative assessment of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The use of this quantitative technique in clinical trials of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> may provide comparable data, as it gives an objective measure of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, it may reduce the need for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography because it seems to be especially useful in monitoring persistent <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular leakage in patients who are clinically in remission </plain></SENT>
