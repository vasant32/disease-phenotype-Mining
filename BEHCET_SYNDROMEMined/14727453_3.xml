<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) genes are located in the vicinity of the HLA-B locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the promoter region of TNF-alpha gene has been found to be associated with altered TNF secretion, and it may have a prominent role in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001846'>increased inflammatory responses</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group consisted of 99 Behçet's disease patients and 96 healthy matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha -308 and -376 promoter alleles were assigned by the digestion of each amplified PCR product with NcoI and TasI enzymes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the distribution of TNF-alpha promoter region polymorphisms between patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the presence of uncommon -308A and -376A alleles and the manifestations or severity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha -308A allele and HLA-B*50 was found to be associated in this series of Turkish patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The role of TNF-alpha promoter region -308 and -376 polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is not supported by this data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of TNF-alpha in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be caused by other polymorphisms in the TNF gene or by post-transcriptional mechanisms </plain></SENT>
