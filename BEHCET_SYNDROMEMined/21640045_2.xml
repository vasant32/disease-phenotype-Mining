<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As cytokines seem to have important roles in the pathogenesis of BD and production of cytokines could be affected by genetic polymorphisms, this study was performed to investigate gene polymorphisms of a number of cytokines in the patients with BD in comparison with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and fifty patients with BD were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-2 (-330, +166), IL-4 (-1098, -590, -33), IL-10 (-1082, -819, -592), IL-12 (-1188), IFN-γ (5644), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (codon 10, 25), and IL-4RA (+1902) typing were performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients with BD, there were significantly increased frequency of IL-2 (-330) GG genotype (p&lt;0.001), IL-4 (-33) CC genotype (p&lt;0.001), and TGF-β (codon 10) CC genotype (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile a significant decrease in the frequency of IL-4 (-33) TC genotype (p&lt;0.001) was detected in the patient group in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genotype CC of TGF-β at codon 10 was also significantly overrepresented in the patient group (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype frequencies of IL-4 (-1098, -590, -33) showed that the frequency of TTC haplotype was significantly increased in the patients (p&lt;0.001), whereas TTT haplotype was significantly decreased in this group of patients (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was not any significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies of IL-10, IL-12, IFN-γ, and IL-4RA between patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms could play a role in the pathophysiology of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this study could suggest a tendency towards higher production of IL-2 and lower production of IL-4 in the patients with BD </plain></SENT>
