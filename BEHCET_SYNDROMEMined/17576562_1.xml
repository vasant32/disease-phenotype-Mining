<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS) having two risk factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) and oral contraceptive (OC) usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 33-year-old woman with BD was admitted to the Emergency Unit with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distention</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> started 12 days ago before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the patient was in a shock state, she was taken to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the suspicion of abdomen-originated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abdominal ultrasound showed massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abdominal MRI revealed an inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction starting above the renal veins and diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the right and medial hepatic veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extensive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the IVC and the hepatic veins (BCS) which led to shock was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to BD, the unnotified OC usage for a year by the patient without her doctor's knowledge was recognized as possible precipitating factor of BCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulse methylprenisolone was started for three consecutive days to treat active BD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IVC digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed occlusion of the IVC below the hepatic veins with extensive collateral circulation originating at the occlusion level suggesting that obliteration had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since intralesional thrombolytic therapy failed, the patient was transferred to a liver transplantation center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While waiting for an appropriate donor, the patient died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since BCS is mortal and deemed multi-factorial, every patient with a thrombotic risk factor such as BD should be questioned for other possible causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
