<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The highest prevalence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) has been reported in Turkey, and therefore research of relations between BD and other disorders have become important in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> impair tooth brushing, reducing complaints about aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> will motivate the patient to maintain better oral hygiene performance and will thus reduce plaque accumulation and periodontal scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this controlled case study was to evaluate the relationship between the severity of periodontal scores and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and to compare the treatment modalities with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi>-doped <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33331">yttrium</z:chebi> aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser and medication on the recurrent aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in BD patients by considering the degree of pre- and post-treatment pain, discomfort and functional complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The periodontal status of 28 BD patients was evaluated according to periodontal indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BD patients were also assessed for clinical severity score as described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of pre- and post-treatment pain and functional complications were assessed at patient visits on days 1, 4 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Periodontal indices, the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and the daily frequency of tooth brushing were related to the severity scores of BD (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that BD patients treated with the Nd:YAG laser had less post-treatment pain and fewer functional complications and reported immediate relief of pain and faster healing (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that periodontal status is worse in BD patients and is associated with disease severity; also, the Nd:YAG laser has better patient acceptance, shorter treatment time and lower rates of pain and post-treatment adverse events among BD patients with oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
