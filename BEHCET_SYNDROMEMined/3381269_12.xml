<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study were to compare, in a masked manner, conventional treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28830">Leukeran</z:chebi>) to treatment with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty patients suffering from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome with active ocular inflammatory reactions were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were randomly assigned to conventional or CsA regimens and were regularly examined by a multidisciplinary group of physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unmasked internist modulated the treatment and recorded systemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The masked ophthalmologists recorded the ocular findings without knowledge of the assigned type of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the results 3 years after initiation of the study shows that CsA is more effective than conventional therapy in decreasing the active ocular inflammatory processes and arresting the deterioration of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding the extraocular symptoms, however, conventional therapy is superior to CsA, especially for the control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side effects were recorded in a much higher incidence among patients receiving CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, tight and constant control of the CsA dosage as performed in this study has, so far, prevented clinical and biochemical nephrotoxic manifestations in patients assigned to this treatment </plain></SENT>
