<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relation between this process and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV-1) in Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of antibodies vs HSV-1 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was studied by complement fixation in three series: A) 34 patients with BD; B) 21 with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>; C) 40 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HSV-1 specificity was established by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA typing was performed in 32 individuals from series A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of anti HSV-1 in A (76%) was greater (p = 0.045) than in C (55%) and B (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences were more evident when titers equal/superior to 1/64 were considered as positive, with this being a value exceeding the 97.5% percentage of the control series (A = 21%, C = 2%, p = 0.015), specially for the ocular BD subgroup (26%, p = 0.011 with respect to C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The B series did not differ from C (p = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the contrary no differences were observed in the distribution of titers vs CMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although a greater frequency of anti HSV-1 was observed in HLA-B51+ the differences were not significant (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of evaluable titers of anti-HSV-1 is greater in patients with BD (specially with ocular involvement) than in the control series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found between higher titers and HLA PB51+ phenotype </plain></SENT>
