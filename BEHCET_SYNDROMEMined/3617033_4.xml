<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the increased frequency of B51, DQw3, especially TA10-negative DQw3, was increased and DQw1 was decreased significantly in this subgroup of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As for complement markers, C4A Q0 was increased </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism for the DQw3 association is obscure, a possible hypothesis is that an immune-response or immune-suppression gene linked to the DQ antigens modulates the disease severity and the efficacy of treatments </plain></SENT>
