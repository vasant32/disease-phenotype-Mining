<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence to suggest that certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> are associated with the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A BD-like mouse model induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus (HSV) inoculation shows similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, thalidomide was administered in order to understand the mechanism for the improvement in symptoms in BD-like mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight out of ten thalidomide-treated mice showed improvement but none of ten placebo-treated mice (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The improvements were seen in mucocutaneous symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mice were sacrificed on the 6th day, and the spleens subjected to RT-PCR, FACS, Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, RANTES, perforin, IP-10, FasL, FasR and MIP-lalpha were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among these, TNFalpha, MIP-1alpha, perforin and Fas were influenced by thalidomide treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that thalidomide can attenuate HSV-induced BD-like symptoms in mice through the downregulation of TNFalpha (P &lt; 0.005) and the upregulation of MIP-1alpha (P &lt; 0.005), perforin (P &lt; 0.05) and FasR (P &lt; 0.1) </plain></SENT>
