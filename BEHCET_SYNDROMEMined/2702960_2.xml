<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cortical P37 of posterior tibial nerve SEPs or cervical N13 of median nerve SEPs were more frequently found in the MS patients than in the NB patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, prolongation of the central conduction time of median nerve SEPs or abnormal BAEPs were more common in NB than in MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present data showed that lesions were mainly present in the spinal cord in MS and in the brainstem in NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEPs and BAEPs were considered of great value for detecting the involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in MS and NB and distinguishing between these diseases </plain></SENT>
