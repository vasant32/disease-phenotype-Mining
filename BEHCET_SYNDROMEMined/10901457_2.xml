<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent both baseline and Acz SPET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the areas with decreased perfusion (D-ROI) and, in the same section, on areas with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> perfusion (N-ROI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ROIs were then repositioned on the corresponding section on Acz SPET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean ROI counts were then transformed into a perfusion index value (PIV) with reference to the global brain counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total we found 24 D-ROIs (17 in the cortical and 7 in subcortical grey matter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The influence of Acz infusion was selectively registered in the D-ROIs, where PIVs changed from 1.23+/-0.17 (baseline SPET) to 1.63+/-0.23 (Acz SPET) (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen in the N-ROIs (1.46+/-0.21 and 1.40+/-0.17, respectively, on baseline SPET and Acz SPET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that Acz infusion increases the regional cerebral blood flow within baseline grey matter perfusion defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that baseline perfusion abnormalities could reflect a disconnection rather than local vasculitic involvement </plain></SENT>
