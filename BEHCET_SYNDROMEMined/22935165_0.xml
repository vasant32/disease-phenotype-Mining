<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reported excessive Th1 cell activity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, Th17 cells were suggested to associate with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the role of Th17 related cytokines and signalling molecules in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of Th1 and Th17 related cytokines and related signalling molecules in PBMC of 12 patients with BD and 14 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (NC) using quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied expressions of the Th17 related cytokines in other four BD patients' <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major Th17 related cytokines were not detected in unstimulated PBMC in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After stimulation, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of TGFβ receptor type 1, IL-12 receptor β2 and suppressor of cytokine signalling protein (SOCS) 1 on PBMC were significantly enhanced in patients with BD, as compared with NC (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of RORC, a key transcription factor for Th17 cell differentiation, was comparable between BD and NC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD4+ T cells infiltrating into BD skin lesion expressed TGFβ1 much more than those infiltrating into non-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that TGFβ/Smad signalling pathway of T cells is overactive in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
