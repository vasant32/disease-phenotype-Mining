<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied interphotoreceptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi>-binding protein (IRBP), a dominant autoimmune antigen in the eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aqueous humour samples from 28 patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were analysed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) content as a marker for blood-ocular barrier breakdown and by gelatinase B zymography for the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data were correlated with the presence of intact IRBP (approximately 140 kD) as determined by Western blot analysis and with the clinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aqueous humour samples from control eyes and eyes with low disease activity showed positive immunoreactivity for intact IRBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IRBP signal weakened or disappeared with higher disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlations were observed between disease activity and levels of gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (rs=0.713; P&lt;0.001) and IgG (rs=0.580; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant negative correlations were found between levels of IRBP and disease activity (rs=-0.520; P=0.005) and levels of MMP-9 (rs=-0.727; P&lt;0.001) and of IgG (rs=-0.834; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas neutrophil elastase converted intact IRBP into an immunoreactive 55 kD <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> in vitro, the conversion by neutrophil degranulates resembled more the in vivo context with a complete degradation of IRBP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reversal of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with immunosuppressive therapy was accompanied with reappearance of intact IRBP and disappearance of IgG and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The analysis of IRBP proteolysis is useful as a biomarker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and suggests that inhibition of proteinases might become a therapeutic strategy in an inflammatory context of a damaged blood-ocular barrier </plain></SENT>
