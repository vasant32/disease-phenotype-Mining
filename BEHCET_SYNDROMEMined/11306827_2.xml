<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the Bcl-2 expression in the skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (SPR) of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (SPT) was performed on 23 patients with BD and 7 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 48 h, SPT specimens were taken by punch biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control samples were also obtained from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin of 7 patients with BD and 11 patients with BD-unrelated leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens were evaluated by routine histopathological examination and immunohistochemical Bcl-2 staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The SPT was clinically positive in 9 of 23 patients and histopathologically positive in 13 but never in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of leukocytes in 12 of 13 histopathologically positive specimens were stained with Bcl-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 3 BD-unrelated leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> samples showed Bcl-2 positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No Bcl-2 staining was found in healthy controls and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin samples of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data may suggest a role of Bcl-2-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in the pathogenesis of the SPR in BD </plain></SENT>
