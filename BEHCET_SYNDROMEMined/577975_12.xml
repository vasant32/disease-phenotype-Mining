<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed great improvement, one moderate improvement, and one was unresponsive to multiple injections of TF from different donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One case was uninterpretable because of concomitant administration of high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and brief treatment with TF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that TF therapy may be beneficial in some patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and that a trial of TF is warranted at least in the absence of severe ocular or neurologic manifestations </plain></SENT>
