<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical findings in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) seen in 2 different decades (1980s and 1990s) to determine if there has been a shift toward the appearance of less severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> caused by BD who had their first visit and at least a 4-month follow-up at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> clinic of University of Tokyo Hospital between January 1980 and December 1999 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the date of the first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical profiles were then compared between the 1980s group (133 patients, observed for 33.5+/-26.4 months) and the 1990s group (107 patients, observed for 46.9+/-32.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of ocular attacks per year, visual outcomes, and the percentage of patients who had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>Age of onset</z:hpo>, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, incidence of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, and surgical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> did not differ between the 1980s and the 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in patients in the 1990s, the number of ocular attacks per year and the percentage of patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the percentage of eyes with good visual acuity (VA) (?20/30) increased, and the percentage of eyes with poor VA (&lt;20/200) decreased significantly at both the first and the last examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for less bilateral disease and fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in the 1990s as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Through a study of Japanese patients, we confirmed that the clinical outcomes of BD, especially judging by the number of ocular attacks per year and VA, indeed improved during the 1990s </plain></SENT>
