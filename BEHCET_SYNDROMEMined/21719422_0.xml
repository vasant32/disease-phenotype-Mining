<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the effect of disease activity, gender and age on platelet and neutrophil activation in whole blood taken from patients with BD was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using an anti-coagulant Tripotassium ethylenediaminetetra <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> (K3EDTA) plus <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28177">theophylline</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> (CTAD) (K3EDTA/CTAD) that preserves the degree of platelet activation that exists in vivo, we assessed neutrophil and platelet activation, microparticles, and monocyte and neutrophil-platelet aggregate formation in 43 BD patients using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of platelet activation and microparticles in BD patients using this methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inactive [2.78 (0.56)%, P = 0.0009; 3.11 (0.78)%, P &lt; 0.0001] and active [2.28 (0.84)%, P &lt; 0.0001; 3.071 (0.67)%, P = 0.0031] BD patients had significantly higher percentages of CD62P-expressing platelets and CD62P+ platelet microparticles as compared with healthy controls (HCs) [0.84 (0.1)% and 1.23 (0.14)%], respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD62P+ platelets and CD62P+ platelet microparticles in female and male BD patients were also significantly higher than those expressed by female and male HCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD62P+ microparticles were significantly increased in the 20-30-(P = 0.0301) and 31-50-(P &lt; 0.0162) year age ranges, but not in the &gt;50-year age group of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BD is a rare, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> multi-systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and interaction of activated platelets with leucocytes has been linked to pathological disorders associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001863'>vascular inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this study demonstrates that platelet microparticle activation is increased in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, this is the first report in which changes in platelet activation in BD are concordant with the observations that BD disease activity diminishes with age </plain></SENT>
