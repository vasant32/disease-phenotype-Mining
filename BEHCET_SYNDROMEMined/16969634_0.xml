<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We wanted to see whether the active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) can cause a thrombotic disorder by decreasing the protein S (PS) activity, and we evaluated the relationship between the decreased PS activity and the disease activity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included 122 patients with BD whose PS activity levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 51 patients, the PS activity was measured again when there were changes in the number of items of "The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> Current Activity Form (BDCAF)" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rate was 2.5% (3/122), and the PS activity was low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three of the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of low PS activity in the total 122 BD patients was 27% (33/122) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of the low PS activity in the active BD patients was 33.7% (31/92), and this was significantly more frequent than in the inactive BD patients, (6.7%, 2/30) (chi(2)-test, P value = 0.0038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease of PS activity had good correlation with the increase of the number of BDCAF items (r = -0.351, P value = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PS activity decrease is related to the BD activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low PS activity can be the risk factor for thrombotic disorder and also the activity marker for BD and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
