<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To isolate autoantigens possibly involved in the pathogenesis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Autoantigens recognised by immunoglobulin G antibodies (IgG Ab) in sera from VKH patients were isolated by screening the lambda phage cDNA libraries made from melanocytes and a highly pigmented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> cell line with the patients' sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presence of IgG specific for the autoantigens in sera from patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> and healthy individuals was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relation between the specific IgG and various clinicopathological features was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: KU-MEL-1 was found to be one of the 81 isolated positive clones representing 35 distinct genes, which is a previously isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> antigen preferentially expressed in melanocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IgG Ab specific for KU-MEL-1 was detected in sera from patients with VKH in significantly higher amounts than in sera from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>, and from healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive serum KU-MEL-1 Ab was significantly associated with HLA-DRB1*0405 and male VKH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: KU-MEL-1 was identified as a new autoantigen for VKH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highly frequent induction of IgG Ab for KU-MEL-1 in HLA-DRB1*0405 positive VKH patients may suggest the possible involvement of KU-MEL-1 specific CD4(+) T cells in the pathogenesis of VKH, suggesting the possible use in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic treatments for VKH patients </plain></SENT>
