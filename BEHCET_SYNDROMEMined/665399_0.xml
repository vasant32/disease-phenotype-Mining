<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients have been given <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition 5 patients who were threatened by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> from severe <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein involvement received antilymphocyte globulins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up ranges from 1 year up to 71/2 years with an average of 31/2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> has been achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity remained unchanged or improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ocular recurrences occurred in 2 patients after decreasing the daily dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> and in 1 patient 2 years after the end of a 1-year treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The action of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> was not so constant upon systemic involvement of the disease than upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, 1 patient recovered from severe central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The review of the literature and comparison with our own experience leads to suggest that the discrepancy of the published results should be related to the variety of the immunosuppressive drugs which have been tried in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">Chlorambucil</z:chebi> seems to be the most effective and the less toxic drug </plain></SENT>
