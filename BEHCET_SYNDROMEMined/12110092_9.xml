<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The objective was to measure urinary adrenomedullin (AM) levels in patients with active or inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and compare them to levels in healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (20 men and 25 women with a mean age of 37.7 +/- 10.8 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy hospital staff volunteers as control subjects (nine men and 11 women with a mean age of 36.2 +/- 10.4 years) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary and plasma AM concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether disease activity correlates with urinary and plasma AM levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney U-test was used in statistical analysis and the values were expressed as mean +/- SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urinary excretion of AM (pmol per mg urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (81.3 +/- 35.1) was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) than in control subjects (31.2 +/- 16.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma AM levels (pmol/L) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and controls were 69.1 +/- 19.2 and 20.7 +/- 11.8, respectively; the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome patients (n = 22) had higher urinary AM levels (92.1 +/- 41.1) compared to inactive (n = 23; 70.8 +/- 32.2), the difference was not significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma AM levels in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome patients (77.5 +/- 21.2) were also higher than in inactive (61.6 +/- 17.3), but the difference was not significant (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Urinary AM levels were higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Urinary AM levels were correlated with plasma AM levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the higher AM levels found in the urine may be produced by the kidney as a result of the stimulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> during the course of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, or may come from plasma, as plasma AM levels were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the exact sites of AM synthesis by the kidney (e.g. glomeruli, blood vessels and/or tubular cells) could not be determined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further studies in this respect are necessary </plain></SENT>
