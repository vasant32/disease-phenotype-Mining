<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>gammadelta T lymphocytes (GD) have been suggested as one of the causes of cytokine dysregulation that results in neutrophils hyperactivation in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, GD can provoke cytotoxic lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> by interaction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> (MHC class I chain-related A) molecules, through NKG2D receptor on its surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CD8+ subset of gammadelta T lymphocytes (GDCD8+) has been related to regulatory T activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the phenotype and the intracellular cytokine profile in GD from peripheral blood, to discern if they were skewed to an effector or regulatory pattern in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed phenotype analysis, by three-colour flow cytometry, in 28 BD, 15 healthy controls (HC) and 14 patients with recurrent bucal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (RBU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied intracellular cytokine production in 10 BD and 14 HC, after polyclonal stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we analysed serum IL-15 and soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>, by ELISA, in 27 BD, 21 HC and 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hallmark in BD was a specific increase in CD8 expression by GD, and in GDCD8+ absolute numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of GDCD8+ presented CD8 alphaalpha homodimers and were negative for CD103, Foxp3 and CTLA-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GDCD8+ and GDCD8- were high IFNgamma-, but poor IL-2, IL-10, TGFbeta and IL-4-producing cells, with no differences between BD and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NKG2D expression on CD8+ T cells, serum IL-15 and soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> were not significantly increased in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results do not suggest a T regulatory profile for GDCD8+ neither in HC, nor in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We cannot rule out other suppression mechanisms or some <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> within this subset that could contribute to regulatory function </plain></SENT>
