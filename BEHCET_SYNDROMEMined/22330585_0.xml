<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NOD2, an intracellular pathogen recognition sensor, modulates innate defence to muropeptides derived from various <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further define a role for NOD2 in BD, we analysed NOD2 transcriptional responses in BAL-MNC from BD patients with pulmonary manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed NOD1, NOD2, T-bet and TLRs <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression with real-time polymerase chain-reaction in BAL cells obtained from 23 BD patients with pulmonary manifestations and their matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that NOD2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was highly up-regulated in BAL cells from BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> patients compared to healthy control group (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In BD patients, significant correlation was found between NOD2 and T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression (r = 0.602; P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BAL from BD patients, NOD2 and T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were significantly correlated with BAL-lymphocytes (r = 0.485, P = 0.010; r = 0684, P = 0.0001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NOD2 in BD was also correlated with TLR 2(r = 0.444; P = 0.021) and TLR 4 (r = 0.574; P = 0.001) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BAL-MNC from BD patients expressed NOD2 as a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>lung inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TLRs and NOD2 synergize for the induction of proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BAL inflammatory cells showed an increased Th1 situation as indicated by increased T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
