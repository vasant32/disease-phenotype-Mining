<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalance of pulmonary involvement varies in the range of 1-10% in various studies and its complications are severe and life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the changes of pulmonary epithelial permeability of patients with BD using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m diethylene <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38751">triamine</z:chebi> penta-<z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> ((99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>) aerosol scintigraphy, so as to begin the therapy regimen as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one nonsmoking patients with BD (8 women, 13 men; mean age 38.67 +/- 8.86 years) and 15 healthy volunteer nonsmoking controls (8 women, 7 men; mean age 50.87 +/- 12.45 years) underwent (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> aerosol inhalation scintigraphy and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects inhaled 1480 MBq of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> for 4 min in the supine position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scintigraphic data were recorded dynamically (1 frame/min) in the posterior projection on a 64 x 64 matrix for a 30-min period using a double-headed gamma camera (Infinia, GE, Tirat Hacarmel, Israel) equipped with a low-energy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-purpose parallel hole collimator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Half time of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> clearance (T (1/2)) was calculated by placing a mono-exponential fit on the curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Penetration index (PI) was also calculated by dividing the peripheral total counts by the sum of the peripheral and central total counts on the first minute image, in order to quantify the distribution of the inhaled aerosol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clearance half time of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> radioaerosols in the BD patients (24.81 +/- 6.22 min) was faster than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (46.53 +/- 22.41 min) (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant difference between PI of the patients with BD (0.15 +/- 0.03) and that of the controls (0.21 +/- 0.06) (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the mean T (1/2) values of (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> clearance or the spirometric measurements in the BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Penetration indices were not correlated with PFT in the BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lung epithelial permeability of the patients with BD was significantly higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrated that the assessment of lung epithelial permeability using (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> aerosol scintigraphy could predict the presence of lung involvement in the early stages of BD </plain></SENT>
