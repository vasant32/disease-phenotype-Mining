<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction has been documented in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, conventional echocardiographic techniques have serious limitations like its dependence on preload, afterload and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, new techniques like colour M-mode and tissue Doppler imagining (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi>) have provided additional concept in the assessment of diastolic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the LV diastolic dysfunction with conventional and new echocardiographic techniques in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients with BD (25 women, 23 men) and 26 healthy volunteers (15 women, 11 men) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LV diastolic functions were examined with mitral inflow pulse wave Doppler, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> and mitral flow propagation rate (MFPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following were accepted as diastolic dysfunction: in mitral inflow pulse wave Doppler, E/A&lt;1, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT)&gt;110 ms and deceleration time of E wave (DT)&gt;240 ms; in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> of mitral ring with pulse wave, E'/A'&lt;1; and in MFPR, velocity slope (Vp)&lt;45 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable in age, sex, heart rate, body mass index, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and basic echocardiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LV diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in BD group according to E/A&lt;1 (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When echocardiographic measurements were compared one by one for two groups, As' (late diastolic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> wave in septal wall) was found to be significantly higher in BD group (p&lt;0,0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IVRT was longer in BD group than in controls, but it did not reach statistical significance (p=0,06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction of LV is more frequent in patients with BD than in control according to E/A and As' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conventional and current techniques like <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53555">TDI</z:chebi> and colour M-mode Doppler echocardiography could be used to investigate diastolic functions in BD </plain></SENT>
