<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three eyes of 26 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease that had extracapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery between January 1993 and July 1999 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 38.9 years (range 20 to 54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean postoperative follow-up was 22.9 months (range 6 to 66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Extracapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction (ECCE) was performed in 22 eyes with and in 6 eyes without intraocular lens (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e>) implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phacoemulsification with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation was performed in 5 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the visual acuity was better in 29 eyes (87.8%) and was 0.5 or better in 14 eyes (42.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Posterior segment complications of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> and macular alterations from preoperative inflammatory episodes, restricted final acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was detected in postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> among the types of surgery; that is, ECCE, ECCE with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation, and phacoemulsification with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="7" ids="33372">neodymium</z:chebi>:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was performed in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> after extracapsular surgery was mild when surgery was performed after at least 3 months of no inflammatory signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results show that the outcomes of extracapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery mainly depend on the degree of preoperative posterior segment involvement </plain></SENT>
