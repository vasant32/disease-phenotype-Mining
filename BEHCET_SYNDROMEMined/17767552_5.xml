<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An imbalance in cytotoxic activity and cytokine production has been implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of this study showed that the NKG2A c.-4258*C, c.338-90*G, and CD94 c.-134*T alleles (P= 0.015, OR = 0.8; P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 0.5; and P= 0.034, OR = 0.8, respectively) were associated with decreased risk and that NKG2A c.284-67_-62del, c.1077*C, and the activating receptor, NKG2C c.305*T were not associated with 345 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But a significant difference in NKG2C c.305*T was detected among BD patients with ocular lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 2.1 and P= 0.0001, OR = 1.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We already showed in our previous research that HLA-E*0101 also appears to contribute to a reduction in risk through the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result led us to the analyses of the combined risk of the HLA-E and the NKG2A for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individuals harboring HLA-E*0101, NKG2A c.-4258*C, and c.338-90*G evidenced a reduced risk of BD compared with healthy controls (21.1% vs 40.1%, P &lt; 0.0001, OR = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By way of contrast, individuals without the HLA-E*0101, NKG2A c.-4258*C, and c.338-90*G alleles evidenced a twofold increased risk of BD (P= 0.014, OR = 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals without HLA-E*0101, NKG2A c.-4258*G/*G, and c.338-90*G evidenced a 4.8-fold increase in BD risk (P= 0.0002, OR = 4.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the effects of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remain unclear, our results indicate that the SNPs of the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A and its haplotypes, as well as its ligand HLA-E, are associated with BD immune systems </plain></SENT>
