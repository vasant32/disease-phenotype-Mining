<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> Quality of Life (BD-QoL) is a BD-specific measure developed in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to adapt the BD-QoL for use in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The translation was based on the guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 201 Korean patients with BD participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the psychometric properties, internal consistency and test-retest reliability were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis was performed to examine the construct validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To provide further evidence for validity, the correlation of BD-QoL with the Clinical Activity Form for Korean Patients with BD (BDCAF-K) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D) scales was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Korean version had high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha, 0.93) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.835) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factor analysis of the questionnaire revealed one interpretable factor as a general health-related quality of life factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Korean version significantly correlated with scores of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-D (r = 0.749, p = 0.000), self-rating scale of well-being over the past 28 days (r = 0.446, p = 0.000), and BDCAF-K score (r = 0.502, p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adaptation of the BD-QoL for use in Korea was successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Together with the BDCAF-K, it may be a valuable tool for assessing the influence of interventions in BD patients and outcome in clinical trials </plain></SENT>
