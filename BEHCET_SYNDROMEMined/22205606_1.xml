<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) polymorphisms have been demonstrated as a common risk factor for a number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the association of JAK2 and STAT3 polymorphisms with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) in a Han Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was performed in 503 Chinese patients with BD and 615 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotypes of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10758669, rs7857730, rs10119004) in the JAK2 and four SNPs (rs6503695, rs744166, rs2293152, and rs12948909) in the STAT3 gene were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10% of the samples were sequenced to validate the result of PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The χ(2) test was performed to compare allele and genotype distributions and Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> controls tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly increased frequency of the GG genotype of the STAT3 rs2293152 was observed in patients with BD (Bonferroni-corrected P value = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the tested SNPs of JAK2 was associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> for BD did not reveal an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a STAT3 genetic polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
