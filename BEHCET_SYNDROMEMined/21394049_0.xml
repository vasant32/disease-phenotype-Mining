<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pulmonary involvement varies in the range of 1-10% in various studies, and its complications are severe and life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To objectively assess the degree of pulmonary vascular endothelial damage in BD, the lung uptake, and the clearance rate of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m-hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (Tc-99m-HMPAO) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three nonsmoking patients with BD (10 female, 13 male) and 11 (six female, five male) healthy nonsmoking controls underwent Tc-99m-HMPAO lung scanning, pulmonary function tests (PFT), chest radiograph examination, contrast-enhanced spiral chest computed tomography scanning, and high-resolution computed tomography examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the bolus injection of 740 MBq of Tc-99m-HMPAO posterior sequential images were obtained at 1-s intervals for 150 s and subsequent images were obtained at one frame per minute (min) over a 10-min period, using a double-headed gamma camera equipped with a low-energy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-purpose parallel hole collimator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dynamic images were used to calculate the Tc-99m-HMPAO lung clearance rate (T1/2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, a static anterior image, including a large part of the liver, was obtained of 5-min duration at 10 min after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regular regions of interests were drawn over the midportion of the right lung and the highest activity area of the liver parenchyma was selected and lung/liver (L/Li) uptake ratios were calculated to represent the degree of pulmonary vascular endothelial damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chest radiograph, high-resolution computed tomography, and computed tomography findings in patients with BD were nonspecific for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a statistically significant difference between patients with BD (30.26 ± 10.55 s) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (19.53 ± 6.24 s) on their T1/2 values (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results show that the L/Li ratios on the Tc-99m-HMPAO lung scan were significantly higher in patients with BD (0.60 ± 0.19) than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.39 ± 0.07) (P = 0.0021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using a cutoff value of 0.50, 15 of 23 (65%) patients with BD had increased L/Li ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the mean T1/2 values of Tc-99m-HMPAO clearance and the PFT in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The L/Li ratios were not correlated with PFT in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The degree of pulmonary vascular endothelial damage was represented as increased L/Li ratios and decreased lung clearance rate measured on the Tc-99m-HMPAO lung scan in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that determining the T1/2 values and the L/Li ratios on Tc-99m-HMPAO lung imaging should be an objective method to assess subclinical pulmonary damage even in the early stages of BD in the patients </plain></SENT>
