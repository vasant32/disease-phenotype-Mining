<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We present our experience with surgical treatment of arterial complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (vasculo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>), and the long-term results and pitfalls of surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 1990 and January 2003, 20 consecutive patients underwent surgery to treat vasculo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients (17 of 20) were men, with mean age of 38.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four operations were performed in 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operative mortality rate was 5.8% (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 17 emergency operations, 6 because of ruptured primary abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were five others with critical limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, resulting in 3 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up postoperatively on average for 44 months (range, 6 months-14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the initial operation 10-year survival rate was 30%, 10-year complication-free survival rate was 13%, and 5-year repeat operation-free survival rate was 26% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although surgical intervention should be postponed until active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> has subsided, often this is not possible, because of the emergent nature of these problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most arterial complications of vasculo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> present with a pseudoaneurysm rupture or with impending rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An aggressive surgical approach can be life-saving in such instances, and should be undertaken regardless of long-term complications, which are more common when the operation is performed in the presence of active <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early and late results can be improved by individualizing, selecting a disease-free area for reconstruction, and eliminating use of autologous graft material </plain></SENT>
