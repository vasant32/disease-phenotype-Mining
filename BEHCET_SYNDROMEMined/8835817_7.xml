<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the potential of HCMV as an etiologic agent in RAU was proposed and studies using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) have been performed to investigate the possible presence of HCMV DNA in pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions in patients with RAU or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) of the mucocutaneous type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, formalin-fixed biopsy specimens were obtained from 13 pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions, 2 samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral mucosa and 1 ileal mucosal lesion from 9 RAU patients and 4 BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five specimens of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral mucosa from 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and 12 specimens of oral erosive or ulcerative lesions from 12 patients with erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lichen planus</z:e> (ELP) were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By PCR, HCMV DNA was detected in 5 of the 13 (38.5%) pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions, 3 from RAU patients and 2 from BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ileal mucosa specimen was also HCMV DNA-positive, whereas HCMV DNA was not demonstrated in any of the 7 specimens of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral mucosa from RAU patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects; 12 specimens of oral lesions from ELP patients were similarly negative </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that HCMV may be an etiologic agent in some cases of RAU and BD </plain></SENT>
