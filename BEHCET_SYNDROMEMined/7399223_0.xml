<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Jejunal biopsy study revealed marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of intestinal lymphatics in liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002243'>protein-losing enteropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphangiographic study showed also abnormal findings in above-mentioned diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cases of McKee dogs in which mechanism of blockade of lymphatic flow was already clarified, McKee dogs showed marked malabsorptive of fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When lymphatic flow was blocked mechanically at the thoracic duct, fat accumulation was seen in the absorptive cells as well as in dilated intestinal lymphatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> to rats, fat accumulation was seen in the matrix of absorptive cells as well as in the endoplasmic reticulums and Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, amorphous substances instead of chylomicrons were seen in dilated intestinal lymphatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies suggested that a tract of fat transportation from intestinal cells to the thoracic duct should be considered as a functional unit in fat absorption </plain></SENT>
