<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD (n = 40) having active disease and sex- and age-matched 40 controls were included </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels (hsCRP) were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
