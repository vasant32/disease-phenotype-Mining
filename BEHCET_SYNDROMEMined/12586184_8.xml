<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important outcome factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relation of HRQOL to the duration of illness, mental state, and visual acuity of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional clinical trial of 45 consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of an age-, sex-, and education-matched group of 45 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and the controls had been given a complete ophthalmic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, they completed a questionnaire comprising the SF-36 Health Survey, Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Inventory, and Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight multiple regression analyses were carried out in the patient group to determine whether total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scores, total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores, duration of the disease, and visual acuity predicted the dependent variable SF-36 subscales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the analysis of variance statistical method, comparisons of the patient and the control groups for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and the subscales of the SF-36 Health Survey indicated a statistical significance for this battery of tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with ocular involvement are susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> when compared to age and sex matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important for the ophthalmologist to know that changes in the mental state of his patient may trigger a new ocular attack, and to be aware that these changes may play a critical role in the management and preventive measures for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
