<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five patients with established BD were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with rheumatic conditions not known to be associated with venous or arterial thromboembolic phenomena served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the patients with BD (32%) had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (6 patients), arterial thromboembolic phenomena (2), or both (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were tested for IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) levels, the presence of circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LAC), protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III activity, activated protein C resistance, and where appropriate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated levels of IgG aCL were detected in 10 (40%) patients with BD compared to one (5%) in the control group (p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were noted in the other variables studied between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant correlation was found between any variable and the clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with BD do not have decreased protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III activity, activated protein C resistance, circulating LAC, or elevated levels of IgM aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant number of patients have elevated levels of IgG aCL but they are not associated with venous or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between any variable and other clinical manifestations of the disease </plain></SENT>
