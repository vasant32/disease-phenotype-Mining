<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement, especially with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, is detected in up to 80 % of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anterior segment involvement such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> is also seen in the follow-up of patients who are then treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to analyze the outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 9 patients (12 eyes) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who underwent phacoemulsification with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation in 11 eyes and extracapsular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction (ECCE) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IOL</z:e> implantation in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> between June 2001 and September 2009 were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The visual outcome and complications were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 33.8 months (range 3 to 88 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative LogMAR BCVA was 1.15 ± 0.53 (95 % CI: 0.81 - 1.49) and increased to 0.36 ± 0.32 (95 % CI: 0.15 - 0.56) at last medical visit (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most frequent postoperative complication was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">posterior capsular opacification</z:e>, which developed in 2 eyes (17 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other complications were mild fibrinous reaction in 1 eye (8 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The great majority of the patients regained and retained a good visual outcome and had fewer postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
