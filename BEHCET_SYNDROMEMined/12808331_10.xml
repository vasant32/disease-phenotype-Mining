<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ICAM1 gene mutations are associated with BD in Caucasians, but clinical features of the mutation phenotype are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed ICAM1 polymorphisms in Korean BD patients to determine if there was an association between particular mutations and clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of ICAM1R241G and ICAM1K469E polymorphisms was determined among 197 patients with BD and 248 healthy controls using BsrG1 and BstU1 PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of both genotypes ICAM1469 * K/ * E and ICAM-1469 * E/ * E was significantly higher in BD patients compared with controls (66.0% vs 52.4%, p=0.004, OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08-1.50) and the allele frequency of ICAM1469 * E was higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (0.41), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (0.41), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (0.43), ocular lesions (0.41) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (0.39) than in controls (0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one heterozygote, ICAM1241G/R, was detected in BD patients but the ICAM1241 * R mutation was not found in any of the 248 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results show that the ICAM1 mutation is associated with BD susceptibility, and is another genetic risk factor for BD among the Korean population </plain></SENT>
