<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of infliximab in patients with inflammatory vascular lesions due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with clinical evidence of severe vascular BD were analyzed: 3 patients with aortic involvement, 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> of the pelvic veins, 1 with recurrent venous and arterial thromboses of the thigh, and 2 with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was initiated with 3-5 mg/kg of body weight and infusions were repeated in intervals of 4 weeks as either first-line therapy in 3 patients or add on after failure of conventional immunosuppression in the remaining 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ongoing immunosuppression consists of a various combination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (n = 2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (n = 3), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (n = 3), and low-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Control of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was seen 1-5 days after infliximab induction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein level was reduced from a mean of 89 mg/liter prior to infliximab to 9 mg/liter thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vision increased rapidly in patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular grafts remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inflamed and dissected aortic wall healed over a period of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infliximab could be stopped in 2 patients; intervals could be extended in 4 to a maximum of 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infliximab and basic immunosuppression were well tolerated; no drug-induced side effects were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab is effective in inducing and maintaining remission of vasculitic activity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rapid effect together with excellent tolerability suggests that infliximab should be considered as a first-line agent in severe vascular BD </plain></SENT>
