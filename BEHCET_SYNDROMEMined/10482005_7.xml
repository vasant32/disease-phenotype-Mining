<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antiendothelial cell antibodies have been detected in the serum from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> with presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and it is assumed that they can induce damage to the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we detected antiendothelial cell antibodies in the serum from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, electrophoresis and immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytolysis of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) was measured using a cytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum from 37.4% of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients showed IgM antibodies against unstimulated HDMEC while the serum from 18.4% of patients showed an increase in IgM antibody titer after IFN-gamma pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was higher in the IgM-positive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients than in the IgM-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Western blotting, IgM-positive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease serum reacted with the 44 kDa HDMEC surface antigen, whereas IgM-positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> serum reacted with the 81 kDa HDMEC surface antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reactivity to the 44 kDa protein band was also observed in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells but not in fibroblasts, A431 cells or SK-MEL-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients incubated with human complement or mononuclear cells produced no significant lysis of HDMEC, and cultured HDMEC were resistant to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that antibodies against antigens on the surface of endothelial cells may play a role in inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, not through a direct toxic effect of an antiendothelial cell antibody but by an indirect effect involving the activation of endothelial cells to produce cytokines </plain></SENT>
