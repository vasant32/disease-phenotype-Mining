<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e> characterized by a relapsing inflammatory process of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is well known that atherothrombosis in systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> is closely related to coagulation and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001939'>metabolism abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate some parameters of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [Lp(a)] and anticardiolipin antibody (ACA) levels and the relationship of these parameters with the clinical activity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty three patients with BD (15 active, 18 inactive cases) and 20 healthy controls participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After performing a detailed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065,C0031809" disease_type="Health Care Activity;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">physical exam</z:e>, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> A and B (apo-A, apo-B), Lp(a), and ACA levels (ACA-IgG and IgM) were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with active BD had higher ESR, CRP and Lp(a) levels, and lower apo-A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels compared with the patients with inactive BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ACA-IgG and IgM levels were higher in patients with active BD than healthy controls but not higher than patients with inactive BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, ACA-IgG level was higher in active and inactive cases with vascular involvement than in those of active and inactive cases without vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the analyses of correlation, in active BD patients we found a positive correlation between CRP and Lp(a) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Lp(a) behaves as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactant and ACA levels are increased in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data from patients with active BD may be compatible with the serum profile, which is accepted as a risk for the development of atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
