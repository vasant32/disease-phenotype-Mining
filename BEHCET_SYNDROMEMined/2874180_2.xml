<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, the frequency of nonrheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR) has apparently increased, accompanied by a decrease in frequency of rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to ascertain the echocardiographic features of nonrheumatic AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We had 24 surgically- or autopsy-proven cases of nonrheumatic AR admitted during a two year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were 10 cases of infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> (IE), five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> of type I, three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e>, and two with prosthetic valve malfunctions, and the remainder five were difficult to diagnose clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These five were three men and two women, whose ages ranged from 40 to 67 years and averaged 50 years, and their final diagnoses were annulo-aortic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> (AAE), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>), and two other cases were of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The echocardiographic manifestations were compared with the operative, autopsy, and pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographically, there were few or no increased intensities of aortic valvular echoes, and aortic roots had a tendency to dilate, leading to the failure of coaptation of valve leaflets, for a relative lack of valvular surface area to cross-sectional area of the aortic ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the five had flail aortic valves and three had associated MVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three were diagnosed as floppy aortic valves at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Excised valves revealed little <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> grossly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fibrinoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or mucoid degeneration were noted by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some specimens of aortic walls also revealed cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or disruption of elastic fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these findings were based on degenerative processes of connective tissue, and not on inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These pathological findings and the coexistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001634'>mitral valve prolapse</z:hpo> (MVP), which were not regarded as coincidental, suggest that connective tissue fragility--congenital or acquired--may play an important role in the genesis of nonrheumatic AR </plain></SENT>
