<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were collected prospectively at 8 tertiary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Safety was analyzed in 63 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was analyzed in 50 patients, after exclusion of those who had received infliximab for various reasons before the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent (56 of 63) of the patients were male, with 70% (44 of 63) of the patients aged 25 to 44 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The safety analysis demonstrated that 34 episodes of adverse effects occurred in 46% (29 of 63) of patients during 1 year, including 3 episodes of infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were deemed serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The efficacy analysis at 1 year showed that uveoretinitis had improved in 69% (33 of 48), had improved somewhat in 23% (11 of 48), was unchanged in 8% (4 of 48), and had worsened in no patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean number of ocular attacks per 6-month period decreased from 2.66 at baseline to 0.44 during months 1 through 6 of infliximab therapy and to 0.79 during months 7 through 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent (21 of 48) of patients had no ocular attacks during the 1-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was best for patients with uveoretinitis duration of less than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution from 0.736 at the first infliximab infusion to 0.616 at the end of 1 year (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab treatment for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease uveoretinitis was well tolerated, with nonserious adverse effects occurring in about half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the end of 1 year, uveoretinitis had improved or improved somewhat in 92% (44 of 48) of patients, accompanied by improvement in the mean visual acuity </plain></SENT>
