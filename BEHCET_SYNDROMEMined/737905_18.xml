<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (44%) were found to have significantly elevated levels of IC (range 56 to 1600 microgram equivalent aliquots of heat aggregated IgG (AHG/ml) by the former test and nine by the latter (7 to 500 microgram equivalent AHG/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of IC showed a significant correlation with disease activity score (P = 0.003, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal values of IC tended to remain abnormal when sera were retested after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between IC and duration of disease or any specific organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IC were found predominantly in fractions of about 19S and greater when fractionated by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density gradient or Sephadex column techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest the possibility that IC may contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
