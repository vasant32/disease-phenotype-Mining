<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic evaluation revealed vacuolization changes of fat cells with detachment of their cell membrane from the basal lamina that permitted lymphocytes and macrophages to enter into this developed space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We believe that the detachment of fat cells from the basal lamina precedes invasion by lymphocytes which, in turn, attracts macrophages into the space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This eventually leads to fat-cell lysis accompanied by activation of macrophages, which causes further <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, completing the picture of <z:mp ids='MP_0011164'>panniculitis</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
