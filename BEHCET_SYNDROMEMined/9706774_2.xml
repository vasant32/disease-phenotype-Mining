<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we have investigated role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic venous outflow obstruction</z:e> in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a 10-year period from November 1986 to December 1996, 1,748 patients with clinical evidence of either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic venous outflow obstruction</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265072" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inferior vena cava obstruction</z:e> without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and 512 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were examined at Hacettepe University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of and the effect of hepatic venous obstruction on the subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case, hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was assessed by hepatic venography and by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and liver biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Coagulation factors, including protein C, protein S, anti-thrombin III, and routine laboratory studies assessing the coagulability of blood were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic venous outflow obstruction</z:e> on the subsequent development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> was determined by periodic laboratory investigations that included alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), ultrasonography, and when indicated liver biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the same time period <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed as having <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> were investigated to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential etiologic factors responsible for the <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five (10.7%) of the 512 patients with BD were found to have one or more large vein thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these 55 (29%) patients had hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> developed in 2 of these 16 patients (12.5%), 34 and 21 months after a diagnosis of hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Forty patients from a total of 1,748 patients with clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, but without BD, were found to have evidence of hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of these 40 patients had an identifiable underlying disorder responsible for their hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite a full clinical and laboratory investigation in the other 19 patients, the etiologic factor responsible for the hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> remained obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only one of these 19 patients, who also had portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, developed <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> during a 9-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, a total of three of the 56 (5.36%) of cases of hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> developed an <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>hepatic tumors</z:mpath> were of the multicentric, nodular, rapidly growing type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, there was no clear-cut histologic evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may be a contributing factor responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we advise that individuals with hepatic vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> should be assessed periodically for the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
