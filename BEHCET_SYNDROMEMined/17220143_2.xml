<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine-stimulating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested to play a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and pathogenesis of vasculitic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: VEGF and CD34 expressions were assessed in samples taken from oral aphthous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated for disease activity, duration of lesions, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (53.9%) had increased CRP levels and 12 (46.1%) had increased ESR levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive VEGF and CD34 staining were detected in 46.2% and 69.2% of biopsy samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was good positive correlation between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of positive VEGF and CD34 staining was statistically higher in lesions with a duration of more than 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between positive VEGF staining and serum CRP level, ESR and disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased VEGF expression in correlation with CD34 positivity in oral aphthous lesions may show the role of VEGF in pathogenesis of these vasculitic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have concluded that VEGF may play a role during the course of oral aphthous lesions in BD </plain></SENT>
