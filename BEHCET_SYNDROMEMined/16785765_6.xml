<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate periodic disturbances in proinflammatory activation of neutrophils and monocytes in patients with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) both during an attack and in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 20 FMF patients, who were naive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment and did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, and 10 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis, respiratory burst, CD11a/CD18 expression and intracellular cytokine synthesis were determined by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endotoxin tolerance induction was defined by a reduced capacity of monocytes to respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) activation following a first exposure to LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients, we observed upregulation of neutrophil and monocyte phagocytic activity and oxidative burst during remission and downregulation of phagocytic activity and stimulus-dependent oxidative burst during an attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparative analysis of oxidative burst has revealed that while the neutrophil population shows a certain periodicity in the increase (during remission) and decrease (during attacks) in the spontaneous and inducible respiratory burst, periodicity in the monocyte population is very poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, LPS-induced oxidative burst and CD11a/CD18 integrin surface expression is higher in patients during an attack compared to patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The induction of homologous tolerance of monocytes to the repeated action of LPS is observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients during an attack, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and patients with BD, whereas monocytes from patients in remission failed to induce LPS homologous tolerance and exhibited heightened sensitivity to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> endotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> is able to restore impaired LPS homologous tolerance induction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients in remission upon increased synthesis of IL-4 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patient monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> is characterized by periodic changes in monocyte and neutrophil activation and heightened sensitivity to endotoxin, which is associated with the episodic nature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased endotoxin sensitivity in the period of remission could result from a shift in the monocyte activation program from 'alternatively' into 'classically' activated monocytes, which may have important implications for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
