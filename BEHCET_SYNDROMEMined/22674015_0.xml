<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current evidence suggests that BS does not easily fit into any one of these lumps, while on occasion, it might be impossible to tell BS from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, especially when the main clinical presentation is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ulceration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are distinct regional differences in disease expression of BS with fewer cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal disease</z:e> in the Mediterranean basin and less severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> and less frequent skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> among patients reported from northern Europe or America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clustering of symptoms, especially with the recently described increased frequency of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> cluster in familial cases, suggests that more than one pathological pathway is involved in what we call BS today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supportive evidence for this contention also comes from the observations that (a) the genetic component is very complex with perhaps different genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo> in the adult and in the pediatric patients; and (b) there are differing organ responses to one same drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, the anti-TNF agents successfully control the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> while they have no effect on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
