<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our institute, between 1981 and 2006, five consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> underwent valve detachment after initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A novel modification of AVR termed 'subannular ring reinforcement technique' was introduced to prevent valve detachment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed AVR with this new manoeuvre in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No prosthetic valve detachment was noted after a mean period of 3+/-1.8 years (range: 1.5-5.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this technique, we put a ring-shaped prosthetic graft in subannular position and sandwiched the aortic valve annulus between the prosthetic valve and graft with vertical mattress sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We consider that the subannular ring may be effective in distributing the stress to the annulus and the vertical mattress suture may help in fixing the prosthesis to annulus tissue rigidly </plain></SENT>
