<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> gene (MEFV) mutations among Palestinian patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 42 BD patients from the West Bank and Jerusalem for most of the MEFV mutations known to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients diagnosed clinically according to the International Study Group (ISG) criteria were recruited from Makassed Islamic Charitable Hospital and private clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed the DNA testing using direct DNA sequencing of exon 10 of the MEFV gene and using the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) technique for mutations located in other exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 40.5% of the samples had nine different MEFV mutations and one polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E148Q was the most prevalent mutation, found in 38.1% of the mutated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>M694V, V726A, M694I, A744S, P369S, R408Q, and F479L were each detected in 4.8% of the mutated alleles studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism P706 was detected in 9.5% of the mutated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutations A744S, P369S, R408Q, and F479L were reported for the first time in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>V722M, a novel MEFV mutation that has not been reported before in either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> or BD patients, was identified in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first genetic analysis of MEFV mutations among Palestinian BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It reflects their mutations profile, providing further data that MEFV mutations are an additional genetic susceptibility factor in BD </plain></SENT>
