<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The isotype of AECA from BD is IgM recognizing 44 kDa antigen (IgM-AECA) of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After stimulation of HDMEC with AECA-positive sera from BD patients, the expression of intercellular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on HDMEC increases significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is one of protein kinase families activated by a wide spectrum of extracellular stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are several subtypes, including extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun NH(2) terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 cascades, and they regulate various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the involvement of MAPK as a signal transduction pathway in the IgM-AECA-induced ICAM-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for detecting the induction of ICAM-1 on HDMEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also examined the production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) or interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) by HDMEC after stimulation with IgM-AECA, and checked the involvement of MAPK by Western blot assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IgM-AECA cocktail from 8 patients with BD induced expression of the ICAM-1 on HDMEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither TNFalpha nor IL-1alpha was detected by ELISA, FACS or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in activated HDMEC cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IgM-AECA cocktail activated ERK1/2 and showed peak activities at 5 min after the stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 inhibited IgM-AECA-induced ERK1/2 activities and ICAM-1 expression on HDMEC at a concentration of 60 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IgM-AECA can play a pathogenic role in induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and inflammatory lesions of BD by directly activating endothelial cells, not by production of TNFalpha or IL-1alpha from HDMEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ERK1/2 are involved in expression of ICAM-1 on HDMEC stimulated with IgM-AECA </plain></SENT>
