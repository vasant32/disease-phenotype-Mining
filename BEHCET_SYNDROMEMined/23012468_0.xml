<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study area consists of three health-care districts with an adult population (≥15 years) of 809 317 on 1 January 2011 (25% of non-Swedish ancestry), situated in Skåne, the southernmost county in Sweden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were identified using clinical registries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the five hospitals within the study area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients fulfilling the International Study Group criteria for diagnosis of BD were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty patients (13 women) fulfilling the diagnosis criteria for BD (70% of non-Swedish ancestry) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The point prevalence of BD on 1 January 2011 was 4.9/100,000 adults (95% CI 3.4, 6.5) and was higher among the population of non-Swedish ancestry (13.6 vs 2.0/100,000, P &lt; 0.001), and higher among men (6.8 vs 3.2/100,000, P = 0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 20 incident cases (diagnosed in Sweden between 1997 and 2010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence rate was 0.2/100,000 adults (95% CI 0.1, 0.3) and was higher among the population of non-Swedish ancestry (0.6 vs 0.1/100,000, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence was 0.3/100,000 adults in men and 0.1/100,000 in women, P = 0.143 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the course of the disease, 100% of the patients developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e>, 80% <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, 88% <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, 53% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e>, 40% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> and 20% <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of BD is higher in Sweden than previously reported, mainly due to immigration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of BD remains elevated for immigrants from high-prevalence regions even long after settling in Sweden </plain></SENT>
