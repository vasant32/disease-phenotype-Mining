<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to define the role of the Th1/Th2 balance in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From February 2003 to August 2005, we studied 31 patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 21 (12 female, 9 male; mean age 35.5 [SD 10] years) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and 10 (7 female, 3 male; mean age 34 [SD 11] years) presented with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> but no prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 10 (7 female, 3 male; mean age 34.7 [SD 8] years) age-matched, healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD4+ CD26+ and CD4+ CD30+ cell surface expression of the peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes was evaluated by analytic flow cytometry in order to determine percentages of Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean percentage of CD4+ CD26+ and CD4+ CD30+ cells was 26.27 (SD 6.18) % and 2.56 (SD 0.82) %, 17.42 (SD 5.90) % and 2.86 (SD 0.72) %, and 14.99 (SD 3.96) % and 3.11 (SD 1.25) % in BD with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, BD with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> but no prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attack, and control groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T-helper 1 (Th1) cell percentage was significantly higher in the BD with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> group than the BD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and no prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> attack group (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With respect to the percentage of CD30+ Th2 cells, there was no statistical difference between the 2 BD groups (p = 0.529) or among the 3 groups (p = 0.375) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Th1 lymphocyte dominance in peripheral circulating blood may play a role in the pathogenesis of BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
