<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight BD patients with active mucocutaneous symptoms were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral health, clinical manifestations and in vitro interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-10 and monocyte chemotactic protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1 responses were evaluated before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of folliculitic lesions, healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and scores of plaque indexes (PLIs) were lower after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> treatment (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scores of PLIs correlated positively with the healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although a trend towards increased stimulated IL-10 responses with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> was observed, no statistically significant difference was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulated and unstimulated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, IFN-gamma and IL-12 responses were similar before and after treatment (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">Azithromycin</z:chebi> was observed to be effective in decreasing folliculitic lesions and fastening the healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
