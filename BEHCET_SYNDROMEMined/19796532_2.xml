<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 189 Italian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD and 210 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors were genotyped for two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms of TLR4 (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) by molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severity score was calculated.RESULTS: The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between the BD patients and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were found when BD patients with and those without clinical manifestations were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association between TLR4 polymorphisms and severity score was observed.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the TLR4 gene polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to, clinical expression of, and severity of BD in Italian patients </plain></SENT>
