<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) is an endothelial cell dysfunction (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) parameter which may also be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to search carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaque formation in BD, using high-resolution B-mode Doppler ultrasonography (USG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 114 BD patients (M/F: 68/46; mean age 38.15 +/- 9.44 years; disease duration 121 +/- 79 months), being followed up by Ege University Rheumatology Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age and sex-matched, 77 healthy controls, and as the disease control group 46 non-matched SLE patients were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the study participants were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the three groups were made by ANOVA and for post-hoc confirmation, Bonferoni test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in BD (mean +/- SD, 0.55 +/- 0.14 mm) was significantly higher than in healthy controls (0.48 +/- 0.09 mm) (p = 0.004), but significantly lower than in SLE (0.66 +/- 0.24 mm) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Likewise, plaque frequency in BD (5/114) was significantly higher than in healthy controls (0/77), but significantly lower than in SLE (8/46) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite significantly higher carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and plaque frequency in BD compared with healthy controls, these parameters in BD were not as marked as in SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Less severe carotid artery abnormalities in BD, may partially explain why <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality do not seem to be increased in BD, unlike in SLE </plain></SENT>
