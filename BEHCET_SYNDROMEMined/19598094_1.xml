<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients who referred to the ophthalmology clinic were included in the study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For parasite detection, 3 eyelashes from each inferior eyelid were epilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized skin surface biopsy (SSSB) was performed for detection of parasite at cheeks of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples were prepared with Hoyer's solution and investigated under the light microscope </plain></SENT>
