<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to describe the pulmonary parenchymal changes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease using high-resolution computed tomography and to correlate them with pulmonary function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (18 men, 16 women), 3 of whom were symptomatic, were included as the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of 34 patients were smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty asymptomatic volunteers (12 men, 8 women), 4 of whom were smokers, constituted the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary function tests and high-resolution computed tomography were performed for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inspiratory high-resolution computed tomography findings were abnormal in nine patients (26.5%) of the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight patients, there were multiple abnormalities, whereas one patient had only one abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264545" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pleural thickening</z:e> and irregularities, major fissure thickening, emphysematous changes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002110'>bronchiectasis</z:hpo>, parenchymal bands, and irregular densities, and parenchymal nodules were the encountered abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inspiratory high-resolution computed tomography scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On expiratory scans, there was statistically significant difference between study group and control group when air trapping, especially grades 3 and 4, was compared (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary function tests of both the study and the control groups were in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups according to pulmonary function tests (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: High-resolution computed tomography is sensitive in the demonstration of pulmonary changes in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>End-expiratory high-resolution computed tomography examination is very useful and necessary to show the presence of air trapping, thus the presence of small airway disease, even if the patient is asymptomatic or has <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pulmonary function tests </plain></SENT>
