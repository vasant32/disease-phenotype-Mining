<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical presentation, the severity and the course of the disease in 86 Moroccan patients according to their HLA-B phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of the B*51 or B*15 did not predispose to a particular clinical manifestation, nor to a more severe presentation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, outcome of the disease significantly differed depending on HLA-B phenotype, with an increase of symptoms in most B*51+ patients and in half of B*15 patients, and a remission or a decrease of symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B*51-B*15- patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This variable course was mostly observed for ocular lesions, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, articular symptoms, and neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data may suggest that treatment should be given early in the course of the disease in B*51 or B*15-positive patients in order to stabilize the inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
