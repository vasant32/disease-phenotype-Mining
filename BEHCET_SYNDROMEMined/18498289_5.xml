<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes encoding these molecules have been associated with autoimmune conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analysed the SNPs -318C/T and 49A/G in CTLA-4 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> and appropriate controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood was collected from 236 patients with BD from the UK and the Middle East (ME), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilling the International Study Group criteria for the diagnosis of BD, and 143 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> were recruited from the Medical Eye Unit at St Thomas' Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Samples from healthy individuals from each geographical centre were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA was prepared by standard methods, and SNPs -318 and 49 in CTLA-4 were detected by a polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) assay using primer mixes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that there was no association with either polymorphism in patients with BD from the UK or the ME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no association in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was no association with SNP in CTLA-4 and disease manifestations in BD or outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> have HLA associations, but there is no difference in distribution of CTLA-4 polymorphisms that are associated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of association with polymorphisms in CTLA-4 and other master controlling genes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> suggests that mechanisms that mediate such a description for BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> have still to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
