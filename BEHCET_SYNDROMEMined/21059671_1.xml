<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have implicated the IL-23/Th-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether IFN-α could affect this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from patients with active BD and controls were cultured alone or with IFN-α and the levels of IL-17 and IL-10 in the supernatants were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments were performed with isolated CD4(+) T cells from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1), p-STAT2, p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 in CD4(+) T cells from controls cultured with or without IFN-α were also evaluated by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an experiment using anti-IL-10 was performed to examine underlying mechanisms of action of IFN-α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of IL-17 and IL-10 were observed in the supernatants of PBMCs from BD patients as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-α significantly decreased IL-17 production by PBMCs from both patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, IFN-α increased IL-10 production by PBMCs from patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar findings were obtained when using CD4(+) T cells from controls, IFN-α significantly increased p-STAT2 expression in control CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-IL-10 antibody was able to neutralize the inhibitory effect of IFN-α on IL-17 by 35% as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In vitro experiments showed that IFN-α could inhibit IL-17 expression and increased IL-10 production by PBMCs and CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory role of IFN-α on IL-17 was partly mediated by IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>IFN-α activity was mediated via STAT2 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
