<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Among 140 patients with BD seen at the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Beirut between 1980 and 2000, 18 (13%) had vascular involvement and were included in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients fulfilled International Study Group criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Men with BD were more likely to have vascular involvement (13/77, 17%) than women (5/63, 8%) (P = 0.12) and were younger at diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (32 +/- 7 vs. 36 +/- 7.5 years; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> at more than one site: 17 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, 10 had arterial thromboses, and one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>Thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> was more common in men (82% vs. 18%; P &lt; 0.03) and <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in women (70% vs. 30%; P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Caval <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> were the most serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> was effective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038833" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior vena cava syndrome</z:e> and extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vascular manifestations of BD are common in Lebanon, particularly venous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> are seen less often than <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
