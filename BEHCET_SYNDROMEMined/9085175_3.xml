<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intrapelvic lymph tract was markedly deformed because of recurrent ileocecal ulceration, and conventional lymphoscintigraphy with a common tracer did not abolish the suspicion that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells may have invaded the lymph nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy with a new tracer, 99mtechnetium-diethylene <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38751">triamine</z:chebi> pentaacetic acid-human serum albumin, because of its high detection sensitivity, was very useful for excluding this suspicion, and for determining the clinical stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combination induction chemotherapy led to complete remission without any adverse effects, but subsequent supportive therapy with same protocol could not be completed because of progression of the intestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Special management for the intestinal lesions, such as bowel rest, may be essential with chemotherapy for patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
