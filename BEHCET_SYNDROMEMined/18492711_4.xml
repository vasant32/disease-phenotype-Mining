<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were 14- and 15-yrs old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both met the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, O'Duffy and the Japanese criteria for the classification or diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement were impaired sensorimotor function of the left arm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> of right arm and leg, dizziness and walking instability in Patient 1, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of both legs, impaired bladder-, bowel- and sexual function in Patient 2 and vasculitic lesions on cranial MRI in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RhIFN-alpha2a was administered initially at 3 million IU/day for 4 weeks followed by 3 x 3 million IU/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in Patient 1 (reduction in BD activity score from 17 to 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 experienced remarkable improvement (reduction of BD activity score from 23 to 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both patients the MRI lesions improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 had mild flu-like symptoms as adverse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RhIFN-alpha2a was effective and well tolerated in these juvenile patients with severe neurological BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding the serious consequences following ocular and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> affection and adverse effects of steroid dependency, administration of rhIFN-alpha2a at an earlier time point needs to be considered </plain></SENT>
