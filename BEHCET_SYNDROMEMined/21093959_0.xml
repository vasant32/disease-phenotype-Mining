<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> is an intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and one of the most severe and frequent manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S antigen (S Ag) is a highly conserved <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> protein implicated in the mechanism of the physiopathology in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This autoantigen is used in different animal models for experimental autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (EAU) development, particularly in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production has been reported in this disease by several groups and mainly by our team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: in this study, we investigated the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in an experimental model using the Wistar rat after treatment with S antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This antigen was isolated and purified from bovine retina by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-200 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rats were immunized with 10μg of S Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the changes in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolite production in plasma using the Griess reaction, during the 7th, 14th, and 21st days post-immunization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, deleterious effects by S antigen on <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> tissue were assessed in a histological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the results showed a significant increase in NO production in Wistar rats treated with S Ag in comparison with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We noted with interest that the clinical stages of EAU correlated with NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, S Ag had several deleterious effects on Wistar rat retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: this study indicated in vivo elevation of NO levels, which was observed before <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> appears to be a good marker for a poor prognosis in this experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> can be considered the primary step in pathogenesis inducing the destruction of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photoreceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data could be helpful in the development of strategies for diagnosing patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
