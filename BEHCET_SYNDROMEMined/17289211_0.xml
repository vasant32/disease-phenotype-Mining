<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmic arterial (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) Doppler signals were recorded from healthy subjects, subjects suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> stenosis, subjects suffering from ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid arterial (ICA) Doppler signals were recorded from healthy subjects, subjects suffering from ICA stenosis, subjects suffering from ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods of combining multiple classifiers with diverse features are viewed as a general problem in various application areas of pattern recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the importance of making the right decision, better classification procedures for Doppler ultrasound signals are searched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the SVMs trained on the extracted features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The research demonstrated that the multiclass SVMs trained on extracted features achieved high accuracy rates </plain></SENT>
