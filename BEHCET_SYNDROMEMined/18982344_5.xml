<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies demonstrate a prevalence of Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (ABD) in the range of 0.12-420 per 100,000 inhabitants, with the highest rates in Istanbul, Turkey, and the lowest rates in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmological data on the prevalence of ocular involvement are limited for ABD in Germany, because most epidemiological studies are based on rheumatological or dermatological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Berlin is the city with the highest number of non-native German inhabitants, and its multi-ethnic character renders it uniquely appropriate for epidemiological studies on ABD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ABD patients seen in our department since 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found 140 patients (63 female, 77 male), with a mean follow-up of 6.4 years (0.5-22 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 23 at the first manifestation and 32 when the full-blown disease was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ocular involvement was 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were of Turkish (n = 73) or German (n = 34) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent developed ocular involvement, which was the first manifestation in 8.6% and the second manifestation in 19.3% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: More than half the patients developed ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The calculated prevalence of ocular involvement in ABD is 1.77/100,000 inhabitants for the municipality of Berlin </plain></SENT>
