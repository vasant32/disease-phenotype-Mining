<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether immunologic abnormalities in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) are related to abnormalities of the Th1/Th2 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Th1/Th2 cytokine production by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 31 patients with BD, 11 patients with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and 10 healthy blood donors was evaluated by intracellular immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels were measured using an enzyme amplified-sensitivity immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) on spontaneous and Fas-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated PBL was evaluated by flow cytometry using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> (PI) staining and a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/PI procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracellular immunofluorescence staining of IL-2, IL-4, and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) in CD3+ lymphocytes from BD patients demonstrated a strong polarization of the immune response toward the Th1 pathway that correlated with the progression of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripheral Th1 cells were significantly increased in patients with active disease (n = 14) as compared with those in patients in complete remission (n = 17), patients with inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum IL-12 levels were correlated with peripheral Th1 lymphocytes and disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic analysis revealed that PHA-activated PBL from patients with active disease were highly sensitive to spontaneous and Fas-mediated activation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, addition of rIL-12 to complete medium prevented this spontaneous and Fas-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and enhanced the proliferation of Th1 lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicate that a strong Th1 immune response occurs in active BD and suggest that IL-12 plays a substantial part in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By preventing spontaneous and Fas-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, in fact, it results in an abnormal growth of autoreactive Th1 lymphocytes that could contribute to the prolonged inflammatory autoimmune condition of BD </plain></SENT>
