<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two clear protein spots were found to be differently expressed between healthy volunteers and patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One was a 53 kDa protein with pI 5.2 that was detected in healthy volunteers but was nearly absent in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other was a 40 kDa protein with pI 5.2 that was detected in the patients but nearly absent in the healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 40 kDa protein revealed that it was a truncated actin with an N-terminus of Met-44 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of the truncated actin in the neutrophils of patients was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody to the C-terminus of actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 53 kDa protein could not be identified because its N-terminus was blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the truncated actin in the neutrophils of the patients may be important in understanding the pathology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
