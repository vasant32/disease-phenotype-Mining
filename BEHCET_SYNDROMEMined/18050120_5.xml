<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) are angiogenic mediators that share a significant proinflammatory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both substances have been suggested to play a key role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed VEGF and IL-8 levels in the aqueous humor and serum of patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> during a quiet phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease</z:e>, Fuchs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> syndrome, idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, as well as 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> matched subjects, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VEGF and IL-8 concentrations were measured in aqueous humor and serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF levels were significantly higher in both the aqueous humor and serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-8 concentrations in aqueous humor were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> with extraocular manifestations than in those with eye-limited disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that VEGF plays a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> pathogenesis even during inactive disease and that IL-8 levels are significantly influenced by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>-associated extraocular changes </plain></SENT>
