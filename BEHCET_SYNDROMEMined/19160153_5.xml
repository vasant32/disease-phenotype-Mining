<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated their colonoscopic features and identified simple and valuable strategies for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2006, 250 consecutive patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> on colonoscopy (115 Behçet's, 135 Crohn's cases) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease or of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Research Committee of Japan, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was confirmed by clinicopathological data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomly allocated to a training set (70 %) or a validation set (30 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>Ulcer</z:mpath> shapes, distributions, numbers, margins, and border contours, and the presence of aphthous, cobblestone, perianal, and strictured lesions were compared, in the training set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, using the X2-test and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a classification and regression tree (CART) was then used to generate simplified algorithms for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Round shape, five or fewer in number, focal distributions, and absence of aphthous and cobblestone lesions were significantly dominant features in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, according to multivariate analysis of the training set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CART-generated algorithms proposed sequential use of shape (round, irregular/geographic, or longitudinal) and distribution (focal single/focal multiple, or segmental/diffuse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the validation set produced sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of 94.3 %, 90.0 %, 94.7 %, and 89.2 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Using the CART model, we made the correct diagnosis of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in 69 of 75 patients (92 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It was determined that round and longitudinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> are suggestive of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Irregular/geographic-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and focal distributions are suggestive of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, while segmental/diffuse lesions suggest Crohn's </plain></SENT>
