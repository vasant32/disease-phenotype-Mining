<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary lesions associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are rare and reported to have a prevalence of 1.0-7.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, 29 patients aged 16-60 years (mean +/- s: 34 +/- 10.5) were investigated for pulmonary involvement with direct radiography, computerized tomography (CT) and intravenous digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lung scintigraphy was also performed to determine its diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients had a fibreoptic bronchoscopic examination, spirometric test, <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> diffusion test and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6804">methacholine</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 29 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 17 had pulmonary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria for pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and tracheobronchial tree involvement were: (1) hilar vascular prominence or mass, new alveolar and reticulonodular infiltrates on chest X-ray; (2) aphthous lesions, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> ulcerations, inflamed mucosal appearance on bronchoscopy; (3) vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on CT; (4) occlusion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the main pulmonary arteries or its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value of lung scintigraphy and its correlation with other imaging modalities were investigated to determine if a lung perfusion scan alone can be used to detect pulmonary involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were investigated with lung scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of 14 patients with lung involvement were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perfusion lung scintigraphy provided true diagnostic information in 96% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In eight patients without pulmonary involvement, the lung scans were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although DSA specifically demonstrates pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, it involves administration of contrast media and cannot show abnormalities distal to the third pulmonary arterial branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009326" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen disorders</z:e> is physiologically indistinguishable from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>, most perfusion defects resolve within 3 months, which can be used as a differential diagnostic criterion in the appropriate clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, pulmonary perfusion imaging can be used to screen patients suspected of having lung involvement, especially in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, a repeat examination at 3 months is recommended to differentiate pulmonary involvement from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
