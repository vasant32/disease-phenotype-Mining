<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, 18 patients with other forms of noninfectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, 9 patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage due to photocoagulation as well as 18 healthy donors were evaluated for antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses to alpha tropomyosin and its derivative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proliferative responses of PBMCs to these antigens were studied using (3)H <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum samples were also screened by ELISA for autoantibodies against tropomyosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the 18 (33%) BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> showed increased proliferative response to alpha tropomyosin or its derivative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, while none of the healthy, disease controls were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean lymphoproliferative responses to tropomyosin were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.02) in the BD patients compared to healthy or disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher titres of anti-tropomyosin antibodies were also seen in four of the 18 BD patients but none in the healthy or disease control groups (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of these abnormalities supports a possible role for alpha tropomyosin as a self-antigen in a subset of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
