<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we carried out immunohistological examination of biopsied or autopsied brain tissues from 3 patients with different types of NB, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NB, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive NB, and NB in a long-term remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathology of mass lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> NB revealed infiltration of mononuclear cells around small vessels, consisting of CD45RO+ T lymphocytes and CD68+ monocytes with few CD20+ B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of interest, TUNNEL staining disclosed that most neurons were undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the inflammatory lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> progressive NB, similar histopathological changes were noted in pons, cerebellum, medulla, internal capsule, and midbrain, although the degree of mononuclear cell infiltration was modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also scattered foci of neurons undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with formation of a few binucleated neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most prominent feature of NB in a long-term remission was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of basal pons with formation of cystic or moth-eaten lesions, consisting of isomorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> with viable neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were still scattered foci of perivascular cuffing of T lymphocytes and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the common features throughout the courses of NB, perivascular cuffing of T lymphocytes and monocytes, irrespective of the clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More importantly, it is suggested that soluble factors produced by infiltrating cells, including IL-6, might play a role in the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of neurons in NB </plain></SENT>
