<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) is produced in increased amounts in inflammatory conditions and may cause tissue injury by reacting with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> to yield <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, a powerful toxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) scavenges <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and inhibits the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, thereby suppressing the resulting injury and regulating the bioavailability of NO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study to assess serum NO and SOD in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and correlate their levels with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum NO concentrations and SOD activities were determined in 25 BD patients (mean age: 36 years; male/female: 13/12) and in 15 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BD patients were allocated into two groups according to disease activity (active/inactive: 11/14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with active disease, NO levels were found to be significantly elevated, while SOD activities were comparable to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, patients with inactive disease exhibited markedly high SOD activities and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a positive correlation between SOD activity and NO levels in patients with inactive BD (r = 0.562, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We propose that NO-associated injury of tissues, particularly the endothelium, may be important in the etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in BD, and SOD may play a protective role against <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
