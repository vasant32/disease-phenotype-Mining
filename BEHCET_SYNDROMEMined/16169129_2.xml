<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ocular affection is one of the major criteria of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to specify the clinical, therapeutical characteristics and the prognosis factors of the ocular affection in patients having BD and admitted to the dermatology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: It is a retrospective investigation carried out in the dermatology department of Ibn Rochd university hospital center of Casablanca, Morroco, from Jannuary 1990 until December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patient groups have been distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first one involved 50 patients (44,2%) having BD with ocular affection, and the second group involved 63 patients having BD without ocular affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 29 +/- 8 years in the first group VS 30 +/- 7,9 years in the 2(nd) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ocular affection was more frequent in males than in females (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ocular manifestations were marked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031129" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periphlebitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the cutaneomucosal and joint manifestations was similar in both groups, whereas neurologic and vascular with ocular affections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The choice of the treatment depended on the type of ocular affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evolution was marked by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in 6 patients (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The ocular affection comes second after the cutanous mucuous affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Males are more clearly affected than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This allows saying that there is a marked effect of the sexual hormones on the ocular affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Age is not predictive of this ocular affection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The ocular affection was severe in our series and was dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and vascularitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="?"><plain>We insist on the severity of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet and its evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Risk toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> especially concerning young man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Currently, the treatment is not codified; however, the encouraging outcome obtained with some immunosuppressive therapies would be better if this treatment was set up early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study enebed us to re-examine the ocular manifestations of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease in the Maroccan population by the means of a consultation of Dermatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Il should be noted that it is worse forecast because on the one hand of its frequent association to vascular and neurological affections and other share of the delay of consultation noted at the majority of our patients </plain></SENT>
