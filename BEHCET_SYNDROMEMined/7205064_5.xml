<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The antigenic cross-reactions of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> precipitates were studied by coating a plastic tube with one complex and adding another 125I-labeled complex in dissociating (acid) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On neutralization, partial reassembly occurred with the complex coating the tube wall, thus indicating cross-reaction with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first 30 complexes studied, the cross-reactions obtained were sorted by computer program into two mutually exclusive subsets of reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two similar homologous subsets of reactions were found in the second group of 29 patients: in total, nine out of 16 ocular, four out of six herpetiform circulating immune complexes in one subset, and four out of seven neurological in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A wider pattern of reaction could be detected in addition, which induced most of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immune complexes from control sera did not cross-react </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An exogenous agent could account for the circulating immune complexes' cross-reactions for the group as a whole, and two antigenic determinants of that agent or antigens from different damaged tissues explain the subsets </plain></SENT>
