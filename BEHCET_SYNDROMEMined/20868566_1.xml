<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To analyse the clinical manifestations and severity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) in Korea according to geographic region of residence, and to identify risk factors associated with clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 246 BD patients (88 males) who fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were assigned into two groups: a Western group comprising 127 residents in west regions and an Eastern group comprising 119 residents of the SoBaek Mountains situated in the center of Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical severity was assessed using a severity scoring index of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD patients from the Western group had a greater prevalence of typical <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, posterior/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> than did the Eastern group (p&lt;0.001, p=0.009, p=0.032, and p=0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Western group also had higher severity scores than did the Eastern group (5.88±2.5 for the Western group vs. 4.94±2.6 for the Eastern group, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male BD patients had higher severity scores than did female patients (6.14±2.8 vs. 5.03±2.4, p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease duration of BD in the Western group showed a significant association with total severity scores (r=0231, p=0.009), but this was not observed for the Eastern group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found distinct differences in the clinical manifestations as well as severity of BD according to geographic region in Korean BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Males, particularly those from the Western region of Korea, had significantly higher severity scores than did females </plain></SENT>
