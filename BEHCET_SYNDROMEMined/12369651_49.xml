<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five BD patients (25 in active stage) were investigated with ELISA for estimation of cytokines levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytokines intracellular synthesis (IL-4 and IFN-gamma) of CD4+ T cells was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active and in remission BD patients showed increased serum levels of Th1 (IFN-gamma, IL-12) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Active BD was characterized by a higher increase of IL-6, IL-10 and a striking increase of IL-17, IL-18 and IFN-gamma, compared to remission RD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon in vitro stimulation, the percentages of CD4+ T cells containing IFN-gamma and CD40L were higher in active BD compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the microenvironment of CD4+ T cells in active BD may induce the production of more cells committed to Th1 than in BD patients in remission and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
