<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study on 108 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of retina admitted in the ophthalmology department, for a 5-year period (1987-1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our patients had a complete ophthalmological examination : fluorescine angiography, colour vision, general examination and biological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Many aetiologies have been found, predominantly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neovascularization of retina which complicates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was detected in 30 % of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A laser photocoagulation was performed on these cases, sometimes a vitrectomy was necessary when a haemorrhage of vitreous body occurred, complicating the neo-vessels of retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The therapeutics received by our patients was based on the corticotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An immunosuppression treatment was prescribed in most cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome after treatment has been satisfactory, but many patients relapse very frequently, mainly those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Causes of vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> are variable, most of them are due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
