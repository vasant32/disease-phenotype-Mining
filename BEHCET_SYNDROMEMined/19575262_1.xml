<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the exact etiology of systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is still unknown, many hypotheses have been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of these hypotheses is that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, vitamin B(12), and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> of BD patients with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five BD patients, 47 <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients, and 69 healty control subjects were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vitamin B(12), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels of the patients and controls were measured, and statistical differences among the groups were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD patients had mostly cutaneous symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> and ocular and vascular involvement were seen in 24.4%, 22%, and 11% of BD patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was detected among the groups in the levels of vitamin B(12), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in any parameters according to sex and age of the patients and activity of BD and if the patients with BD were treated or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> level inversely correlated with vitamin B(12) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> levels in the BD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We could not find any differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, vitamin B(12), and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> levels between BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be due to the fact that our patients mostly had cutaneous symptoms rather than vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
