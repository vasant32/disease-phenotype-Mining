<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FA and ICGA were performed on 112 eyes of 62 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, between November 1993 and July 2002, using Topcon IMAGEnet Digital System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were aged 16-50 years; 48 (77.4%) were male and 14 (22.6%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FA showed dye leakage from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels in 57 (50.9%) eyes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular oedema</z:hpo> in 18 eyes (16.1%), optic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> in four eyes (3.6%), disc neovascularisation in three eyes (2.7%), and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> neovascularisation in two eyes (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICGA showed hyperfluorescent lesions in 40 eyes (35.7%), hypofluorescent lesions in 17 eyes (15.2%), hyperfluorescent and hypofluorescent lesions in 12 (10.7%) eyes, ICG leakage from choroidal vessels in 11 eyes (9.8%), irregular filling of choriocapillaris in five eyes (4.5%), and choroidal filling defect in four eyes (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hyperfluorescent and hypofluorescent lesions which were seen in 53 out of 69 eyes (76.8%) on ICGA, were not visible on FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>55 eyes (49.1%) showed hyperfluorescence on the disc on both FA and ICGA, whereas 36 (32.1%) showed hyperfluorescence only on FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The hyperfluorescence and/or hypofluorescence, irregular filling of the choriocapillaris, choroidal filling defect, and ICG leakage from choroidal vessels seen only on ICGA may suggest choroidal involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
