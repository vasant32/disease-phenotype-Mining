<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied killer inhibitory receptor (KIR) expression in 40 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD94 and CD158b expression of NK cells was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in a great majority of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NKB1 expression was reduced in eight and increased in six </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some had reduced NKB1 and enhanced CD158a expression simultaneously, or enhanced NKB1 and reduced CD158a simultaneously, suggesting a skewed NK cell repertoire in BD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may result from genetic predisposition, or certain viruses may affect the KIR repertoire formation in BD patients </plain></SENT>
