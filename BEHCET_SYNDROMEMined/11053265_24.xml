<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is known to be associated with HLA-B51 in many ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pathogenic gene responsible for BD is as yet unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To localize the critical region of the pathogenic gene, microsatellite markers distributed around the HLA-B gene were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The BD patients studied were of three ethnic origins: Japanese, Greek, or Italian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The total group consisted of 172 BD patients, of whom were 95 Japanese, 55 Greek, and 22 Italian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight polymorphic microsatellite markers distributed within 1100 kb of the HLA-B gene were analyzed using PCR and subsequent automated fragment detection by fluorescent-based technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the eight markers, allele 348 of the MIB microsatellite was remarkably common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three BD populations (Japanese, PC: = 0.000014; Greek, PC: = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>00047; Italian, PC: = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, HLA-B51 was found to be the marker most strongly associated with BD in each population (Japanese, PC: = 0.000000000017; Greek, PC: = 0.00000032; Italian, PC: = 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0074) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In genotypic differentiation between the patients and controls, only HLA-B51 was found to be significantly associated with BD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis suggested that significant associations of BD with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> and other microsatellites resulted from a linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the pathogenic gene of BD is HLA-B51 itself and not other genes located in the vicinity of HLA-B </plain></SENT>
