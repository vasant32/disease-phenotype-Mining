<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated but the etiology is accepted to be multifactorial, therefore the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> continues to be a major therapeutic challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of these disorders is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin (CT), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25905">peptide hormone</z:chebi> secreted in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003072'>hypercalcemia</z:hpo>, has the dual effect of inhibiting osteoclast recruitment as well as their resorptive activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of reviews have concluded that salmon calcitonin is safe and effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcitonin abrogated the stimulating effect of RANKL or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>; similar results were obtained with OPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> activity of salmon calcitonin has been shown in several controlled prospective double-blind studies to improve pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exogenous calcitonin is thought to cross the blood-brain barrier and to accumulate slowly in the brain, inducing <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> once sufficient receptors are occupied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since CT could antagonize resorptive and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> activity by competitively binding to CTR and has been considered as a specific <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, we postulate that the CT could function as a novel agent to inhibit BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, if the hypothesis proved to be practical, CT could be widely used in clinical settings to treat BD </plain></SENT>
