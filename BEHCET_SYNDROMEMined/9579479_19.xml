<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two patients with BD (32 with active and 20 with inactive BD) and 33 healthy control subjects were the subjects in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were or were not treated with immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular cytokines in combination with cell surface markers CD4 and CD8 for flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In nontreated patients with BD, the frequencies of IL-2- and IFN-gamma-producing CD4 and CD8+ cells in active patients were significantly higher than those in inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the frequencies of IL-4 producing CD4+ and CD8+ cells in nontreated patients with active BD were comparable with those in patients with inactive disease and in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with inactive BD who were treated with immunosuppressive drugs showed significantly lower frequencies of IL-2- and IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ cells than did treated patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of type 1 cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ cells increased in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effective immunosuppressive treatments decreased the population of type 1 cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that type 1 cytokine-producing cells play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
