<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied neutrophil functions in patients with BD in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase in comparison with healthy control subjects and with the same patients during disease remission, with or without therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated in vivo neutrophil migration by Senn's skin window technique and measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> assay and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production in circulating and migrating neutrophils after different stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neutrophil migration in vivo was 101.3 +/- 17.9 x 10(6) polymorphonuclear lymphocytes (PMN)/cm2/24 h in patients with BD in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and 66.1 +/- 7.8 x 10(6) PMN/cm2/24 h in controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between leukocyte counts and neutrophil migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil migration evaluated in the same patients in a phase of disease remission was 58.3 +/- 10.3 x 10(6) PMN/cm2/24 h (p &lt; 0.001 vs <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, not significant vs controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neutrophils of the exudate were normally primed to response to the chemotactic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences between the 2 groups were found in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> under basal conditions, or in response to different stimuli by circulating and migrating neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Abnormally high migration of neutrophils in the active phase of BD is the only consistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since this modification is reversed by therapy, the evaluation of in vivo neutrophil migration may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood neutrophils have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses to different stimuli, indicating they are not primed by the disease state </plain></SENT>
