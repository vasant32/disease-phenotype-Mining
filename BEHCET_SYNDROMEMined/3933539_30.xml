<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have attempted to detect deposits of immune complexes and to analyse cytological reactions in the aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN)-like eruptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deposits of IgM and positive fluorescence of anti-streptococcal group D serum were found in vessel walls and sites infiltrated by inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytological analysis has revealed that the inflammatory infiltrating cells are mainly composed of activated T-cells and macrophages in association with natural killer cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that DH reactions with antigen-antibody mediated cytotoxicity may play an important role in causing the lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
