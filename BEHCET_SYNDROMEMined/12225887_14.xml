<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High numbers of gammadelta T cells, predominantly Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, were only detected in the IOF-derived TCL of three BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas no TCL responded to heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) 65 kDa, reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30359">isopentyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (IPP) and related non-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> prenyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphates</z:chebi> (PPP) was restricted to the gammadelta T cell containing TCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon IPP stimulation, these TCL secreted IFN-gamma but no IL-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By single-cell analysis of intracellular IFN-gamma production and CD69 expression the IOF-derived IPP-specific T cells were identified as CD4(-)CD8(-) gammadelta T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data presented suggest the infiltration of PPP-specific Vgamma9Vdelta2 Th1-like cells into the eye of BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
