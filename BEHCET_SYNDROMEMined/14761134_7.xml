<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although many studies have been published since its discovery in 1937, the etiopathogenesis of this unique disorder is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between stress factors, psychological and somatic symptoms, and coping mechanisms in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 43 control subjects were compared by using sociodemographic data collection forms, a psychosocial and environmental problems list, the Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>Anxiety</z:hpo> Inventory (BAI), Hamilton <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (70.6%) defined stress factors in the first stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (79.4%) out of 34 patients stated that the recurrence period of the disease was related to the stress factors </plain></SENT>
