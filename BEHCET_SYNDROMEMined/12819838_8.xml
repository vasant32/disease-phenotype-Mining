<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed a hyperintense lesion in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesion was slightly hyperintense on DWI and the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) was slightly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten months later, DWI showed an improvement in the abnormal signal intensity and the region of increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> had increased in size, especially on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DWI is useful for differentiating an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exacerbation of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction </plain></SENT>
