<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to specify the frequency of macular alterations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and discuss the clinical, physiopathological and therapeutic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our report is based on 244 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease examined between January 1995 and December 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors studied macular alterations in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> affecting 108 out of 432 eyes (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean progression of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in these cases was 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was&lt;or=2/10e in 48 eyes (44.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Maculopathy</z:e> was bilateral in 39 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was the most frequently noted form in 62% of the eyes, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> (17%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011508'>macular hole</z:hpo> (3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is the most frequent sign and complication arising from the macular area during <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, which can evolve into cystoid degenerescence and occasionally <z:hpo ids='HP_0011508'>macular hole</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Macular lesions are often irreversible, making prognosis uncertain, despite the various treatments available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Macular damage is the major cause of visual morbidity in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and should be systematically sought </plain></SENT>
