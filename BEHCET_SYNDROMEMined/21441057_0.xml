<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the international BD study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ELISA and real-time PCR were performed to measure α-defensin-1 protein level in the sera and α-defensin-1 mRNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The α-defensin-1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in BD patients (n=59) than HC (n=34) (0.49±0.10 vs. 0.19±0.45, P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of α-defensin-1 mRNA and protein was significantly higher in active patients than inactive patients (n=15, 0.91±0.28 vs. n=44, 0.35±0.09, P&lt;0.001 and n=21, 7.50±2.14ng/ml vs. n=50, 3.32±0.96ng/ml, P=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of α-defensin-1 mRNA was significant higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (n=20) than those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (n=39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: α-defensin-1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly increased in BD patients, especially in active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, α-defensin-1 mRNA is over-expressed in the PBMC of BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that α-defensin-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of BD and can be used as valuable biologic marker for estimation of disease activity in BD </plain></SENT>
