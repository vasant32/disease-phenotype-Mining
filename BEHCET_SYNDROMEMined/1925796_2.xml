<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: Focal lesions were detected in 17 (73.9%) and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was depicted in 10 (43.4%) out of the 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This ratio was higher than X-ray CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase lesions detected by MRI at the first medical examination were diminished after the treatment in proportion to the improvement of the clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow study and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism study by PET were performed on patients whose main problems were mental symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were decreased in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MRI is a useful technique for detecting the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system lesions of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and monitoring its clinical status and therapeutic response for this disease, and PET provides a useful way of understanding the haemocirculatory and metabolic aspects of this disease </plain></SENT>
