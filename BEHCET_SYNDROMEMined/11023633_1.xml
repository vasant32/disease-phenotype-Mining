<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Micturitional disturbance is known to occur in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its pathophysiology is uncertain and few data are available concerning urodynamic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our findings on micturitional histories and urodynamic studies in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A history of urinary symptoms was obtained from nine patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> [seven male, two female, aged 26 to 54 years; mean, 41 years] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological and CT/MRI findings indicated that their lesions were located mainly in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem and the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients underwent urodynamic studies, including measurement of post-micturition residuals, urethral pressure profilometry and EMG cystometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the nine patients (67%) had urinary symptoms that included diurnal urinary frequency in five, sensation of urgency in five, urge <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> in five, voiding difficulty in five and nocturnal urinary frequency in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urodynamic studies performed in six patients showed post-micturition residuals in five (50-180 ml), increased maximum urethral closure pressure in two, decrease in four and increase in one of bladder capacities, detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> in five, decreased bladder sensation in one, brisk bulbocavernosus reflex in four, detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo> in two and neurogenic sphincter EMG in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that micturitional disturbance is not rare in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supranuclear pelvic nerve dysfunction seems to be mainly responsible for the disturbance </plain></SENT>
