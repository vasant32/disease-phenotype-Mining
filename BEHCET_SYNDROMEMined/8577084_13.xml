<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD was found in 7.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases with a male:female ratio of 1.29:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete type of the disease was observed in 50% of the children </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> alone or in combination with other major symptoms was the presenting sign in a higher percentage of children (P=0.077), As in adults, in children diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was the most common type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo>, while ocular complications have been found mainly in children (P=0.021), who more frequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">maculopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
