<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have shown the immunomodulatory effect of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) through down-regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression in human monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the implication of innate immunity with the role of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> affecting TLR expression in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), we focused on the association between the TLR expression and the serum <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> concentration in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of TLR2, TLR4 and CD16 on monocytes was detected by flow cytometric analysis and RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were measured in the patients with BD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> and healthy controls, and then the expression of TLRs was correlated with the value of serum 25(OH)D levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess the influence of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) on expression and function of TLRs in vitro, human monocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of 1,25<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi>(2)D(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the monocytes of active BD patients showed higher expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 than those of controls, and serum 25(OH)D levels tended to be lower in active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with the expressions of TLR2, TLR4 and clinical indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3) was found to dose-dependently suppress the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha synthesis was also decreased upon TLR ligand stimulation in <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>(3)-treated monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> triggered through TLR2 and TLR4 is important in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And it seems possible that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may be used as a therapeutic option by modulating TLR2 and TLR4 expression of monocytes in BD </plain></SENT>
