<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether antilymphocyte Abs to T cell costimulatory molecules are generated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and, if they exist, to clarify the mechanism of their production and pathological roles, we investigated the presence of autoantibodies to CTLA-4 (CD152), CD28, B7-1 (CD80), and B7-2 (CD86) in serum samples obtained from patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects using recombinant fusion proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In ELISAs, anti-CD28, anti-B7-1, and anti-B7-2 Abs were rarely seen, whereas anti-CTLA-4 Abs were detected in 8.2% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 18.8% of those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, 3.1% of those with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, 31.8% of those with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 13.3% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e>, and 0% of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This reactivity was confirmed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the purified anti-CTLA-4 Abs reacted with CTLA-4 expressed on P815 cells by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found at least three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> on the CTLA-4 molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, among the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was seen significantly less frequently in the anti-CTLA-4 Ab-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken collectively, these data indicate that anti-CTLA-4 autoantibodies are generated in systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> by an Ag-driven mechanism and may modulate the immune response in vivo by binding to CTLA-4 on T cells </plain></SENT>
