<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly purified T cells from 32 BD patients, from 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients and from 14 healthy individuals were cultured with various concentrations of Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) B and C1 in the presence of monocytes for 5 days, after which the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High concentrations of SE (1 ng/ml) stimulated BD T cells as well as control T cells to produce comparably high amounts of IFN-gamma, whereas low concentrations of SE (1 pg/ml) stimulated BD T cells much more effectively than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or RA T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypersensitivity of BD T cells to low concentrations of SEC1 was restored with RA monocytes instead of BD monocytes, whereas BD monocytes could not elicit the SEC1-induced IFN-gamma production of RA T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there were no significant differences between BD T cells and RA T cells in monocyte-independent IFN-gamma production stimulated with low or high concentrations of immobilized anti-CD3, or in the monocyte-mediated enhancement of IFN-gamma production stimulated with a low concentration of immobilized anti-CD3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that T cell hypersensitivity is not confined to certain specific antigens in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the data strongly suggest that abnormalities in signal transduction triggered by perturbation of T cell receptors, but not in that induced by cross-linking of CD3 molecules nor in that delivered through costimulation molecules, play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
