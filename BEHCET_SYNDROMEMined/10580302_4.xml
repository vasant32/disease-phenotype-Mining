<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 71 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and 26 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HRV was measured by power spectral analysis in supine and standing position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In supine position, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients had increased low frequency component in absolute (LF) and normalized units (LF nU) but had lower values of high frequency component in absolute (HF) and normalized units (HF nU) than the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In standing position, higher values were obtained in LF and LF nU but lower values of HF and HF nU in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients than controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LF/HF was significantly higher in patients both in supine (2.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.8, P = 0.001) and standing (21.9 +/- 7 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3, P &lt; 0.001) positions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may have asymptomatic ANS dysfunction, which is in the form of increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic modulation, and power spectral analysis of HRV is beneficial in assessing the ANS function </plain></SENT>
