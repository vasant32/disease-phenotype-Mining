<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical characteristics and evolution of a series of adult patients hospitalized for neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (NBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted for NBD in a teaching hospital were retrospectively selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disability at discharge and during follow-up was graded with the modified Rankin Scale, and outcome classified as good or poor (grades 3-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients were included (M/F, 13/7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at NBD diagnosis was 36.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had other manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease (BD) before NBD developed, but only 7 met the complete diagnostic criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> were each present in approximately 60% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a low prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> (5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (5%), and sphincter <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> (0%), and a relatively high prevalence of meningism (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Non-neurologic manifestations of BD were concurrently detected in 15 patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>80% had parenchymal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain biopsies during 5 attacks showed perivascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262091" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic infiltration</z:e> with reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo>, but no frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 6.3 years per patient, 12 had at least one relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In total, there were 22 relapses; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two were in the same location and were symptomatically similar in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, 7 patients (35%) had a poor outcome, including 4 who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recording of previous manifestations of BD and a physical examination to detect concomitant systemic manifestations of BD may help establish an early diagnosis of NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Relapses frequently occurred in the same location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> was present in brain biopsies </plain></SENT>
