<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio is reported from 5.37 to 1 (Egypt), to 0.38 to 1 (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If in the majority of reports BD was seen more frequently in men, in some others it was more frequent in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine a large cohort of patients, in whom manifestations were gender related, and to examine the strength of associations and their clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS:   <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients of the BD registry, Rheumatology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, entered the study (6702 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of 95 items was calculated in both genders (with their 95% confidence intervals), and were compared together by the chi-squared test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Forty-three out of 95 items were gender-related (29 for males, 14 for females) with a statistically significant difference by chi-squared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant OR (confidence interval not reaching 1) was found for 79 items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, clinically significant OR (2 or more for men and 0.5 or less for women) showed an association only with 16 items; five with females and 11 with males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most important was vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:   No strong association (OR of 2 or more) was found between the male gender and major organ involvement, except for vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
