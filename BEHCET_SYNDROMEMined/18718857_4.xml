<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is produced in vivo from the <z:chebi fb="94" ids="33709">aminoacid</z:chebi> l-arginine by a family of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthases (NOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endothelial NOS (eNOS) is a constitutively expressed isoform of NOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The eNOS gene entails several polymorphisms, of which certain were investigated in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We sought to establish the association of eNOS gene Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 with susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, 135 Tunisian patients with BD and 157 healthy blood donor controls from the same geographic area were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction technique for eNOS polymorphism in exon 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the distribution of the Glu298Asp genotype differed between BD patients and controls but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Allele Asp298 was significantly more frequent in healthy controls than in BD patients (p = 0.037, chi(2) = 4.33, OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.41-1.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference was found (p = 0.004, OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 2.13-3.62) between BD patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and patients without this manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that Glu298Asp polymorphism of eNOS gene is associated with BD susceptibility as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
