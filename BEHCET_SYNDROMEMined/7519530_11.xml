<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential pathogenicity of eight <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and two controls was assessed by administering the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in enriched Freund's adjuvant into the footpads of male Lewis rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A few of the rats also showed evidence of focal loss of photoreceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that selected <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> within heat shock protein 60 kD which function as T cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are capable of inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This supports the view that the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> T cell determinants may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
