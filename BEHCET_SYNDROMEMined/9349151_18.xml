<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS/BACKGROUND: While a primary association of HLA-B51 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in Japanese and Mediterranean patients supports an immunogenetic predisposition, this link is unclear in north western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed HLA associations with BD, and HLA-B51 with certain clinical characteristics, in the Republic of Ireland, which has an ethnically homogeneous population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR typing was performed in 24 BD patients, conforming to International Study Group criteria, and in blood donors, as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient records were retrospectively reviewed and patients reassessed clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A highly significant HLA-B51 association (corrected exact p value = 0.002, relative risk = 6.3) with BD was determined, despite a low B51 prevalence (25%) in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other HLA type was associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant B51 link with male sex in BD patients but no association with age at first manifestation/diagnosis, eye involvement, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> therapy, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>poor visual acuity</z:hpo> was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study supports a HLA-B51 immunogenetic predisposition, similar to Japanese patients, in Irish BD in an ethnically homogeneous population in north western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, owing to a low prevalence of B51 positivity in BD patients in Ireland, a multifactorial pathogenesis is suggested </plain></SENT>
