<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo> and the pathogenesis of BD has not yet been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible relation of the periodontal scores and single nucleotide polymorphism of TNF-alpha-1031T/C with BD compared with healthy controls (HC) and recurrent aphtous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also sought to determine the effects of periodontal condition and TNF-alpha-1031T/C polymorphism on clinical severity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-two unrelated patients with BD, 42 <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients and 77 HC were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periodontal status of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was evaluated according to the World Health Organization community periodontal index of treatment needs (CPITN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For genotyping, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean CPITN was observed to be higher in patients with BD compared with HC and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha-1031C allele was significantly higher in patients with BD (P = 0.023) and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P = 0.007) compared with HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean CPITN was higher in CC genotype compared with other genotypes (P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CPITN and CC genotype was found to be correlated with the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the TNF-alpha-1031T/C gene polymorphism (CC genotype) is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000704'>periodontitis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and BD patients and also suggests that long-term periodontal follow-up and education of oral hygiene in patients with BD may help to prevent the development and/or progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
