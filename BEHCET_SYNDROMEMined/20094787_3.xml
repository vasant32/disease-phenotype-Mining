<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical and surgical features of free bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> and to determine the risk factors associated with this complication in intestinal BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 129 patients with intestinal BD treated from September 1988 to September 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 33 patients had intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent emergent or elective laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients with bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was 34.8 ± 15.6 years (range 12-70 years) with a sex ratio of 2.3:1 (male:female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven (81.8%) patients were diagnosed with intestinal BD preoperatively, whereas six (18.2%) patients were diagnosed by pathological examination after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (42.4%) patients experienced postoperative recurrence of intestinal BD and 11 (33.3%) underwent reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis identified younger age (≤ 25 years) at diagnosis (HR = 3.25; 95% CI, 1.41-7.48, p = 0.006), history of prior laparotomy (HR = 5.53; 95% CI, 2.25-13.56, p = 0.0001), and volcano-shaped <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> (HR = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.14-7.08, p = 0.025) as independent risk factors for free bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> in intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of our study, patients diagnosed with intestinal BD younger than 25 years, who had a history of prior laparotomy or volcano-shaped <z:mp ids='MP_0000512'>intestinal ulcers</z:mp> have an increased risk of free bowel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
