<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> is associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from 41 patients with BD and from 40 age- and sex-matched controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An ELISA assay was used to detect antibodies against parvovirus B19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients with BD (15.7%) had anti-B19 IgM antibodies in their serum samples indicating a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, while no positivity for IgM antibodies was detected in the control group (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there have been several reports of B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, our findings do not strongly support the involvement of B19 in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serological evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 6 BD patients may be purely coincidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also no positive correlation with the articular and vascular manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
