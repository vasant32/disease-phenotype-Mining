<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was suddenly affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> during the clinical course of the disease and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002249'>melena</z:hpo> after 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anteroseptal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was made on the basis of the electrocardiography findings, and many perforated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were confirmed in specimens of the resected colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography showed constriction by 50% of the left anterior descending artery </plain></SENT>
