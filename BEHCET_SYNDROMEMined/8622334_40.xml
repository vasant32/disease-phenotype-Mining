<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e> of unknown pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is based on a set of international clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous investigations have suggested that immunological cross-reactivity between <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> within streptococcal heat-shock proteins and human <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> might be involved in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested four <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from mycobacterial heat-shock proteins to see if they specifically stimulated gamma delta T cells from BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then investigated this response to see whether it could be used as a laboratory test to diagnose BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a T-cell proliferative test to assay responses to four mycobacterial 65 kDa heat-shock-protein <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and to four homologous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the sequence of the human 60 kDa heat-shock protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We elicited significant gamma delta T-cell responses to the mycobacterial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in 25 (76%) of 33 patients with BD, compared with 2 (3.6%) of 55 controls with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>, or no disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of BD patients who had false-negative results decreased if the test was done during clinical manifestation of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between disease activity and T-cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four homologous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from human 60 kDa heat-shock protein also specifically stimulated T cells from patients with BD but with lower stimulation indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Activation of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells with the four heat-shock-protein <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> elicited significant T-cell proliferative responses by the gamma delta subset of T cells, which may regulate alpha <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36018">beta T</z:chebi> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> have a high specificity for BD, this assay can be used as a laboratory diagnostic test for BD </plain></SENT>
