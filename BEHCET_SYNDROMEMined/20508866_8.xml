<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-17 has been demonstrated to be involved in the development and maintenance of certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, including BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to investigate the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) on IL-17 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from BD patients in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were involved in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from these patients for analysis of IL-17 and interferon (IFN)-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients were re-evaluated at 1 and 3 months after treatment with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of IL-17 and IFN-gamma in the supernatants of PBMCs from patients before treatment cultured without or with CsA at different concentrations were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to evaluate the frequencies of IL-17-producing and IFN-gamma-producing T cells and the expression of CD69 on CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells before, 1, and 3 months after CsA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that significantly higher levels of IL-17 and IFN-gamma were observed in active BD patients as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with CsA could inhibit the production of both cytokines in association with an amelioration of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CsA significantly inhibited the production of IL-17 and IFN-gamma by PBMCs activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>,13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> and ionomycin in BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, CSA did not influence the CD69 expression in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi>,13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) ionomycin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that CsA can significantly inhibit the intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of BD patients and the expression of IL-17 and IFN-gamma in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the inhibitory effect of CsA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD patients may be partially mediated through inhibiting the production of IL-17 and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
