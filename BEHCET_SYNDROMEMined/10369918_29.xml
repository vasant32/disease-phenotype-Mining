<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently a new family of non-classical MHC molecules, the MHC class I chain-related protein (MIC), encoded by genes located in the major histocompatability complex have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the location of MIC genes and the structure and expression of MIC molecules it has been postulated that MIC may be a susceptibility factor in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of the 16 described external domain alleles and the transmembrane triplet repeats of MIC-A with BD in a Middle Eastern population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA from ninety-five patients and 102 age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction using allele specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results show an increase of MIC-A*009 in the BD patient group 44/95 (46%) compared with controls 24/102 (24%) (chi2=11.3, OR=2.8, P=0.00078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MIC-A*009 was also found to be strongly associated with HLA-B51 in the patients 39/44 (88%) when compared with controls 10/24 (42%) (chi2=4, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MIC-A*009 was also found in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B52, but only in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The A6 form of a MIC-A transmembrane triplet repeat was found to be significantly raised in the patients (80/95; 84%;) compared with controls (58/102, 57%) (chi2=17.5, OR=4, P=0.000028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the MIC-A associations described are highly significant, the association with HLA-B51 independently remains the most significant factor (chi2=56.8, P&lt;10(-6)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggests that as both MIC-A*009 and A6 are in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51, they are unlikely to be the susceptibility gene for BD but may be markers for additional risk factors </plain></SENT>
