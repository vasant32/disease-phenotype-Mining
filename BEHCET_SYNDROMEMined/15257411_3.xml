<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its pathogenesis is related to endothelial cell dysfunction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0522274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">humoral immune defects</z:e>, and immune system dysregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether disease activity, age, or duration of BD correlates with VEGF and bFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 33 patients and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor and bFGF serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We measured <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean serum VEGF level was significantly higher in patients with BD (398.8+/-222.2 pg/ml) than the control group (193.0+/-122.4 pg/ml) (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels were similar in both active and inactive BD (P=0.675) but did not correlate with disease duration, CRP, ESR, or age (P&gt;0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bFGF was below detection limits in 18 of 33 patients with BD and ten of 20 controls, and its mean serum level was higher in BD patients (42.4+/-76.9 pg/ml) than controls (29.0+/-9.1 pg/ml), but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.232) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The bFGF levels were similar in both active and inactive BD (P=0.09) and, in patients, correlated with disease duration and CRP (r=0.58, P=0.02; r=-0.57, P=0.02, respectively) but not with ESR or age (P&gt;0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor may be more important in the pathogenesis of BD than bFGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neither growth factor is an activity criterion or inflammatory marker in BD </plain></SENT>
