<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphic analysis of TAP genes was carried out in 46 Japanese patients with BD and 95 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in allele frequencies of TAP1 and TAP2 genes between whole patients with BD and control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in the frequencies of TAP alleles were observed, when patients of BD with complete type or incomplete type were compared with control population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An allele frequency of TAP2C was, however, slightly but significantly high in patients with BD who had symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (24.1%) as compared to the control group (11.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[p &lt; .05, RR = 2.4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of TAP2C was slightly high in HLA*B5101 positive patients with BD (28.6%) as compared to HLA*B5101 negative patients (10.9%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absence of genotype TAP2B/C was observed in whole patients group, though it was present in control subjects (14.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>[p = 0.003, RR = 0.06] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A genotype frequency of TAP2C/H was high in patients with BD who had symptom of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (7.5%) as compared to the control group (0.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>[p = 0.03, RR = 15.4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possibility that TAP molecule play some part in formation of skin lesion, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum in BD in Japanese </plain></SENT>
