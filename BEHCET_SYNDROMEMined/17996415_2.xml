<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients (52 ears) and 24 sex and age-matched healthy control subjects (48 ears) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pure-tone audiometry at frequencies 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000 Hz, immittance measures including tympanometry and acoustic reflex testing and DPOAE (distortion product otoacoustic emission) testing were performed in the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was found in eight patients (30.7%) as it was bilateral in five and unilateral in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no typical audiometric configuration was found, one patient had a flat type audiogram, and the others had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005101'>high frequency hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DPOAE responses of the patients and controls were significantly different in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frequencies (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that cochlea is affected by damage of outer hair cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
