<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total recanalization rate is low, so thrombotic segment could be detected by imaging afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For disclosing vein involvement, leg swelling is commonly queried in the history taking in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there are no data about the presence of "silent" <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed at investigating the integrity of venous vessels in BD, without any known vascular event by using Doppler ultrasonography (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients having past events revealed in the vascular questionnaire or physical findings attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> was detected in 74 patients in BD (74%), 24 out of 33 patients (72%) in AS and in 8 out of 34 (25%) in HC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were at the lower extremities, and there is no difference in the frequency between BD and AS, while both were significantly higher than in HC (P = 0.001, and 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
