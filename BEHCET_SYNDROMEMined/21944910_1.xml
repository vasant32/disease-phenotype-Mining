<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 25 patients (24 men/1 woman) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with nonpulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 23) or occlusions (n = 2) between 1996 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> were demonstrated with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) after first-line ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard surgical procedures were carried out in 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with a nonruptured saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> and 2 patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were managed only medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> located in the aortic bifurcation, we preferred aorto-bi-iliac bypasses; for the six extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, we were able to ligate the arteries; and for the other 10 extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> we used <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) grafts for bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> before the operation and were continued in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined between January and December 2010 paying special attention for new and anastomotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and graft patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and 1 patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 23 patients (92%) were under follow-up after a mean of 7.4 ± 2.9 years after their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> grafts (40%) inserted for extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> occluded with no disabling consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Also, 6 patients who were treated with ligation postoperatively began to complain of mild to moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> recurred at the anastomotic site, whereas in 3 patients, new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> developed at other sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The surgical management of large, nonpulmonary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease is currently quite satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When the false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is in the infrarenal aorta, aorto-bi-iliac bypass is the preferred surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be treated with synthetic graft insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, ligation can give satisfactory results; however, postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In some patients with small intact saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, surgery may not be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients must be prescribed immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> before and after the surgical intervention in order to avoid <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease activation </plain></SENT>
