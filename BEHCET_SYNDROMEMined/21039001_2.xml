<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a case control study, two groups of BD patients were included: 47 with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 49 without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the International Study Group Criteria for BD and the confirming diagnostic procedures for vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were either Doppler sonography or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine controls were selected by consecutive sampling among age and sex matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was measured by ELISA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the disease were compared between the two groups of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were done by ANOVA and Chi square tests; correlations were analyzed with Pearson test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was significantly higher in BD patients (14.9±13.9 μMol/L) than in healthy controls (9.9±6.7 μMol/L), P&lt;0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference was also significant when comparing the three groups by ANOVA: BD patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (24.2±13.2 μMol/L), BD patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (5.9±7.0 μMol/L), and healthy controls (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level and any organ involvement other than <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level was lower in HLA-B51 positive BD patients (11.6±12.1 vs. 21.7±16.3 μMol/L, P&lt;0.05), but the difference was not significant in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (20.9±13.2 vs. 29.5±12.7 μMol/L, P=0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> may be an independent risk factor for vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first study showing a negative correlation between HLA-B51 and plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
