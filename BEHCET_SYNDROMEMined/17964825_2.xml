<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between September 1998 and June 2006, the authors have performed 21 procedures for AAA in 12 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male to female sex ratio was 3:1 and mean age was 34 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was diagnosed clinically using criteria of International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease (1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were six infrarenal, five suprarenal, and one double (suprarenal and infrarenal)AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six graft interposition, six patch closure, and one stent-graft insertion were performed (one graft interposition and one patch closure were simultaneously performed for double AAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were noted in six (50%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four stent-graft insertion, two patch closures, one graft interposition and one explothoracotomy only were performed for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall recurrence rate of 21 procedures was 38.1%; 14.3% for graft interposition, 62.5% for patch closure, and 40% for stent-graft insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Though the resection and graft interposition is technically difficult in many occasions, it should be considered as the procedure of choice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endovascular interventions may be one of the treatment modality but the result needs further long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
