<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To characterize vascular symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) in patients treated for the last 10 years in the Institute of Rheumatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vascular symptoms of BD were studied in 151 patients with BD (mean age 33.5 +/- 9.5 years, duration of the disease 14.0 +/- 10.1 years, 104 males and 47 females, 67.4% carried HLA B51(5) antigen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex vascular scanning was made to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombotic complications were found in 37 of 151 (24.5%) patients with BD (30 males and 7 females, mean age 37.1 +/- 9.1 years, mean duration of the disease 7.3 +/- 9.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous thromboses prevailed (36 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four males (2.6%) had arterial lesions: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the iliac arteries (n = 1), <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the iliac artery (n = 1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the pulmonary arteries (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combination of venous and arterial manifestations occurred in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinus, occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels was diagnosed in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> was observed in 1/4 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to those observed worldwide and concerns <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and other thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the examinees, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> were associated with a young age, earlier development of thrombotic complications in males than in females </plain></SENT>
