<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at evaluating the long-term course of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and determining predictive factors of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This report is a retrospective study based on the records of 43 patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>��et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration was 73 +/- 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of medical treatment for the intestinal lesion at initial eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probabilities were calculated by using Kaplan-Meier method, and the results were compared by using the log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients (38 percent) achieved a complete remission of intestinal lesions eight weeks after medical treatment had begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients who achieved a complete remission had a lower probability of receiving an operation than those who had not (13 percent at 2 and 5 years vs. 36 and 43 percent, respectively; P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recurrence probability of intestinal lesions was 25 percent at two years and 49 percent at five years after complete remission with medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a history of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> had a higher probability of recurrence after operation than those without such history (59 vs. 33 percent at 2 years; 88 vs. 57 percent at 5 years; P = 0.020) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who had taken <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> had a lower probability of receiving reoperation than those who did not (7 vs. 25 percent at 2 years; 25 vs. 47 percent at 5 years; P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The length of ileal resection and whether hemicolectomy was performed had no significant effect on the recurrence or reoperation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease frequently requires a surgical treatment and has a high recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patients who achieved a complete remission with medical treatment, who had no history of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and who received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> after operation showed better clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Resection of a short segment of bowel would be a more appropriate surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
