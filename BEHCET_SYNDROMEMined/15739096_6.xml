<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to see whether ED was more prominent in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with vascular involvement (VI) than in those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 65 patients with BD, 27 of whom had VI, and 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High-resolution ultrasound was used to measure endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDVD) of brachial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, regardless of VI, EDVD was significantly impaired in patients with BD compared with controls (11.4 +/- 6.3 vs 20.4 +/- 9.1%,P = 0.001); however, EDVD was similar in BD patients with and without VI (9.7 +/- 6.3% vs 12.6 +/- 6.1%, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD had significantly-higher plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels than controls (13 +/- 6 micromol/L vs 9 +/- 3 micromol/L, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in the subgroup with VI than in those without (15 +/- 7 micromol/L vs 12 +/- 4 micromol/L, P = 0.03); however, we found no positive/significant correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and EDVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ED is a constant feature of BD, regardless of VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Etiology of ED in BD is probably multifactorial, including high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As both ED and elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels may represent an early atherosclerotic process, a more structured approach to risk factor assessment is needed in BD </plain></SENT>
