<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we comprehensively compared <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> autoantigens recognized by sera from BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> or healthy donors using proteomic technique, 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) followed by Western blotting (WB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six protein spots showing high reactivity with the serum from the BD patients were detected as candidate <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> autoantigens, and three of them were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of them were previously reported BD autoantigens, S-antigen and alpha-enolase, whereas the third one was <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> binding protein (SBP), a new candidate <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> autoantigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantigenicity of SBP was examined by WB and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a recombinant protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that 20 and 16% of the BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were positive for the anti-SBP antibody by WB and ELISA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of clinical parameters between anti-SBP antibody-positive and -negative patients revealed that the anti-SBP antibody-positive patient group showed more frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> than the antibody-negative patient group </plain></SENT>
