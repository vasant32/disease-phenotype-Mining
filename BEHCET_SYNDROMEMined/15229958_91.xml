<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the decrease in visual acuity due to ocular attack is seriously life-threatening, development of a new drug is anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-a (TNF-a) is involved in the symptoms of BD, particularly the activity of ocular symptoms, suppression of TNF-a might be effective in treating BD with uveoretinitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a clinical trial of infliximab, an anti-TNF-a chimeric monoclonal antibody, in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this open label trial, the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of repeated administration of infliximab were evaluated in 13 patients with BD accompanied by refractory uveoretinitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was administered 4 times at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and 10 at doses of either 5 or 10 mg/kg by intravenous drip infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency of ocular attacks was used as the primary index for evaluation of efficacy, with visual acuity and extraocular symptoms as secondary indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean numbers of ocular attacks, converted to frequency per 14 weeks, were 3.96 times for the 5 mg/kg group and 3.79 times for the 10 mg/kg group during the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with infliximab, they decreased to 0.98 times and 0.16 times, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A serious adverse event, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e>, was observed in one case in the 10 mg/kg group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum infliximab concentration increased with dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Administration of infliximab in patients with BD with refractory uveoretinitis suppressed the frequency of ocular attacks, and multiple administration was well tolerated, suggesting that infliximab is effective for this condition </plain></SENT>
