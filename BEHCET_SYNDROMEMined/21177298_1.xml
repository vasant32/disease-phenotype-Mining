<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional computed tomography demonstrated a saccular aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with a maximal diameter of 5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No bacteria were detected by serial blood cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, however, showed a multi-lobular cavity, mimicking an infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33282">antibacterial agents</z:chebi> for one week </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathological examination showed neither bacteria nor cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the resected aortic wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory changes with eosinophilic infiltration were recognized mainly around the adventitia near the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
