<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microbial agents have been proposed as causative agents in the disease flares </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fc gamma receptor 1 (CD64) is not normally expressed by neutrophils of healthy individuals, but is upregulated by these cells in response to microbial wall components and proinflammatory cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) CD64 expression is different in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated PMN CD64 expression in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with active BD (M/F: 18/19, mean age: 34.4 +/- 9.7 yrs), 35 patients with inactive BD (M/F: 11/24, mean age: 35.9 +/- 11.6 yrs), 27 patients with culture proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (M/F: 19/8, mean age: 54.4 +/- 15.2 yrs), 31 healthy controls (M/F: 14/17, mean age: 37.7 +/- 8.7 yrs), and 42 patients with active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (M/F: 13/29, mean age: 39.3 +/- 14.9 yrs) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to assess the prevalence of CD64-bearing PMN in whole blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of CD64-bearing PMN was significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> (77.1 +/- 18.4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> (37.1 +/- 27.5), and active BD (48.9 +/- 22.5) than in healthy controls (9.5 +/- 7.8) or patients with inactive BD (12.9 +/- 9.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD64 expression was similar in controls and patients with inactive BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> group, expression of CD64 was significantly higher than in the active BD and active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> groups, while there was no significant difference between the groups of patients with active BD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neutrophil CD64 expression increases during exacerbation of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increase appears to be a non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and does not reflect PMN activation triggered by a living microorganism </plain></SENT>
