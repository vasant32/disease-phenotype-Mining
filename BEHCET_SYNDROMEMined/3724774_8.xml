<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these observations were based on limited numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other have postulated the presence of a defect in DNA repair in cells from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our findings from a large survey of SCE frequencies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their diagnoses are <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, SLE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients had never received cytotoxic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Healthy individuals, hospital patients with diagnoses other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> and relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> have been used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results have been analysed by generalized linear modelling, and we have shown that patients with SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> and controls with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> have <z:mp ids='MP_0003701'>elevated SCE</z:mp> frequencies, both before and after adjustments have been made for the effect on SCEs of an individual's age, smoking habits, sex and race </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SCE frequencies increased with age by 4% per decade and the SCE frequencies of smokers were approximately 12% higher than those of nonsmokers of similar age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sex of an individual did not significantly affect SCEs but individuals from the Middle East were found to have lower counts than those originating from other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
