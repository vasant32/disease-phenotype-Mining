<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the dose-escalation study, ICR mice were treated intraperitoneally with dFdC over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the efficacy study, ICR mice were inoculated with HSV and classified as having ABD according to a revised Japanese classification, and then 18 ABD mice were randomly assigned to placebo, 0.06 or 0.12 microg of dFdC/day over 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After application of 3 microg of dFdC over 5 days, alanine aminotransferase increased (P = 0.032), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other kidney and liver parameters were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ABD mice, 5 days of dFdC treatment with 0.06 or 0.12 microg of dFdC/day resulted in a dose-dependent improvement of cutaneous manifestations by more than 60% (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in cytokine levels, and none of the cytokine levels correlated with response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, dFdC shows promising effects to improve cutaneous lesions in the HSV-induced ABD-like mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this animal model, effects of dFdC on the cytokine profile remained inconclusive </plain></SENT>
