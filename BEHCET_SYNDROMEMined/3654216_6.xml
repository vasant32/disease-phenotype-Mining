<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to their antiviral properties, these IFN types exert numerous other biological effects, which are increasingly exploited for therapeutic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 1982 to 1985 long-term recombinant alpha 1-interferon (rIFN-alpha A) was administered systemically in 39 patients with various severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we report our preliminary experiences with systemic administration of rIFN-alpha A in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> (MM, 9 patients), in disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100726'>Kaposi's sarcoma</z:hpo> (KS, 8 patients), and in severe <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In metastatic MM (clinical stage IV) the result was only moderate; the administration of IFN in earlier stages, for instance as a postoperative adjuvant therapy, appears more promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In disseminated KS with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) our experience was encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7/8 patients the general condition was stabilized and partial remission of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease both patients had good or excellent responses to IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The side effects of systemic rIFN-alpha A were moderate, dose-dependent, and tolerable </plain></SENT>
