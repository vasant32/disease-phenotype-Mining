<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow-mediated dilation in patients with BD was smaller than that of control subjects (p = 0.001), and mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in patients with BD were significantly higher (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On regression analysis, only mean plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentration was independently related to flow-mediated dilation (F = 5.7, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
