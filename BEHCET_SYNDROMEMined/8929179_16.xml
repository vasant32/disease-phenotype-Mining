<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Forty-six patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, who had been the subjects of a previous report with short-term follow-up, were reexamined 7 years later; 42 of them could be reexamined neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging, electromyography, and evoked potential studies were performed when available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 27 patients who had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> without any neurologic symptoms or signs previously, 2 had developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 7 patients in this group showed minor abnormalities on neurologic examination and/or other laboratory investigations, without history of any attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the previous neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group (n = 15), as defined by the presence of neurologic signs or symptoms, other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 7 had a stationary course, while 8 had been progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the latter group had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with progressive course had had abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings at the time of the previous report, whereas patients with a stationary course had not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Silent neurologic involvement may occur in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients should undergo periodic neurologic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The long-term prognosis in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome does not seem to be as favorable as we observed in short-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid findings may predict prognosis </plain></SENT>
