<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aims were to determine and compare the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> levels of patients with RA and BD and to investigate a possible association between disease activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 RA and 30 BD patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In RA patients; pain, morning stiffness duration, systemic involvement, tender-swollen joints, the physician-patient global assessments and DAS28 scores were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with BD, the BD Current Activity Form was assessed for disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beck <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory (BDI) was used for the evaluation of patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BDI score above 13 was considered as cut-off point for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pearson's correlation and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In RA patients, in spite of no correlation between disease activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, a significant correlation between BDI scores and pain was determined (p &lt; 0.000; r = 0.615) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BD group; positive correlations between BDI scores and patient's impression of disease activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo> were determined (p &lt; 0.014 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Number of BD patients with higher BDI scores than cut-off point was significantly more than those in RA group (p &lt; 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pain in RA patients, and patient's impression of disease activity and joint involvement in BD patients were found as related factors to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The greater ratio of BD patients with higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> score than those in RA indicates the need for increased awareness of depressive symptoms in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
