<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dark endothelial cells in the superficial and deep dermis exhibited degeneration with contraction changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, degenerated endothelial cells showed nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, vacuolization in the cytoplasm, and rich ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, blood vessels which were enveloped by cuffs of lymphocytes simultaneously exhibited both endothelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and endothelial cell <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The implied associations between perivascular lymphocytic cuffs and blood vessels exhibiting endothelial cell alterations indicate that microvascular changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions may be closely associated with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed-type hypersensitivity</z:mp> reaction </plain></SENT>
