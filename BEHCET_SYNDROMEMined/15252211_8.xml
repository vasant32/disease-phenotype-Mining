<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment comprises immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We successfully treated 50 patients with ocular BD with interferon-alpha2a (IFN-alpha2a) (response rate 92%), although this is counterintuitive because IFN-alpha is immunostimulatory and can sometimes even induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the immunomodulatory effects that IFN-alpha might exert on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in BD by examining changes in the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations under IFN-alpha2a treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with ocular BD were evaluated before and at weeks 4 and 24 of IFN-alpha treatment and compared with 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PBMC were stained with monoclonal antibodies and measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the controls there is a significant elevation of monocytes (CD14(+)), CD8(+)/gammadelta T cells, CD3(+)/gammadelta T cells, natural killer (NK) cells (CD56(+)/CD16(+)) and activated/regulatory T cells (CD4(+)/CD25(+) and CD8(+)/CD25(+)) in patients with active BD before treatment with IFN-alpha2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numbers of naïve T cells (CD8(+)/CD45(+)RA(+)/RO(-), CD4(+)/CD45(+)RA(+)/RO(-)) were significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under therapy, NK cells, CD8(+)/gammadelta T cells and CD3(+)/gammadelta T cells decreased significantly, whereas B cells increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The previously reduced expression of HLA class I on monocytes in HLA-B51-positive patients rose to levels comparable to HLA-B51-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results implicate the participation of NK cells and gammadelta T cells, especially CD8(+)/gammadelta T cells, in the pathogenesis of BD and may explain one mechanism by which IFN-alpha2a exerts therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, they may result indirectly from remission induction by IFN-alpha2a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The reduced expression of HLA class I on monocytes in HLA-B*51-positive patients might reflect an impaired expression of and antigen presentation by HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
