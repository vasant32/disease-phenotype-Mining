<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is an uncommon allele absent from the healthy control group, which seems to confer higher relative risk than B51 in this study (OR 1.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stratified frequencies do not show statistically significant differences but suggest that the Cw*1602-B51 haplotype could be the main HLA marker of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in the analyzed population </plain></SENT>
