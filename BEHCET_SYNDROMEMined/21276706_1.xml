<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is an autoimmune, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> disease that is characterized by oral aphthous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> and ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular manifestations in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are the main predictors of mortality and morbidity in such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normally, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are located in the pulmonary arteries, the aorta, carotid, subclavia, and the femoropopliteal sector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Open surgery presents a maximum complication rate of 50%, principally in the form of anastomotic pseudoaneurysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the case of a 41-year-old man who was diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease 3 years before, and attended the emergency department after a 10-day history of pain and an infragenicular swelling <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the right limb, without any previous record of trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An initial vascular exploration revealed a pusatile mass in the infrapopliteal region and absence of the posterior tibial pulse in the right limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rest of the exploration did not reveal any alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Doppler ultrasound scan showed a ruptured infrapopliteal pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An emergency, selective arteriography of the popliteal artery was performed by using a contralateral femoral access approach, and a ruptured tibioperoneal pseudoaneurysm was embolized with three 5-mm metallic coils (Cook) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged after 4 days and in the 2 years since then has remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the distal vessels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are very infrequent and each case should be evaluated on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment is a good therapeutic alternative </plain></SENT>
