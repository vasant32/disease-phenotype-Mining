<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in a Druze community in Israel, we conducted a two-stage clinic-based survey in an Israeli Druze town </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first stage aimed to identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who visited three of the largest clinics in the town during a period of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second stage aimed to identify those patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for BD according to the International Study Group (ISG) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One thousand and eighty-three out of about 4,000 registered subjects were interviewed, 63 of whom had <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients fulfilled the ISG criteria for BD, resulting in a calculated prevalence in the range of 2:1,083-2:4,000, i.e., 50-185:100,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another two patients with oral and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> but without eye or <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were diagnosed as suspected BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The very high prevalence of BD, as found in our study, places the Druze among the populations with the highest prevalence of the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world, though selection biases could account for overestimation as well as underestimation of the actual BD prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings call for genetic studies to explore whether there is a genetic predisposition to BD in this population </plain></SENT>
