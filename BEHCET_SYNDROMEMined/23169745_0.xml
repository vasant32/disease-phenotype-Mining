<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence of subclinical entheseal involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease via ultrasound using a newly developed method, the Madrid sonography <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted with 36 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and 46 healthy sex- and age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who had no clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> underwent an ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sonographic findings were identified according to the Madrid sonography <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Madrid sonography <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> index values of patients and control subjects were compared by Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Validity was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> score was 12.16 ± 6.16 among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and 2.06 ± 2.18 among healthy control subjects (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic curve established an ultrasound score greater than 4.5 in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease group as the best cut-off point differentiating case subjects from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This cutoff was exceeded by 88.8% of the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the Madrid sonography <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> index score in each affected enthesis was evaluated, patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease had significantly higher scores than did control subjects when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> entheseal sites were compared (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p values &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study to our knowledge to show significant subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enthesopathy</z:e> of the triceps tendon enthesis in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease who had no arthritic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the Madrid sonography <z:hpo ids='HP_0100686'>enthesitis</z:hpo> index scoring system for sonographic detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enthesopathy</z:e> should be incorporated into the clinical protocol for evaluating patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease in routine clinical practice </plain></SENT>
