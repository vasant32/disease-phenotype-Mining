<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generally, NBD patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> course are refractory to immunosuppressive treatment, resulting in the deterioration of personality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, levels of B cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF) were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 18 patients with NBD, 27 patients with epidemic aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (AM), 24 patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and 34 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BAFF levels in patients with NBD were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls, but showed no statistically significant elevation compared with either of the disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CSF IL-6 levels were slightly elevated in patients with NBD and significantly elevated in patients with AM and MS compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with NBD were subdivided into two groups according to their clinical course (eight patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> course presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and 10 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> course including aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, brainstem involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAFF levels were significantly increased in those with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> course compared with those with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSF BAFF levels did not correlate with serum BAFF levels, CSF cell counts or CSF IL-6 levels in patients with NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that BAFF was produced within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and may be associated with the development of NBD, particularly with a progressive course </plain></SENT>
