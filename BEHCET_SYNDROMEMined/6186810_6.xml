<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most striking changes were found in the synovial B cells, many containing abnormally large mitochondria with altered cristae surrounded by fibrillar material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar material was present in dilated endoplasmic reticulum which was the probable source of groups of extracellular fibrillar spheroidal bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The B cells also contained electron dense granular lysosomes of very variable size which, in common with the abnormal mitochondria, were often associated with bundles of orientated microfilaments and large golgi complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy of the synovial membrane was consistent with an inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, as were the high white cell counts in the synovial fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systemic activity in the patients was indicated by raised ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
