<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the application of stent-grafts in the management of aortic and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in seven patients were managed with various types of stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were based on clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 3) were thoracic (n = 1), suprarenal (n = 1), or infrarenal (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 6) were in the right and left subclavian (n = 2), right common carotid (n = 2), right brachiocephalic (n = 1), or left common iliac arteries (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tandem connection of Gianturco stent covered with polytetrafluorethylene was placed in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and a balloon-expandable stent was placed in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stent-graft was successfully placed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immediate follow-up angiography revealed complete exclusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up computed tomography performed 3 days to 2 weeks later revealed complete exclusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and patency of the stent-graft in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient, total occlusion of the artery with a stent occurred due to flow disturbance caused by double lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (range, 6-59 months; mean, 28 months), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resolved and completely regressed in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the distal margin of previously inserted stent-graft was successfully managed with an additional stent-graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings in this initial experience suggest that stent-graft insertion may be a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment of aortic and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
