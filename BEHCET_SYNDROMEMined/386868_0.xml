<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Biological tests revealed the presence of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> in 5 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Needle biopsy showed extra-membranous or mesangial fibrinoid deposits in 6 cases, associated in 1 case with segmental and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017657" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glomerulitis</z:e> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated glomerular deposits of mesangial and extra-membranous C3, sometimes with immunoglobulins (IgA-AgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural examination was carried out in 7 cases and showed "hump" deposits attached to the external face of the basal membrane and rounded nodules of 7 to 15 mu included in the mesangium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of immune complexes in the renal glomeruli, therefore, is not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unusual in this disease, which is probably auto-immune in nature, and in fact appears to be a quite frequent occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These deposits, which were probably well-tolerated by most of the patients in this series, might be involved in the production of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100820'>glomerulopathies</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cases, as observed in one of the cases studied </plain></SENT>
