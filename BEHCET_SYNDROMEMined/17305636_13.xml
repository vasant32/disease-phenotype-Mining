<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-six BD patients, 28 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and 117 healthy controls (HC) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, the frequency and healing time of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multidimensional properties of OHIP-14 were examined by factor analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed three subscales and explained 66.49% of overall variance in these patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The score of Subscale 1 was positively correlated with the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> per month (P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subscale 3 scores of the patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were worse than those treated with immunosuppressives (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The factor structure of OHIP-14 was found to be reliable and sensitive to clinical parameters and treatment modalities in active patients </plain></SENT>
