<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (31 patients with and 33 patients without ocular involvement) and 23 healthy control subjects were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous blood was collected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum uPAR levels were determined by using human uPAR immunoassay (Quantikine) kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in serum uPAR levels between the patients and the control subjects (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant correlations between uPAR levels and age, gender, duration of the disease, clinical manifestations (genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, ocular and vascular involvements) and activity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This finding is important since this is the first study regarding uPAR levels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
