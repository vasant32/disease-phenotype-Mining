<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients with BD and 21 control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were queried for the clinical manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum vitronectin concentrations were determined by using in vitro enzyme immunoassay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum vitronectin levels between the patients and the control subjects were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference between vitronectin levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients with and without ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between vitronectin concentrations and clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating vitronectin levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies involving larger numbers of subjects would be useful to improve our understanding of the functions of vitronectin in BD </plain></SENT>
