<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the existence of autoantibodies to killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), especially p58.1 (KIR2DL1) and p58.2 (KIR2DL3), in patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera from 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), 22 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and 20 healthy control subjects were tested for anti-p58.1 and anti-p58.2 antibodies by Western blot analysis using recombinant p58.1 and p58.2 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the anti-p58.1/58.2 antibody-positive and -negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-p58.1 antibodies were detected in 7 (23.3%) of the 30 patients with SLE, 9 (30%) of the 30 patients with RA, and 6 (27.3%) of the 22 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-p58.2 antibodies were detected in the same 22 patients who were positive for the anti-p58.1 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the serum samples from the healthy donors were positive for antibodies to the recombinant p58.1 or p58.2 molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the anti-p58.1/ 58.2 antibody-negative patients, the anti-p58.1/58.2 antibody-positive patients had significantly elevated levels of serum IgG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 diseases tested, an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in RA and SLE, and decreased white blood cell counts in RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report is the first to describe the presence of autoantibodies to KIR2DL (p58.1 and p58.2) in the sera of patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considering the correlation with several clinical features, these autoantibodies may be involved in the pathologic process of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
