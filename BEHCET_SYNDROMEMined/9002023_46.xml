<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the levels of the T cell regulatory cytokines interleukin 10 (IL-10) and IL-12 in plasma of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), and to assess the value of cytokines and cytokine <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> as biological markers of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sera/plasma of 66 consecutive outpatients with established diagnosis of BD were analyzed for the presence of IL-2R, IL-6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble (s) TNF receptor (R)-55, sTNFR-75, IL-10, and IL-12 using immunological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional laboratory measurements included erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the history and clinical examination were recorded to correlate cytokine levels with clinical markers of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 18 patients had inactive (Group I), 36 had mildly active (Group II), and 12 patients had active BD (Group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-10 was elevated in 42 plasma samples (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of samples containing IL-10 and the median levels of IL-10 of the 3 patient groups did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-12 was detectable in plasma of 9 patients: One from Group I (5%), 3 from Group II (8%), and 5 from Group III (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL-12 correlated with disease activity (difference between Groups I and III, p = 0.02, between Groups II and III, p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ESR in patients with active disease and mildly active disease was significantly higher than values in patients with inactive disease (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, respectively), while median CRP levels were significantly different between Group I and Group III only (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>sTNFR-75 levels were significantly different between Groups II and III (p = 0.003) and between Groups I and III (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The elevation of plasma IL-10 in the majority of patients and the correlation of IL-12 plasma levels with disease activity suggest a pathogenic role of a TH1-type immune response in active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, the correlation of sTNFR-75 levels with disease activity indicates that sTNFR-75 may serve as a biological marker of disease activity in BD </plain></SENT>
