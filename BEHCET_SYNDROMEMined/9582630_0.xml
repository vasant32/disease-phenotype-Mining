<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the treatment of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>Gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> (GH) is one of the important side effects that have been observed in some of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the CyA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 3 study groups, each having 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first group displaying GH, mast cells were located between epithelial cells and in the connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mast cell granules were in crystalline form and electron-dense cored form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts and plasma cells were present in the connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second group did not display GH and the mast cells were similar to those in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The third group, was the control group, in which the mast cells were located between the epithelial cells and connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mast cell granules were in electron-dense cored form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the development of CyA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> is determined mainly by individual sensitivity to CyA, because although both test groups which received CyA showed an increased number and activity of fibroblasts, only one group of patients developed GH </plain></SENT>
