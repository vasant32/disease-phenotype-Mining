<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the relative frequency of sensitized lymphocytes by these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, 7353 short term cell lines were generated from the lymphocytes of patients and controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 is significantly associated with BD, but there was no evidence that B51 was a restricting element, when B51+ patients were compared with B51- patients with BD, and with B51+ healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
