<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment mainly comprises systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement, mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in 20-50% of the involved eyes within 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of interferon alfa-2a was studied in patients with sight threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 50 patients were included in this open, non-randomised, uncontrolled prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human interferon alfa-2a (rhIFNalpha-2a) was applied at a dose of 6 million units subcutaneously daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dose reduction was performed according to a decision tree until discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was evaluated every 2 weeks by the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease activity scoring system and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rate of the ocular manifestations was 92% (three non-responder, one incomplete response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean visual acuity rose significantly from 0.56 to 0.84 at week 24 (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>Posterior uveitis</z:hpo> score of the affected eyes fell by 46% every week (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Remission of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was achieved by week 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease activity score fell from 5.8 to 3.3 at week 24 and further to 2.8 at week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After a mean observation period of 36.4 months (range 12-72), 20 patients (40%) are off treatment and disease free for 7-58 months (mean 29.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the other patients maintenance IFN dosage is three million units three times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rhIFNalpha-2a is effective in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, leading to significant improvement of vision and complete remission of ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
