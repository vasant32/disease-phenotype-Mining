<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), there is a marked increase in vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of patients with BD suffer from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the arteries and veins, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of superficial or deep veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein C and Protein S are major inhibitors of coagulation, and it is well known that the deficiency of Protein C and Protein S causes thrombotic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Protein C and Protein S activities were measured in 23 patients with BD and in a control group consisting of 23 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who had received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or oral contraceptive drugs, or who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> or active <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, were not included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 23 patients with BD (age, 13-55 years), the mean Protein S activities (94.2 +/- 11.3%) were slightly lower than the means of the control group (109.1 +/- 8.4%), but not statistically significant differences could be demonstrated (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with the means of the control group (103.5 +/- 6.9%), the Protein C activities were not lower in BD (106.3 +/- 8.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Protein S deficiencies</z:e> are not a probable cause of thrombotic manifestations in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We do not recommend the measurement of these activities routinely in BD unless <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is the major and primary manifestation of BD </plain></SENT>
