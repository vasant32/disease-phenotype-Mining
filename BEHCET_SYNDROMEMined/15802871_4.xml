<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether BD patients without neurological involvement have any changes in cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty BD patients without neurological involvement and 13 control subjects were included in the study and were analyzed by neurophysiological and neuropsychological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cognitive event-related potentials (P300) were recorded from the frontal, central and parietal areas of the right and left hemispheres of the patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
