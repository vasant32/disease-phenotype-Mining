<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report here the main characteristics, treatment and outcome of 23 patients (5 personal cases and 18 patients from the literature) with a pseudotumoural presentation of NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pseudotumoural NBD patients were compared with 69 consecutive patients, with a classical form of NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 39 (range 27-48 years) years, with a male predominance (65.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of the pseudotumoural NBD included hemi- or tetra-pyramidal symptoms (n = 20), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 17), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar syndrome</z:e> (n = 3), sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000802'>impotence</z:hpo> (n = 3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002200'>pseudobulbar signs</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> imaging showed pseudotumoural lesions mainly in the capsulo-thalamic area (69.6 vs 11.6% for classical NBD; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis revealed necrotic lesions with perivascular inflammatory infiltrate without signs of tumoural or infectious lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with pseudotumoural NBD had more severe initial disability status (Rankin's score ≥3 in 65.2 vs 24.7%; P &lt; 0.01) and had a 3 years' longer duration between neurological signs and BD diagnosis (P = 0.01) compared with patients with classical NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of CSs (n = 21, 95.5%) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> (n = 10, 35.7%) that led to complete clinical and imaging remission in 60.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two (8.7%) of the 23 patients with pseudotumoural NBD died of bedridden state complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pseudotumoural form of NBD is a rare and life-threatening condition </plain></SENT>
