<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Standard treatment mainly comprises systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a study primarily designed for refractory ocular disease, we additionally evaluated the efficacy of recombinant human interferon-alpha2a (rhIFN-alpha2a) on the extraocular manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RhIFN-alpha2a was applied at a dose of 6 x 10(6) units subcutaneously daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose reduction was performed according to a decision tree until discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was evaluated by the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Activity Scoring System and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> Scoring System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rate of the ocular manifestations was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity rose significantly from 0.56 to 0.84 at week 24 (P &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Activity Score fell in a dose-dependent fashion by 1.2 points in the first week (P &lt;.0001) and from 5.8 to 3.3 at week 24 and further to 2.8 at week 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a mean observation period of 36.4 months, 17 patients have been off treatment and disease-free for 29.5 months (mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the other patients, maintenance IFN dosage is 3 million units 3 times weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Whereas extraocular manifestations such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> remitted with IFN, only 36% of oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RhIFN-alpha2a is effective in ocular BD, resulting in significant improvement of vision and complete remission of ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is also beneficial for the extraocular manifestations of the disease, although less so for oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
