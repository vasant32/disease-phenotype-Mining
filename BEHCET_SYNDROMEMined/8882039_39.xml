<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to describe the roles of various cytokines in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were studied in 24 patients with active BD and 15 healthy adults as controls, by ELISA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were separated into 2 groups according to the number of active organ systems (Group I: &lt; 3 vs Group II: &gt; or = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: sIL-2R and age adjusted TNF-alpha levels were higher in patients with BD compared to controls (p = 0.004 and p = 0.002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But the median concentrations of Group I and Group II were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-2 and IL-6 were similar to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High serum levels of sIL-2R and TNF-alpha indicate activation of the immune system in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But this finding may not be useful as a marker of disease activity </plain></SENT>
