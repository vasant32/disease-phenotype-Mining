<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in blood rheology, specially increased erythrocyte aggregation has been suggested to play an important role in the development of thrombotic events in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to ascertain whether any rheological parameter could be involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease we have determined plasmatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, hematocrit, erythrocyte aggregation (Myrenne aggregometer), erythrocyte deformability (Rheodyn SSD), blood viscosity (Brookfield viscosimeter), plasma viscosity (Fresenius capillary viscosimeter) and erythrocyte indexes in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with a non-active disease when sampling, and a well matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient group was made up of 40 Behçet's patients (20 male, 20 female aged 43+/-12 years) and the control group comprised 70 healthy volunteers (24 male, 46 female aged 45+/-13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 40 Behçet's patients have had a previous documented history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> at least six months before entering the study, and the other 28 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When patients and controls were compared, patients showed a statistically higher fibrinogen level (p=0.002), plasma viscosity (p=0.003), blood viscosity (p=0.021) and erythrocyte aggregation (p=0.049), the other rheological parameters not being statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the rheological parameters when patients with and without a previous thrombotic episode were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that rheological alterations do not seem to play any role in the development of thrombotic events in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
