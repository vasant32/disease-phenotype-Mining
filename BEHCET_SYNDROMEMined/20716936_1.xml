<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the production of B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), an important regulator of B-cell survival and immunoglobulin class-switch recombination, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from BD patients having pulmonary manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 15 BD patients with pulmonary manifestation and 18 BAL from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of B cell-active cytokines, including BAFF, IL-6, and IL-13, were measured by using specific ELISA and cytometric bead array assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of BAFF protein were significantly increased in BAL fluid from active BD [109 +/- 21.78 pg/mL] compared with those oh healthy controls [4.83 +/- 1.75 pg/mL; P&lt;0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the BAL fluid, BAFF levels were significantly correlated with absolute numbers of total cells [r = 0.823; P&lt;0.0001], lymphocytes [r = 0.709; P&lt;0.0001], neutrophils [r = 0.809; P&lt;0.0001] and macrophages [r = 0.742; P&lt;0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normalization to albumin indicated that BAFF production occurred locally in the airways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAFF levels were also significantly correlated with the other B cell-activating cytokines IL-6 [r = 0.882, P&lt;0.001] and IL-13 [r = 0.659, P&lt;0.001].The antigen-induced production of BAFF in the lung of active BD with pulmonary manifestations might contribute to immunoglobulin synthesis by B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cells residing in the lung might affect each other through BAFF </plain></SENT>
