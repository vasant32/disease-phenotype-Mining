<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The -1562C&gt;T and -91 [CA](n) repeat polymorphisms can affect MMP-9 promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the distributions of these functional polymorphisms in 122 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and in 122 gender- and age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of MMP-9 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of "L" alleles with [CA](n) &lt;21 was significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD patients (vs controls, odds ratio (OR) = 0.371 [95% confidence interval 0.152-0.905]) and male patients (vs male controls, OR = 0.117 [0.019-0.737]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frequency of "H/H" homozygote with [CA](n) &gt; or = 21 was significantly higher in BD patients than controls (OR = 2.677 [1.065-6.729]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequency of CL haplotype with lower promoter activity was significantly lower in BD patients (vs controls, OR = 0.374 [0.149-0.939]) and in BD patients with visceral involvement (OR = 0.202 [0.044-0.916]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although plasma MMP-9 levels were not different between controls and BD patients, concentrations of this substance were significantly higher in male patients (vs male controls, p = 0.044) or patients with visceral involvements (vs patients without visceral involvement, p = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MMP-9 is a novel susceptibility gene and its promoter polymorphisms can affect the development of visceral involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
