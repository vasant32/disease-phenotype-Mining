<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease has been historically classified as a Th1 disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recently described IL-17/IL-23 pathway seems to play an important role in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> and in the intestinal abnormalities of AS and CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the IL-17/IL-23 axis in parallel with Th1 and IL-27 response in the intestine of patients with BD and gastrointestinal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Quantitative TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was utilised for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> determinations on ileal biopsy specimens obtained from BD, AS and CD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A Th1 but not a Th17 response is present in the gastrointestinal involvement of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although BD shares clinical manifestations with both CD and AS, the immunologic abnormalities seen in the intestine are quite different, indicating that other immune mechanisms should be taken into account </plain></SENT>
