<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequency of these variants in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA samples of 200 BD patients [59 Caucasians, 139 Middle Easterns (MEs) of Arab descent and 2 Asians] and 520 healthy controls (444 Caucasians and 76 MEs) were genotyped using a Taqman assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the Arg702Trp and Leu1007fs (frameshift) variants were significantly less frequently present among BD patients compared with healthy controls (0.5 vs 5.8%; P &lt; 1.10(-5) and 0.0 vs 1.8%; P &lt; 0.007, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the Caucasian subpopulation, Arg702Trp was significantly less frequent in the BD group as compared with the controls (P = 0.04); whereas in the ME subpopulation, a trend was observed (P &lt; 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of the three CD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, one of the variant NOD2 alleles, was found to be present significantly less in Caucasian BD patients </plain></SENT>
