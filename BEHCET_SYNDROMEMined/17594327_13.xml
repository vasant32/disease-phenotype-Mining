<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Files of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and spinal cord involvement were reviewed retrospectively, in comparison with other types of p-NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amongst 216 patients with p-NBD, 24 had spinal cord involvement (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most commonly patients presented with sensory-motor symptoms, sphincter and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033953" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual dysfunction</z:e> evolving over days </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that spinal cord involvement has even worse prognosis compared with other types of p-NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, recognition of spinal cord involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients should prompt early vigorous treatment </plain></SENT>
