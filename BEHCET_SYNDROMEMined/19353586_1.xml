<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is an established literature, which describes features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome occurring in phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 in their bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe four patients with constitutional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with varying clinical phenotypes, who developed features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet, in particular but not exclusively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521478" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">mucocutaneous ulceration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we examined gene copy numbers of the variable-number neutrophil defensin genes DEFA1A3 in one of the cases (case 1) and her parents, together with 14 cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome in comparison with 121 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene copy number was highest in case 1 (copy number 14) and was also increased in her parents (both copy number 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However the mean copy number for DEFA1A3 among the 14 Behçet syndrome patients was actually lower (5.1) than among the controls (mean of 6.8 copies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that patients with constitutional <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and those with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 confined to the bone marrow are both at increased risk of developing features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may relate to increased chromosome 8 gene dosage with further analysis of candidate genes on chromosome 8 required </plain></SENT>
