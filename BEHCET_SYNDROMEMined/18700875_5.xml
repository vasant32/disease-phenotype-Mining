<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Etiology and pathogenesis of BD are not fully elucidated, but the association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 or B*5101 has been repeatedly reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that there are few sequence variations in the protein-coding region of B51, while there is a report on many variations in the 5'-flanking region and intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, HLA-B*5101 gene from 37 individuals including Japanese, Turkish, Jordanian and Iranian patients and healthy controls were fully sequenced to further clarify the B*5101 gene in association with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and healthy controls carried B*510101 with no variation in the 5'-flanking region, exon and intron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, seven polymorphisms were found in the 3'-flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms composed of six haplotypes that were shared and stretched over the ethnic groups, suggesting that the susceptibility to BD was conferred by the B*510101 itself and not by any genes in linkage disequilibrium with B*510101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, phylogenetic analyses of B*510101 showed that the 3'-flanking sequences followed an evolutional divergence differently from that of the other regions, implying that a unifying selection might operate to conserve B*510101 </plain></SENT>
