<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) and sex distribution, mode of disease appearance, and number of organs involved during the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BD was defined according to the International Study Group criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from medical files and from patient interviews were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed for children and adults, according to age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A systemic involvement index was calculated as the sum of visceral organ systems involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients with BD were studied, 26 male and 33 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 8.4 +/- 4.5 years in children and 29.8 +/- 7.9 years in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was significantly lower in male versus female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BD presented in children almost entirely as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo>, while in adults, less than one-third of patients presented first with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of patients who presented first with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> was significantly lower than the age of patients presenting first with non-oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean systemic involvement index was higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile onset</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A significant linear correlation was found between age of disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and total number of visceral organ systems involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BD was observed to occur earlier in males than in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The first manifestation of BD in children is almost exclusively in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, while older patients have a large proportion of non-oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> as their first disease manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at an older age is positively correlated with increased disease spectrum </plain></SENT>
