<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Results that were obtained from three patients and a literature review allow the authors to better define the place of medical and surgical treatments according to the different locations of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurring in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective report of five cases of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that occurred during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Due to the unusual symptoms, diagnosis can be hampered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though lesions may be observed in various areas, they were mostly aortic (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It mainly involved prosthetic grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were subsequently treated by postoperative immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was observed in one patient, while in another patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed in a new location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These types of arterial lesions respond poorly to medical treatment when a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and intermittent intravenous bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications should be given great yet selected weight, using prosthetic rather than venous autologous grafts (due to the risk of spontaneous venous involvement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since either complication or recurrence is possible, prolonged monitoring is required </plain></SENT>
