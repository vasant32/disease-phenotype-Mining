<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of granulocyte apheresis (GCAP) in patients with Ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease (BD) resistant to immunosuppressive therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, cyclosporin, azathyoprine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prospective observational study of five cases, carried out in a university centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients were resistant to medical treatment and one refused immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intervention procedure consisted of an extracorporeal GCAP using a column filled with cellulose <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> beads (Adacolumn, JIMRO, Takasaki, Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received underwent a schedule of therapy of five sessions, once a week for five consecutive weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity (Snellen lines), the degree of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and doses of immunosuppressive therapy were measured and observed every week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual acuity improved in the five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was measured and observed in every case, relapses were avoided, and treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was reduced by more than half of the initial dose (average reduction 52.7%, SD 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GCAP has been shown to be safe and effective as a new therapy in five cases of Ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease refractory to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed in order to confirm the promising results of these initial investigations </plain></SENT>
