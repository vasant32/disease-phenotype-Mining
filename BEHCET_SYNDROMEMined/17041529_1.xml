<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: 33 patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (mean age: 27 years) imaged by MRI were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most common neurologic symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and pyramidal signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI examinations (Siemens Magnetom Impact 1 Tesla) included the following sequences: T1wi, T2wi, Flair, MPR-3D and MRA sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Parenchymal lesions were identified in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brainstem, internal capsule, cerebral white matter, basal ganglia were involved respectively in 14, 10, 7, and 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (venous: n=7; arterial: n=1) were observed in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows the value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for the exploration of parenchymal lesions of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's and confirms the frequency of brainstem involvement </plain></SENT>
