<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used brain single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET) to detect hypoperfused areas in 15 consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five were suspected of having neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, having at least one neurological symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For these patients, SPET was performed within 1 month of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 15 patients fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological assessment and SPET were complemented by EEG in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients with suspected neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome and by magnetic resonance imaging in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain SPET detected hypoperfused regions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five neurological patients; EEG showed abnormalities in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the three patients in whom it was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPET was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without neurological involvement and 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SPET detected a reduction in brain blood flow in early neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, but there was no definitive correlation between the hypoperfused brain regions and the clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to evaluate the significance of brain hypoperfusion and the value of SPET in the early diagnosis of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
