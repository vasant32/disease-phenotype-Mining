<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ocular features (76%) were bilateral in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and were dominated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> complicated by macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> ant <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
