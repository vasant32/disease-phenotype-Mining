<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Using medical records from the rheumatology unit, Siriraj hospital, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> by our rheumatology staff were identified and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical presentations, and laboratory data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were also reviewed if they had fulfilled any of the following criteria: Iran classification tree, Japanese, Korean, ISG and O'Duffy's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of each criterion was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty three cases were identified during a 24 year interval (1980-2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our population had a mean age of 30.83 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common clinical presentations were recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> 100% (23/23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> 69.6% (16/23), eye involvement 52.2% (12/23), skin involvement 60.9% (14/23), GI <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> 8.7% (2/23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> 4.3% (1/23), vascular lesions 8.7% (2/23), <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement 8.7% (2/23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> 60.9% (14/23), and positivity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test 33.3% (3/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of criteria used for diagnosis of our patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> varied widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found that the Iran classification tree criteria had the highest sensitivity followed by those from Japan (82.6%), O'Duffy's (73.9%), ISG (52.2%), and Korean (39.1%o) criteria respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in its manifestations and clinical constellation of the disease varies widely among different parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first epidemiologic study describing Thai <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also found the Iran classification tree criteria had the highest sensitivity for diagnosis of Thai patients </plain></SENT>
