<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had been treated previously with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, and immunosuppressives, without satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were given an initial oral dose of 5 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> medication was tapered and eventually completely stopped after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number and severity of ocular attacks (anterior and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> with vitreous haze) were significantly reduced below pretreatment levels during therapy (Kolmogorov Smirnov two-pair test: P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved in 32% and remained unchanged in 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No ocular attacks recurred in 11 eyes; they recurred 1 time in 8 eyes; 2 times in 3 eyes; and 3 times in 3 eyes during CA therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two cases with vaso-obstructive changes, treatment with CA was not effective and laser photocoagulation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on our study, we recommend that an initial dose of 5 mg/kg/day CA be used in the systemic medical treatment of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CA can be continued at this low dosage for an unspecified time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> does not totally resolve at this dosage or the inflammatory process recurs, combining the CA with low doses of a steroid should be considered </plain></SENT>
