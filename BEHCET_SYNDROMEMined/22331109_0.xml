<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate demographic findings, ocular manifestations, vascular and morphological changes by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography and optical coherence tomography of retina and choroid in cases of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records were reviewed to obtain data from 16 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who were in inactive phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent ophthalmic examination, simultaneous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography and optical coherence tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were also divided into two groups according to disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen females and three males were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main findings of ocular exams were narrowing of vessels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the optic disc and macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100014'>epiretinal membrane</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>62.5% had visual acuity equal to or better than 0.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main findings of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography were capillary leak and impregnation of the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most important findings of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography were hypofluorescent well defined lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main findings of optical coherence tomography were macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100014'>epiretinal membrane</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001105'>retinal atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the visual acuity, no statistical correlation was found between gender, disease duration or presence of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography or optical coherence tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increase in macular thickness was not correlated positively with patient age, disease duration or with the visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vascular narrowing seen on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography was correlated with longer duration of illness (p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The remaining test findings were not correlated with disease duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography and optical coherence tomography are valuable tools to assess the posterior pole in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite the apparent clinical control, these tests may show persistent inflammatory activity, which causes progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> and a significant number of patients with legal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
