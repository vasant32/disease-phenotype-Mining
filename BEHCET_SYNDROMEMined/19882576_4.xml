<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a prospective, institutional clinical trial including 43 patients with ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two subgroups: those with active posterior segment involvement (Group A) and those with inactive ocular BD (Group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group A included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e> or chorioretinal involvement), while Group B included patients with no active intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> within the last 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and spectrophotometric assay and compared among the groups by independent sample t test and Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum levels of the mediators in Group A (IL-6 [23.1 pg/mL], IL-8 [161.1 pg/mL], TNF-alpha [30.5 pg/mL], VEGF [455.9 pg/mL], <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> [10.7 microm]) were found to be significantly higher than those in Group B (IL-6 [12.2 pg/mL], IL-8 [48.4 pg/mL], TNF-alpha [18.6 pg/mL], VEGF [138.0 pg/mL], <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> [5.1 microm]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that increased serum levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, VEGF, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> were possibly involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
