<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of this complication, however, has not been fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, various parameters of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis were studied in 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 13 sex-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified into three subgroups according to the number of clinical signs involved; group I (no sign): 4 patients; group II (one or two signs): 11 patients; group III (more than three signs): 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, showed an activation of blood coagulation, such as the shortening of prothrombin time (p less than 0.001), decreases in concentrations and activities of plasma antithrombin III (AT-III) (p less than 0.01) and elevated levels of plasma thrombin-antithrombin-III complex (TAT) (p less than 0.01), compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels (p less than 0.01) and activities (p less than 0.01) of protein C (PC) and total protein S (PS) levels (p less than 0.05) were increased in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor (p less than 0.001) also indicated an activation of fibrinolysis in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When analyzed among the subgroups, patients belong to group II and III showed higher levels of plasma FDP D-dimer (p less than 0.05) and lower levels of plasminogen (p less than 0.05), as compared with patients in group I or control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
