<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the effect of smoking on the symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty asymptomatic current smokers (CS) who promised to stop smoking (group 1) and 60 current non-smokers (NS) (group 2) (21 of them ex-smokers) with BD were examined at the beginning and a week later for the presence of symptoms of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven of the 50 CS completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were observed in 31 (65.9%) of them at the end of the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides oral aphthous lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> were detected in two and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum in two other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 15 (25%) group 2 patients developed oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The difference between the frequencies of oral aphthous lesions in these groups was significant (p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that cessation of cigarette smoking can activate the mucocutaneous symptoms, especially oral aphthous lesions, in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
