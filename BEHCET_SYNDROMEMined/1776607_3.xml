<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Streptococcus (S.) sanguis in the flora of patients with this disease was always higher than that of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that serotypes of S. sanguis in the oral flora of patients were different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immune responses against S. sanguis were also examined in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antibody titers against S. sanguis were higher in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to S. sanguis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that uncommon serotypes of S. sanguis play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
