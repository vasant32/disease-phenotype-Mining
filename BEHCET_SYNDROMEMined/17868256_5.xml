<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTPN22 R620W polymorphism has a wide variation of allelic frequencies among different populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism is investigated in Turkish patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> with immune activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from 134 patients with BD and 177 healthy controls are genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism method for the SNP (rs2476601, A/G) of PTPN22 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphic region was amplified by PCR and digested with XcmI enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of heterozygous genotype (AG) was 5.1% (9/177) in control group, whereas polymorphic allele was not present in the whole BD group (P = 0.012, OR 0.65, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the lower prevalence in the general population and the absence in BD show the limited role of PTPN22 polymorphism in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> in Turkey </plain></SENT>
