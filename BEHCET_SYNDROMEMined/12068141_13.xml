<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B51 allele is known to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) in many ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not yet been clarified whether the HLA-B51 gene itself is the pathogenic gene related to BD or whether it is some other gene in linkage disequlibrium with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the Triplet repeat (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/AGC) polymorphism in transmembrane region of the MHC class I chain-related A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>) gene was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> with BD, we studied the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> polymorphism in 108 Korean BD patients and 204 healthy controls in relation to the presence of HLA-B51 and clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The triplet repeat polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis (PAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotype frequency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*A6 allele (relative risk, RR=2.15, p=0.002) and HLA-B51(RR=1.87, p=0.022) were significantly increased in the Korean patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*A6 and HLA-B51 in both the patients with BD and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*A6 homozygosity was strongly associated with BD in the HLA-B51-negative population, and HLA-B51 was also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*A6-negative population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*A6 rather than HLA-B51 was strongly associated with Korean patients with BD, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>*A6 allele is a useful susceptibility marker of BD, especially in the HLA-B5-negative </plain></SENT>
