<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 22 patients with active BD; 15 age- and sex-matched healthy adults served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IFN-alpha (3 million units subcutaneously) was given to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients twice a week for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty of twenty-two patients experienced clinical improvement with this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-treatment serum levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-alpha2-receptor (TNFalpha2R), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), and E-selectin were measured by sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline E-selectin, TNF-alpha, and TNF-alpha2R levels of the patients were increased in comparison with the control group and post-treatment values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, IL-2 and IL-2R levels did not change either with treatment or compared with the control group levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results confirm the previously described efficacy of IFN-alpha in the treatment of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of TNF-alpha, TNF-alpha2R, and E-selectin are prominently increased during active stage of the disease, indicating presence of immune system activation and endothelial injury/activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement of the pathological cytokinemia and endothelial disturbance accompany interferon-alpha-induced disease remission </plain></SENT>
