<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify the morphologic appearance of keratic precipitates (KPs) with in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) in uveitic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 75 eyes of 72 patients with a mean age of 38.6+/-15.1 years who had active intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and whose corneas had KP on slit-lamp examination were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IVCM (Confoscan 3.0, Vigonza, Italy) was used to image the part of the corneal endothelium in which KP were most densely deposited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>KP were classified into five groups: type I (small, round), type II (stippled), type III (dendritiform), type IV (large, smooth-rounded), and type V (globular) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When more than one type of KP was observed with IVCM, a distinction between the predominant and the less frequent KP was made as 'primary' and 'secondary' KP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 50 (66.7%) eyes more than one type of KP was imaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The size of the KP ranged between 5 and 150 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most frequently observed primary KP type in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease was type I (100%), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> type II (57.1%), in Fuchs' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> syndrome type III (85.7%), in granulomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> type V (42.9%), in infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> type III (66.7%), and in juvenile idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> type I (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The KP types showed a statistically significant difference between different uveitic syndromes (Fisher's exact test, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Certain KP types appear to be characteristic of various uveitic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IVCM may have a potential role in the diagnostic work-up of uveitic patients </plain></SENT>
