<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leptin, a recently discovered neuroendocrine hormone, is a metabolic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that appears to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum proinflammatory cytokines upregulate leptin levels and leptin itself directly induces nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production from endothelial cells with its specific receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To detect changes of serum leptin concentrations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome compared with age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether disease activity or the duration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome correlates with leptin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (41.2 +/- 8.4 years, 16 male, 19 female) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects (40.4 +/- 10.91 years, nine male, 11 female) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The body mass index (BMI) [weight (kg) height(-1) (m(2))] was calculated for subjects at study enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We measured serum leptin with a leptin enzyme immunoassay kit, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical analysis and P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Values were expressed as mean +/- SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The gender ratio, age and BMI were not substantially different among <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean serum leptin concentrations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (16.8 +/- 7.49 ng mL(-1)) were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher than in healthy control volunteers (7.5 +/- 2.77 ng mL(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients had significantly (P = 0.001) higher leptin concentrations (20.5 +/- 7.99 ng mL(-1)) when compared with patients in inactive periods (12.8 +/- 4.43 ng mL(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with longer disease duration (mean, 20.1 +/- 5.15 years) had also significantly (P = 0.013) higher leptin concentrations (20.2 +/- 8.52 ng mL(-1)) than those with shorter disease duration (13.4 +/- 4.52 ng mL(-1)) (mean, 7.4 +/- 3.29 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reaction parameters were found to be significantly (for each, P &lt; 0.01) increased in active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leptin may have a role in modulating endothelial function and may be involved in mechanisms for vessel endothelium repair, during an exacerbation as well as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
