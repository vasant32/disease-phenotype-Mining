<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e>, being a well known risk factor for atherothrombogenesis, is also a contributive risk factor for the pathogenesis and the activation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four patients fulfilling the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (48 males, 16 females, 33+/-8 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were separated into two groups with respect to activation features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we collected the blood samples from 13 patients with BD in both active stage and in inactive stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six healthy individuals were included as a negative control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) levels were determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations in total BD patients were significantly higher than in the healthy controls (11.7+/-4.6 versus 8.7+/-2.8micromol/L, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations in the active patients were significantly higher than in the inactive patients and the healthy controls (13.3+/-3.6; 10.8+/-5.0; 8.7+/-2.8micromol/L, respectively) (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the patients with inactive disease and the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When the active and the inactive stage of 13 patients with BD were compared, we found that mean serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were higher in the active stage than in the inactive stage (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinaemia</z:e> may be responsible for the endothelial damage in BD and assumed to be a risk factor and a marker for activation of BD </plain></SENT>
