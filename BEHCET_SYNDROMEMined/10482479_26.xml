<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Retrospective evaluation of epidemiological features and visual prognosis of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) who visited the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1974 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: During the survey period, more than 100 new patients with BD visited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> clinic in each 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of new patients decreased in the most recent 5-year period from 1989 to 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although BD has always been more prevalent in men, the percentage of women has increased to 24.7% (19/77) in the most recent 5-year survey period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients who initially manifested ocular symptoms in their third or fourth decade was more than 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the incomplete type of BD gradually had increased to 62.3% (48/77) by 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the extraocular major symptoms, oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphtha</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> have been frequent and genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> has become less frequent in the last 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients whose visual acuity was better than 0.4 at the first visit in the 1984-1993 period had a significantly better visual prognosis than the patients in the previous 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main drug therapy consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in the earlier 10-year period, and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> in the later 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is still one of the most frequently encountered types of endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There have been some changes in the epidemiological features of the patients with BD over the past 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The introduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> in 1985 is probably responsible for the improvement of the visual prognosis in BD patients </plain></SENT>
