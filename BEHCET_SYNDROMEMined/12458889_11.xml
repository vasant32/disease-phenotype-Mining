<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) levels and CuZn-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were increased, while serum transferrin (Trf) levels were diminished in patients with active ocular BD (n = 19), inactive ocular BD (n=18), and nonocular BD (n=15), compared to healthy controls (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels in patients with active ocular BD and nonocular BD were significantly higher than in the inactive ocular BD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with active ocular BD also had significantly higher serum Cu-Zn SOD activities, compared to the inactive ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were higher in patients with active ocular BD, inactive ocular BD, and nonocular BD, compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with active ocular BD and nonocular BD had significantly higher ESR and serum CRP levels, compared to the inactive ocular BD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum albumin concentrations showed no significant differences among the BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors speculate that in BD patients, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals may be dismutated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> by increased CuZn-SOD activity and the conversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> may be enhanced by iron, owing to diminished serum Trf; these mechanisms may contribute to the increased serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
