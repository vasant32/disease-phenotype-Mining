<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormalities were an increase of motor evoked potential latency and a delay of central motor conduction time (CMCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 out of 9 BD patients with pyramidal signs central motor conduction changes were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 2 out of 7 patients without neurologic signs and symptoms showed an increased threshold and a prolonged CMCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data obtained suggest that this technique is useful not only to confirm the neurologic impairment but also to reveal subclinical or pre-symptomatic central motor involvement in BD subjects </plain></SENT>
