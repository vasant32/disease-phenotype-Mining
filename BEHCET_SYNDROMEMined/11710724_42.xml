<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> is a widely used treatment for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, even though in a previous 6-month controlled study, it was shown to be effective only in controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reassessed the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome in a study conducted among a larger group of patients for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomized 116 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (60 male/56 female), who had active mucocutaneous disease without eye or major organ involvement, to receive either placebo or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (1-2 mg/day, adjusted to body weight) in a double-blind trial for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the sustained absence of any lesions during treatment (complete response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome measure was the difference in the number of mucocutaneous lesions or arthritic joints between the active drug and placebo arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women and men were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-four patients (72%; 45 male, 39 female) completed the 24-month study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analyses showed significantly more complete responses in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment group in terms of reduced occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (P = 0.004), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (P = 0.004), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (P = 0.033) among the women, and reduced occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (P = 0.012) among the men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (P = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum lesions (P = 0.002), and arthritic joints (P = 0.014) among the women were less in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> group, and the mean number of arthritic joints (P = 0.026) among the men was less in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> may be useful for treating some of the manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, especially among women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This might be a reflection of less severe disease among the women </plain></SENT>
