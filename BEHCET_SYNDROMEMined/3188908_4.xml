<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The membranocystic structures, which were derived from degenerative fat cells with a loss of the cell membrane, were observed in the edematous connective tissues accompanied by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> and diapedesis of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic evaluation revealed two different patterns of peculiar membranous structures in the cytoplasm of the degenerative fat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One was proliferating membrane structures such as well developed Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum, and the other was minute tubular structures such as intracytoplasmic microvesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These degenerative fat cells are considered to be derived from abnormal fat cells which lack a cell membrane, but whose cellular and nuclear configurations appear to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> morphologically, because the cytoplasm of these abnormal cells showed the same tubular structures as those seen in the characteristic architecture of membranocystic lesion-like change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relation between the appearance of such abnormal cells and the pathologic conditions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome was discussed </plain></SENT>
