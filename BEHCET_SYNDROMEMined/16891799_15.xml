<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have conducted an analysis of the TNFA haplotypes in the promoter response element that affect the binding affinity of specific transcription factors, in order to characterize their association with the clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six polymorphisms in the promoter region of TNFA were genotyped in 254 BD patients and 344 control subjects, via the PCR-RFLP technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TNFA -1031*C, -863*A and -308*G alleles were associated with an increased risk of BD (p=0.030, OR=1.4; p=0.008, OR=1.5; p=0.010, OR=1.8, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sole TNFA haplotype -1031C-863A-857C-376G-308G-238G, was associated with a 1.6 fold increase in the risk of BD, whereas the TNFA haplotype -1031T-863C-857C-376G-308A-238G was associated with a 0.6 decreased risk of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TNFA -1031*C, -863*A, -857*C and -308*G alleles were significantly associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study, collectively, indicate that TNFA haplotypes in the promoter response elements may exert significant influence on susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
