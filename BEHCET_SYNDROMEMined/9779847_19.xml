<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients having active BD were entered into a 6 month open label trial of IFN-alpha therapy given by self-administered dose of 3 million units subcutaneously daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Provision was made for downward or upward dosing depending on predetermined responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four study centers followed the same protocol </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients completed the trial, while 3 were removed at 3 and 4 months for side effects or lack of efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a substantial reduction in the number of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, cutaneous lesions, and articular signs and symptoms by the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pain scores, global assessments, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dose also declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The IFN-alpha dose at end of study averaged 1.5 million units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant side effects, besides the anticipated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1558931" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">flu-like syndrome</z:e> experienced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, included single instances of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that IFN-alpha is effective therapy for some manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
