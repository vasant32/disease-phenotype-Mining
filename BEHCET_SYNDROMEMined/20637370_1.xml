<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, we identify risk determinants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 82 BD patients (n = 26 males) and 89 healthy controls (n = 40 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were collected at the time of enrollment, and serum resistin and adiponectin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) was calculated by measuring fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BD patients and healthy controls differed significantly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (HOMA-IR) (1.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.5, p&lt;0.001) and serum resistin level (7901.7 +/- 1314.9 vs. 7444.2 +/- 1841.6, p = 0.001) but not in serum adiponectin level (p = 0.223) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences in HOMA-IR, serum adiponectin, and serum resistin were found between patients with active and inactive BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is determined that plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, plasma insulin, and serum resistin may be determinant for the HOMA-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> components is closely correlated with HOMA-IR in BD patients (r = 0.245, p = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that there is an increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in patients with BD as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum resistin level may be an independent determinant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
