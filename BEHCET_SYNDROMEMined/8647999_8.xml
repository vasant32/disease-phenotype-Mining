<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the prognosis of ROU by performing prospective evaluations of 67 patients who had only a history of ROU and were registered at the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Specialty Clinic at Severance Hospital of Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (52.2%) developed overt manifestations of BD at an average of 7.7 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ROU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of recurrence was 9.8 times per year in progressive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these results, it appears that highly recurrent ROU is a warning signal for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Careful examinations of patients, including their minor symptoms, additional laboratory tests, and regular follow-ups by physicians are required for proper diagnosis </plain></SENT>
