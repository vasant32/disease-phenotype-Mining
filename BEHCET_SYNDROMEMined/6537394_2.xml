<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 8 cases, the EEGs showed a mild to moderate increase in slowed alpha and theta waves and in 5 cases diffuse alpha patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, large slow wave patterns were observed and in Case 10, large slow waves changed into low voltage fast dominant patterns following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases, the EEG changes seemed to be well correlated with the clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our present study suggested that the diffuse alpha patterns were only seen in cases with the least affected brain stem diffuse projection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the investigation of the sequential alterations of large slow waves in Case 10, it was suggested that a synchronization mechanism would lie in the medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
