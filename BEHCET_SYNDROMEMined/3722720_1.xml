<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study plasma exchanges were applied in an attempt to remove circulating immune complexes and restore cellular immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High doses of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> were administered in association with plasma exchanges since it has been shown that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 might be involved in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with severe ocular manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma exchanges were carried out at the rate of 3 per week during 3 weeks and then once every two weeks during 3 months followed by 1 per month during 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>45 mg/day/kg <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> were administered intravenously for 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of the follow-up period comparative analysis of panretinal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographies before and after treatment showed no change of the fundus lesions in 3 patients, improvement in only 2 patients and significant worsening in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rather negative results of the present trial lead to assume that HSV-1 is not the virus involved, if any, in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the present study, the efficiency of plasma exchanges was transient </plain></SENT>
