<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, episodic disease with an often devastating course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> levels in patients with BD and to compare them with those in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were collected from the Dermatology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twelve patients with BD and 95 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated by Beck's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> inventory (BDI), Beck's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> inventory (BAI), automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ), and Beck's hopelessness scale (BHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group with BD had higher scores for BDI, BAI, ATQ, and BHS than the group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost one-half of the patients with BD had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BAI only was higher in the younger BD group than in the corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> group, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test scores were higher in the older BD group than in the corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a strong correlation between the duration of BD and BDI, ATQ, and BHS scores, which was not observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BD increased the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> risk four-fold in this sample, and BD with a duration of over 3 years increased the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> risk 12-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, BD patients had higher levels of psychopathology than did <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> patients in terms of psychologic test scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The duration of illness affected the severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> in the BD group, but not in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The duration of illness was a major risk factor for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the need for early recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852553" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric symptoms</z:e> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
