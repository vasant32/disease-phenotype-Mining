<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous publications report increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> production by neutrophils and macrophages, increases in cytokines and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), as well as low levels of enzymatic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defenses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: We looked for another marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease: the presence of clastogenic factors (CF) in patients' plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined plasma endproducts of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 20 patients and 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clastogenic activity was evaluated by means of cytogenetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This test (CF test) detects circulating prooxidants, due to their clastogenic effects after exposure of lymphocyte cultures of healthy persons to plasma ultrafiltrates from patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clastogenic prooxidants are <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products and cytokines, in particular TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation was evaluated by the Yagi method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CF test was positive in 18 out of 20 patients, while it was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 control persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean increase in chromosomal breaks was 10.6 +/- 3.8 in cultures exposed to patients' plasma and 1.3 +/- 2.4 for cultures receiving control plasma (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clastogenic effect of patients' plasma ultrafiltrates was significantly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1), suggesting an important role of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical in the clastogenic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">Thiobarbituric-acid</z:chebi>-reactive substances (expressed as nanomoles <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> per milliliter) were also significantly increased in these patients: 10.6 +/- 3.2 for patients and 6.6 +/- 1.4 for controls (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of CF in the plasma of patients, indicating the presence of circulating prooxidants with chromosome-damaging effects, confirms an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The anticlastogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase in vitro suggests the implication of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were also significantly increased in patients </plain></SENT>
