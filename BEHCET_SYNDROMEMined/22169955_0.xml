<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Brazil, BD occurs as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe clinical and radiological features of 36 Brazilian patients of mixed ethnicity with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (NBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records of 178 BD patients were reviewed and 36 (20%) NBD patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one NBD patients (58.3%) were female and 27 (75%) presented with parenchymal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brainstem involvement was the most common neurologic syndrome (41.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> (27.8%), isolated aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (16.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> (ON) (16.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) (8.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> (2.8%), and spinal cord involvement (5.6%) were other neurologic manifestations observed among Brazilian NBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (50%) had at least one relapse, and isolated aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> was the most common relapsing manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences concerning the number of relapses between parenchymal and non-parenchymal groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A multivariate model including disease duration, cell count in spinal fluid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> use, immunosuppressive use at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, age at NBD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and ON did not reveal any significant associations with NBD relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a low frequency of CVT and an unexpected higher number of isolated aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Brazilian NBD patients present more parenchymal and atypical manifestations, and relapse more often than NBD patients from other populations </plain></SENT>
