<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated the calcific degeneration of bioprosthetic aortic valves in patients who had been given steroid treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> in order to evaluate the immune response to glutaraldehyde-preserved bioprostheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valves were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 48.4 years (range: 27 to 64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>Aortitis</z:mp> was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> disease in eight patients and to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bioprosthetic valves used included bovine pericardial xenografts (n = 8) and porcine aortic valves (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean daily dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was 10.1 mg (range: 2.5 to 60 mg); mean duration of therapy was 8.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean patient follow up, using echocardiography, was 11.5 years (range: 8.5 to 16 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total follow up period was 115 patient-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow up, three reoperations were required because of valve detachment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the aortic cusp, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic insufficiency</z:hpo> with coronary orifice stenosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No reoperations were required for stenotic degeneration of the bioprosthetic valves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven bioprosthetic valves were still functioning between 8.5 and 16 years after implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Calcific degeneration in two of three bovine pericardial valves that required replacing was surprisingly minimal; separation of collagen fibers in the valves by infiltration with plasma proteins was also minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the calcific degeneration of bioprosthetic valves may be decreased by concomitant steroid therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0010139'>aortitis</z:mp>, though further research will be required to confirm this effect and to determine the mechanism(s) involved </plain></SENT>
