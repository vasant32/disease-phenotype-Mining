<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of the features associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) in a young men population and generate a proportional Venn diagram of those features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data was collected from 3714 otherwise healthy men recruited for military service at the entrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study was conducted in a two-step procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Firstly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were questioned by a general practitioner via using visual <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those participants, in whom at least one BD-related manifestation of the disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo>, genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, venous involvement of the lower extremities) have been demonstrated, were further examined by a rheumatologist at the second-stage of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The areas of intersection among the 6 individual BD-related manifestations produced 63 mutually exclusive symptom groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen out 63 of these groups were functionally operative in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven (1.2%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants were considered to have at least 1 of the BD-related manifestation after examined by rheumatologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rates of the individual manifestations among the study population were as follows; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> 29 (0.78%), <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> 31 (0.83%), genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> 9 (0.24%), venous involvement 13 (0.35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum 4 (0.10%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> 3 (0.08%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The group consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> was the largest proportion of participants followed by the group having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> only, accounting for 0.29% and 0.18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four (0.1%) of the participants were fulfilled the International Study Group for BD criteria following rheumatologic and ophthalmologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After excluding the group having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp>, additional 12 cases had features suggesting BD though they didn't fulfill the International Study Group for BD criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Venn diagram of this study demonstrates that International Study Group for BD criteria can detect almost the quarter of 16 cases suspected as having BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the application of information regarding the frequencies of individual BD-related manifestations and their association with each other in a general population might serve as a helpful tool for physicians while making diagnosis </plain></SENT>
