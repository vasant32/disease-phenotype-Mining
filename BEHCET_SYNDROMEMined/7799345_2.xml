<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e> (SS) accompanies most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus we investigated the prevalence of SS in BS in a formal protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted in 2 phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the first phase subjective symptoms of dryness were blindly assessed by questionnaires and Schirmer I and Saxon tests were done in 67 patients with BS and 100 healthy and diseased controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 2nd phase 30 patients with BS and 19 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) had salivary gland biopsies along with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> dye, Schirmer I and tear breakup time tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first phase only patients with primary SS had significantly abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However during the 2nd phase pathologic changes in salivary gland biopsies and positive RB tests were highly significantly more prevalent among patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SS is not a feature of BS </plain></SENT>
