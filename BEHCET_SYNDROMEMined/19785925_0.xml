<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 24 sex- and age-matched controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pure tone and high frequency audiometric tests were performed and pure tone average hearing thresholds calculated for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient evoked otoacoustic emission testing was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pure tone audiometry showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in 15 of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hearing thresholds were significantly higher in the study group than in the control group, on both pure tone frequency (except 0.5 kHz) and high frequency audiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant reductions in transient evoked otoacoustic emission amplitude were found at 1.4 and 2 kHz in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in reproducibility, stimulus intensity or stability, comparing the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significantly lower mid-frequency amplitudes were found in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients on transient evoked otoacoustic emission testing </plain></SENT>
