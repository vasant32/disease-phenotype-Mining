<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, therapeutic and preventive effects are not observed in some patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> on proinflammatory cytokine expression and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with BD are associated with responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Activation of caspase-1, transcription and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α and IL-6, and release of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH) in PBMCs isolated from healthy controls and patients with BD were analysed in the presence or absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and upon stimulation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) plus a caspase-1 activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> significantly modulated monosodium urate-induced IL-1β release, LPS-stimulated LDH release, and basal transcript levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in healthy controls and BD <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> responders, but not in BD <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> showed contrasting effects on LPS-stimulated IL-1β transcription, i.e. it increased in responders but decreased in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, higher levels of TNF-α and IL-6 transcripts were observed in LPS-stimulated PBMCs from nonresponders compared with responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows different effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> on PBMCs from patients with BD according to their responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predicting responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in patients with BD may, therefore, be possible by examining alterations in IL-1β transcript levels in LPS-stimulated PBMCs after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
