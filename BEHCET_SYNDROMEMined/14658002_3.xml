<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurement of antiannexin V antibodies may be of value in confirming diagnosis and evaluating the risk of venous and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficiency of antiannexin V antibody in the formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 53 male patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease according to international study group criteria were involved in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age range was 20-28 years (mean 23+/-3.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients had been taking colchicum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those taking medications that interfere with antiannexin V autoantibody levels were excluded, and serum samples were taken during the active period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group I included 26 Behçet's patients with well-documented <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, group II included 27 Behçet's patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and group III was comprised of 27 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences between the mean concentrations of IgG and IgM antiannexin V autoantibodies in the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that these antibodies may not be associated with the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
