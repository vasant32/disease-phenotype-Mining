<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To examine retrospectively the features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with familial occurrence and make a comparison between familial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with ocular lesions and those without ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We sent questionnaires about <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with familial occurrence to 114 hospitals that reported treating such patients in previous nationwide hospital surveys, and to 341 hospitals selected at random in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We obtained reports on 83 Behçet's patients with familial occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of HLA-B51 was 53.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of HLA-B51 among patients with ocular lesions was 64.0%, that in patients without ocular lesions was 14.3%, and that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> was 40.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean birth year and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> year of the patients with ocular symptoms was significantly lower than that of the patients without ocular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant difference between these two groups, parent-child involvement was more common among the patients without ocular lesions than in those with ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the number of familial <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with ocular lesions and high HLA-B51 positivity has been decreasing recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the etiology of familial occurrence, larger scale epidemiological studies and further molecular studies of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease are needed </plain></SENT>
