<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology and pathogenesis of this syndrome remain obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, various factors are suspected, including genetic propensity, infectious precipitants, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering the chronicity and unclear etiology of the disease, we conducted a prospective investigation of a possible alteration in the bone mineral density of affected persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients (18 males and 17 females, mean age 38.02+/-7.93 years) diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 33 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (14 males and 19 females, mean age 40.06+/-7.66 years) were seen on an outpatient basis, and bone densitometry measurements were done from June 2000 to December 2002 at the Mersin University Hospital in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postmenopausal women with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and patients receiving oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean disease duration was 6.68+/-7.05 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density was measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine and right femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean Z scores of the patient and control groups were -0.50+/-1.06 and -0.13+/-0.92 at the lumbar spine, respectively, and 0.38+/-1.07 and 0.45+/-1.20 at the right femur, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in bone mineral density values were detected in the groups at either the lumbar (P = 0.15) or right femur (P = 0.82) site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Body mass index and disease duration did not influence bone mineral density, and age had a positive correlation with bone mineral density in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although it is difficult to draw definite conclusions due to the relatively small sample size, our study confirms that bone mineral density in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was not lower than in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
