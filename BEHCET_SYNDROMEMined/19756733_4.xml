<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our treatment protocol in disease with vascular involvement in seven pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients met the international criteria for the disease before the age of 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one was a girl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vascular involvement was as follows: Two patients had superficial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, two patients had atrial or ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, one had arterial involvement with pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and two had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinuses in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of vascular involvement was 4 months (range 3-24 months) after the diagnosis of BD and was concomitant with diagnosis in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ones with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the venous system received additional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, whereas those with pulmonary arterial or cardiac involvement initially received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> for 150-180 mg/kg total dose (IV or oral) and then were switched to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> for a further 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except the patient with pulmonary arterial involvement received a course of anticoagulation treatment as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients have been followed up for a period of at least 18 months and so far are free of vascular relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One has developed a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> necessitating further therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, features of vascular involvement should be carefully sought for in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Effective management has enabled disease-free survival in the presented patients </plain></SENT>
