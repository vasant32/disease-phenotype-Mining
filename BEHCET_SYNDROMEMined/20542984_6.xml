<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the relationship between recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and timing of infliximab in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts were retrospectively reviewed for 23 patients with refractory uveoretinitis associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease treated using infliximab at our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Infliximab was administered by intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and infliximab infusion was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean duration of infliximab treatment for the 23 patients was 20 months, and the mean number of infliximab infusions was 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> was seen during treatment in 13 of 23 patients, with no recurrences in the remaining 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed recurrence soon after starting treatment-for example, first recurrence after starting infliximab was on day 19 or day 29, but the other 11 patients experienced recurrences after 5-6 months of infliximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As regards the timing of recurrences following infliximab infusion, 10 of the 13 patients developed recurrences ∼5 weeks after infliximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in these patients most often occurred during weeks 7-8 after infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, three of the patients developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> at various times, for example in weeks 1, 4, 7 and 8 after infliximab infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab is effective for suppressing recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but responses to infliximab differ among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful observation following infliximab infusion is necessary to manage the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> during treatment </plain></SENT>
