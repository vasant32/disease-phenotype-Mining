<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from seven patients who had idiopathic orbital <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and who were evaluated at three medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with infliximab after the failure of traditional therapy, which included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, radiotherapy, or anti-inflammatory chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients had a favorable response to treatment with infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> required supplemental oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pain, swelling, and need for concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were the primary measures of treatment success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of comorbid disease in four patients also improved (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohn disease</z:e> in two, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> in one, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no untoward effects of treatment after a mean follow-up of 15.7 months (range, 4 to 31 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with infliximab appears to offer another therapeutic option in cases of recalcitrant or recurrent idiopathic orbital <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in which conventional treatment fails </plain></SENT>
