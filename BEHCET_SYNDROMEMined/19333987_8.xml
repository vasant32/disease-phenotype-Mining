<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical findings, treatment, outcome, and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) in a large cohort of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) from a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reported a series of 64 consecutive patients with CVT who fulfilled the international criteria for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed to define factors that affect prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among a cohort of 820 patients with BD, CVT was present in 64 (7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with BD patients without CVT, those with CVT had lower parenchymal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement (4.7% versus 28.7%; P = 0.0001) and higher extraneurologic vascular lesions (62.5% versus 38.8%; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up to 90% of patients responded to anticoagulation therapy without severe hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither steroid nor <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> use provided better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> was the main complication of CVT, being found in 15% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR] 7.1, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.6-31.9) and concurrent prothrombotic risk factors (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.1-20.2) were independently associated with the occurrence of sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with relapse of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were concurrent prothrombotic risk factors (hazard ratio [HR] 4.9, 95% CI 1.5-15.4) and a peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (HR 2.8, 95% CI 0.7-10.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a mean +/- SD followup of 8.2 +/- 6.9 years, 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> unrelated to CVT were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CVT in patients with BD may result in serious neurologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation represents a safe and effective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Extensive investigation of prothrombotic disorders should be considered </plain></SENT>
