<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A previously well 39 year old woman presented with severe localized and painful anorectal ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no other associated symptoms apart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> of the hips and fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of definitive tissue diagnosis, a presumptive diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a period of progression, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and ulceration subsided with conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following a relatively symptom-free period of 7 years, painful ulceration recurred in the same segment of bowel, which was refractory to steroid therapy but responded to defunctioning of the rectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon excision of the defunctioned rectum, multiple discrete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> developed in the remaining colon, with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> from the distal sigmoid colon to the midline wound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient simultaneously developed painful apthous ulceration of the mouth and throat, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustules</z:mpath> appeared on the perianal skin and trunk for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A colectomy was performed, with good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathology of the colonic lesions is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The characteristic appearance of these lesions, together with associated 'major' and 'minor' clinical criteria, enabled a diagnosis of Bechet's disease to be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although there is some overlap, particularly in the distribution of this condition with Crohn's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo>, the pathologic appearances in Bechet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> are relatively distinct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of Bechet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> should not be excluded in a patient presenting with atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, even if associated clinical criteria are not simultaneously present </plain></SENT>
