<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, little information is available on the extent of vascular involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who are free of vascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study comprised 34 individuals with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who were free of vascular symptoms and 47 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both groups underwent non-invasive peripheral vascular examination consisting of Doppler, photoplethysmography, and segmental pressure measurements and determination of ankle-brachial pressure and femoro-brachial pressure indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>Venous insufficiency</z:hpo> was detected in 22 of 68 lower extremities examined in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease group and in ten of 94 in the controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of extremities with an ankle-brachial pressure index of less than 1.00 for both the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, was significantly higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease group (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The femoro-brachial pressure index was significantly higher in the controls than in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease group (1.32 versus 1.23 for the right leg, P &lt; 0.05; 1.31 versus 1.22 for the left leg, P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular symptom-free patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease seem to have a high incidence of peripheral vascular involvement compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
