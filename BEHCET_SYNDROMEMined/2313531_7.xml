<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preparations were made for examination with both light and scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Along with known changes in the gingival epithelial structure observed following CsA treatment, we also found unusual clusters of needle-like crystallites embedded in the epithelium, mostly at the base of the acanthotic projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Toluidin blue staining revealed increased numbers of both intact and degranulated mast cells in the attached epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CsA affects the gingival epithelium and that the clinically observed enlargement of gingival tissue following prolonged treatment with CsA is due primarily to CsA-epithelial interaction </plain></SENT>
