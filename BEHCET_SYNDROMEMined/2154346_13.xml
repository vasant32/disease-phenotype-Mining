<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sera from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients revealed an IFN-gamma increase but no correlation between IFN level and natural killer (NK) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis of lymphocyte subsets by monoclonal antibodies registered an increase of CD8+ T subpopulation and cells co-expressing CD8(+)-Leu7a+ markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a high number of cells expressing CD25+ and HLA-DR+ phenotype has been noted in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serological analysis showed a high level of IgG antibodies to HSV-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase of IFN-gamma titre, the high number of activated T cells and the increasing level of IgG antibodies to HSV-1 are important manifestations during the active stage of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in relation to the immunopathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
