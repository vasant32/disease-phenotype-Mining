<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of thoracic involvement in BD and its correlation with the number of diagnostic BD criteria of The International Study Group (ISG), gender, disease duration, and the presence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two BD patients, who had consecutively applied to different clinics in Turgut Ozal Medical Center Research Hospital, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were either newly diagnosed or already under treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by standard chest roentgenogram, spirometry, and thorax CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perfusion scintigraphies were obtained in patients with thoracic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thoracic pathologic conditions were found in five patients (11.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> thoracic pathologic conditions appeared in patients with at least four diagnostic criteria (26 patients) of the ISG for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup, the rate of thoracic involvement was 19.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, 25% of the patients with pulmonary symptoms (12 patients) had thoracic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Gender and the duration of the disease did not correlate with thoracic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the rate of thoracic involvement in BD is greater than is generally believed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increased number of diagnostic BD criteria of the ISG may indicate other organ system involvement and an increased risk of thoracic pathosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> BD patients with at least four diagnostic criteria or any pulmonary symptoms should be evaluated for thoracic involvement, which is a major menace to life and necessitates early intervention </plain></SENT>
