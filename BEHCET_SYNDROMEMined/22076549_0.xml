<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine the frequency and type of neurologic involvement in pediatric patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of 728 patients with a diagnosis of neuro-BD (NBD) of 2 large BD cohorts followed in Istanbul University were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of both systemic and neurologic symptoms at or before age 16 (pediatric neuro-BD) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with NBD were compared with adult patients with NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 26 cases with pediatric BD (3.6%) and 702 (96.4%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gender ratio was equal in the general pediatric BD cohort, whereas male/female ratio was 5.5/1 in pediatric NBD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean age at BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and neurologic involvement <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were 13.0 ± 3.0 and 13.5 ± 2.4, respectively, and in the adult population mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD was 26.7 ± 8.0 and neurologic involvement occurred a mean of 5.3 ± 4.5 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical and MRI evaluation revealed that 3 children had <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> parenchymal involvement and 23 had dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (88.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed parenchymal involvement in 74.8% of the adults, contrary to the low 17.2% of cases with venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric NBD comprises 3.6% of our whole NBD cohort, with a male predominance, mainly in the form of dural venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, whereas in the adult NBD population the dominant form of neurologic involvement is parenchymal, suggesting that the pathogenesis of NBD may be different according to the age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
