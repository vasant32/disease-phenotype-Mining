<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A higher prevalence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients has been described compared to the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e> and BD could be genetically related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened a cohort of 50 BD patients and 100 healthy subjects for the common MEFV and TNFRSF 1A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An initial screening of exons 10 and 2 of the MEFV gene and exon 4 of the TNFRSF 1A was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The heterozygous MEFV mutation (K695R) was found in one (2%) BD patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> mutations in the control group revealed that 5 (5%) individuals bore MEFV gene mutations (3 were heterozygous for the E148Q and 2 were heterozygous for the A744S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At codon 202, there were no differences in allele frequencies between BD and control population: 73%R 27%Q in the BD patients vs 75%R 25%Q in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concerning mutations in the TNFRSF 1A gene, the R92Q mutation was present in heterozygous state in one (2%) BD patient and in 4 (4%) controls without differences between allele frequencies: 99%R 1%Q in BD patients vs 98%R 2%Q in controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the clinical manifestations of BD patients and the presence of a particular polymorphism or a mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRAPS</z:e> are genetically associated with BD in our cohort of Spanish patients </plain></SENT>
