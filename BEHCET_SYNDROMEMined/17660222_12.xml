<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase type 22 (PTPN22 620W) has recently been described as a strong common genetic risk factor for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the association of PTPN22 620W in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from 270 patients with BD from the UK and the Middle East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 203) were collected from the same populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with idiopathic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> from the UK (n = 136) were used as disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PTPN22 620W was detected by SSP-PCR analysis and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed an inverse correlation between the presence of PTPN22 620W and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in either patient group tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a greatly reduced prevalence in Middle Eastern compared to UK patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, there was no association with either UK patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> compared with UK controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of PTPN22 620W was inversely associated with BD and the distribution of the SNP in the Middle East supports previous findings in the global prevalence </plain></SENT>
