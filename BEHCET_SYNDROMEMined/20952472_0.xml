<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: data suggest that the use of disease control groups and proper use of power calculations were neglected in published reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We surveyed these and other methodological shortcomings in reports published within the last decade about one specific topic, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reason that recognizing such methodological shortcomings will lead to better quality clinical and basic science articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: articles published in the 15 highest impact factor journals on rheumatology, ophthalmology, dermatology, and general medicine between January 1999 and January 2009 were searched for original reports on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study designs (study types and time element), control groups, demographic data, use of power calculations, and reporting of negative results were specifically tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: most studies on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> were cross-sectional (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prospective longitudinal studies were few (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a considerable proportion of papers (21%), some basic demographic data were missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Power calculations were rare (3%) even in randomized controlled trials and were not considered at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in clinical hypothesis-testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease control groups were present in slightly over half of clinical and laboratory original research, while just 13% of genetic association studies included disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 12% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reports concerned mainly negative outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: a considerable number of the published research articles have methodological weaknesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The generalizability of what we observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> to other research topics needs to be formally studied </plain></SENT>
