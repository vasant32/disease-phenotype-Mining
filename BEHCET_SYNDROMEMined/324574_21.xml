<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in the distribution of C3 within the first peak of Sephadex G200 fractionated plasma were found in nine of the 17 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (55%), three of the 11 patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, and none of eight controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings provide indirect evidence that immune complexes are found in the plasma of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immune complexes were more common in patients with the neuro-ocular type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome than in those with the mucocutaneous type, and in those with herpetiform <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> than in those with major or minor aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immune complexes were also associated with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that the formation of immune complexes is an important step in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
