<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether plasma levels of Lp(a) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (Lp(a)) are predictors of defective fibrinolytic activity, leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma Lp(a) was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> by enzymatic methods, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> A-I and B, fibrinogen (turbidimetric method), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and D-dimer levels by enzyme immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their levels and interactions were evaluated in 33 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (including five with thrombotic complications) and 30 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma Lp(a) concentration was significantly greater in the patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (27%) had levels &gt; 0.30 microgram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between Lp(a) and other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> apart from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) showed inverse correlation with t-PA (r = -0.34, p &lt; 0.05) and D-dimer (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with thrombotic complications had significantly greater Lp(a) and PAI-1, and lower D-dimer concentrations than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of plasma Lp(a) levels in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may provide useful information regarding the potential development of thrombotic events, because of its possible role in defective fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
