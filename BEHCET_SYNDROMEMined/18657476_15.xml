<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, SUMO4 polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the association of SUMO4 polymorphisms with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results showed a significantly increased frequency of the + 438 C allele and a significantly decreased frequency of the AGAT haplotype in BD patients (p=0.0002, corrected p=0.002; p=0.000015, corrected p=0.0002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis indicated that these significant associations only existed in the HLA-B51 negative subjects (p=0.004, corrected p=0.032; p=0.001, corrected p=0.016, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The GGAC haplotype was negatively associated with HLA-B51 positive BD patients (p=0.0007, corrected p=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SUMO4 +438 C allele is associated with susceptibility to BD in HLA-B51 negative patients, while the AGAT haplotype is protectively associated with BD in HLA-B51 negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GGAC haplotype is protectively associated with BD in HLA-B51 positive patients </plain></SENT>
