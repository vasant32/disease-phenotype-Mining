<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> and 31 matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding demographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of patients and controls were 13.76 (range: 4.00-35.79) and 18.97 (range: 12.05-36.94) ng/ml, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e>, 25-hydroxyvitamin D values were significantly lower than those of the healthy controls (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum Ca, P, and ALP levels were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum ESR and CRP levels were significantly higher in patients than controls (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and age, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, ESR, or CRP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis parameters showed that smoking, alcohol intake, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were the main predictors of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the parameters studied, the largest impact was due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> therapy (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We did not find a significant relationship between the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are decreased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Smoking, alcohol intake, and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> appear to affect <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
