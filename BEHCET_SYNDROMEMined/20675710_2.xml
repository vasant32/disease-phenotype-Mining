<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to the 641 adult members of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Syndrome Society in the UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants provided information on socio-demographic characteristics, disease duration, current symptoms (mouth <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, joint problems, stomach/bowel problems, eye problems, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and other neurological problems), symptom control and quality of life (the EQ-5D index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression was used to test the associations of the type and number of symptoms with the EQ-5D index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 447 members, 400 who returned the questionnaires had a confirmed diagnosis of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of them, 362 had information on the variables selected for this analysis (76% females and 94% white British) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean EQ-5D index was 0.47 (S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 symptoms assessed, joint problems had the strongest impact on quality of life, followed by neurological problems, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction and stomach/bowel problems (adjusted coefficients of -0.15, -0.13, -0.11 and -0.18, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the number of symptoms was significantly related to the EQ-5D index after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics, disease duration and symptom control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EQ-5D index decreased by -0.05 U for every additional symptom reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BS has a considerable impact on quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both the type and number of symptoms affect the quality of life of adults with BS </plain></SENT>
