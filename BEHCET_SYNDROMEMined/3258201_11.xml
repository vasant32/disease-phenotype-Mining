<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied natural killer (NK) cell activity and numbers in the peripheral blood obtained from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in inactive and convalescent stage, and from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ratios of helper/suppressor cells (OKT4/OKT8) were below 1.0 in patients with active stage and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the convalescent stage of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A relative increase of OKT8+ cells and at the same time of Leu 7+ cells was obtained in the active and convalescent BD stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Double marker analysis revealed that the sub-population of cells expressing both the T8+ and the Leu 7+ antigen (T8+/Leu 7+) was increased in patients with active stage, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the convalescent stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of cells reactive with Leu 11 monoclonal antibody (active NK cells) was evaluated in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from peripheral blood showed an increased sub-population of T8+/Leu 7+ double marker cells, and a decreased Leu 11+ cell sub-population in patients with active BD, but the majority of Leu 7+ cells in patients with convalescent stage lacked OKT8 antigen when investigated in a double marker system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A parallel increase of Leu 11+ cells was observed in the convalescent stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This phenotypic analysis was carried out with the NK in vitro functional evaluation of cell populations from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NK cell activity in the clinically active stage of BD was significantly lower than that of healthy controls and patients in the convalescent stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decrease of peripheral blood NK function in patients with active BD may be related to the presence of immature forms of NK cells and/or to the increased percentage of T8+/Leu 7+ cells </plain></SENT>
