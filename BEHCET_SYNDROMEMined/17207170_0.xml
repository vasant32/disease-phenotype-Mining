<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, multisystem, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> characterized by the predominance of T-helper 1 cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is also characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils into the affected tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because cytokines are involved in the regulation of lymphocyte and phagocyte functions, they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Leptin, a member of the gp 130 family of cytokines, induces a strong T-helper 1 response and is regarded as a proinflammatory inducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that serum leptin concentration was increased in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and correlated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the role of G2548A polymorphism of leptin gene in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and compare the results with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 93 subjects with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 125 healthy controls were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of G-2548A polymorphism of the LEP gene were performed using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotypes (GG, GA, and AA of leptin G2548A) and alleles (G and A of leptin 2548) were scored and the frequency was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the alleles and genotypes in patients and controls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We analysed the correlation between leptin gene polymorphism and the clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both genotype and allele frequencies were not significantly different between controls and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients [OR=0.67, 95% CI (0.35-1.29), P=0.197 and OR=0.77, 95% CI (0.52-1.15), P=0.184] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We did not find any significant relationship between leptin gene polymorphism and the clinical features of BD (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the present case-control study, we found no evidence of an association between the G-2548A variant of the leptin gene and BD among Turks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate serum leptin level to explain the mechanisms behind the lack of association between leptin G2548A gene polymorphism and BD </plain></SENT>
