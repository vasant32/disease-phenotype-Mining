<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective preliminary clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine eyes of five patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> that was resistant to conventional therapy received repeated IVTA injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient was examined monthly, and IVTA was given when the TA particles that remained in the vitreous were judged to be gone before the next visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Repeated IVTA completely prevented the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in eight eyes, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> that had an attack experienced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> when the TA particles disappeared quicker than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was possible to stop systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> within 1 year after IVTA in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that repeated IVTA will prevent the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease with frequent ocular attacks that is resistant to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
