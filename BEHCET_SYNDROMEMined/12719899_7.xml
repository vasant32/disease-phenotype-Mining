<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1997 to 2000, 17 BD and 50 CD cases were examined by EC examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EC was performed with a 13-F balloon catheter via transnasal entubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mucosal and mural changes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test to determine the relation between duration of BD and severity of the EC findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>P &lt;/= 0.05 was considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 12 (70.58%) of 17 BD cases, EC demonstrated intestinal pathologic findings such as ulcerations, fold thickening, granular pattern, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudopolyp</z:e> formation, and bowel wall thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistical correlation between the severity of EC findings and the duration of BD was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EC should be the radiologic method to evaluate the intestinal pathology in symptomatic BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main EC finding in BD was ulceration mostly in the aphthous form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EC findings in BD, even in longstanding cases, are usually mild when compared with those seen in CD </plain></SENT>
