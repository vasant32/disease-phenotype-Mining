<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study the effect of smoking on clinical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were investigated in patients having GST-M1 and/or -T1 null polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-seven patients meeting International Study Group Criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (63 male, 34 female) and 172 healthy controls (94 male, 78 female) were included into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GST-M1 and -T1 polymorphisms were investigated using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Frequency of GSTM1- and/or GSTT1-null polymorphisms were comparable between the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet and the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Smoking patients with GSTM1 null-polymorphism have decreased risk of developing papulopustuler lesions (OR=0.227 [0.063-0.818], χ2=5.463, p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-smoking patients with GSTM1 null-polymorphism has increased risk for having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (OR=5.988 [0.845-43.478]) but smoking patients with GSTM1 null-polymorphism have decreased risk (OR=0.741 [0.593-0.926]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GSTT1 null-polymorphism is associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> (χ2=6.273, p=0.012, OR=2.740 [1.224-6.135]); smoking further increases the risk (χ2=7.840, OR=3.333 [1.412-7.874], p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GSTM1 null-polymorphism seemed to effect development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005310'>large vessel vasculitis</z:hpo> (OR=1.158 [0.981-1.367], χ2=4.760, p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Male smoker <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients even have more risk (OR=1.250 [0.971-1.610]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be influenced by smoking, and this effect can be augmented in patients carrying GST gene polymorphism, which code enzymes crucial for the detoxification of chemicals </plain></SENT>
