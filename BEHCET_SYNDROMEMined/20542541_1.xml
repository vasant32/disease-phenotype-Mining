<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the plasma levels of activated thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (aTAFI) and thrombomodulin (TM) in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) and their relationship with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma aTAFI and TM levels were measured by ELISA in 89 patients with BD (18 having <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>) and in 86 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the BD group had significantly lower levels of aTAFI (13.49+/-8.88 microg/ml vs. 26.76+/-11.57 microg/ml, p&lt;0.0001) and significantly higher levels of TM (3.26+/-1.85 ng/ml vs. 2.6+/-0.69 ng/ml, p=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither aTAFI, nor TM levels differed significantly between BD patients with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite a tendency to positive correlation (r=0.37, p=0.0004) between plasma levels of aTAFI and TM in healthy controls, there was a tendency for negative correlation (r=-0.51, p&lt;0.0001) between these two parameters in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The plasma aTAFI and TM levels do not seem to be related with the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> observed in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma TM levels in BD may simply reflect endothelial cell activation and dysfunction </plain></SENT>
