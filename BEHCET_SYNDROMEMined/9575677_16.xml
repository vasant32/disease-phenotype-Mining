<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenesis of the disease is still unknown, most studies have proposed that immunologic factors may play a major role in its development in genetically predisposed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-one Turkish patients with BD, diagnosed according to the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease criteria, were studied and compared with 600 healthy controls to determine not only frequencies of HLA-A, B, and DR antigens but also whether BD shows any distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, three-point linkage disequilibrium and relative risk (RR) values were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the HLA-A, B, and DR antigens examined, only B5 (51) was significantly increased in the patient group (X2 = 55.4; p &lt; 0.05; RR = 6.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DR7 was significantly decreased in the patient group (X2 = 6.9; p &gt; 0.05; RR = 0.31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA haplotype B5-DR5 was found to be in negative LD in the control group, but <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients showed a strong positive LD between these two antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA haplotypes A2-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>, B5-DR2, and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>-DR4 showed negative LD in the patients; A1-B5 and B5-DR5 had positive LD in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HLA haplotype A2-B5-DR5 was found to be more frequent than expected in both patients and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A2-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>-DR4 showed a negative LD in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The strong LD patterns between HLA-B and DR antigens in BD suggest that the susceptibility gene to BD could reside between the these two antigens </plain></SENT>
