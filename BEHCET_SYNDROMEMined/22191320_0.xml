<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> rarely occurs as clinic manifestation in as little as 1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transverse colon is the most infrequent site of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We presented a patient diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> who underwent both surgical and conversative treatment due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulcerations</z:e> on oral mucosa and genitals and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical symptoms and the International Criteria developed in 1990 Behcet's disease was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the next few days the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, diarrheic syndrome and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011458'>abdominal symptoms</z:hpo> due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of the transverse colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An emergent laparotomy was undertaken involving resection of a perforated segment of the colon, and bipolar colostomy on the left side of abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following the surgery the patient was treated except for antibiotics with three successive pulse doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (500 mg/daily) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment was continued by gradual decrease in the close of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> (perorally) and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> first with monthly doses (5 monthly pulse doses of 15 mg/kg cyclophosphoamide), and then with 3-month doses (totally 6 doses) up to totally 12 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The therapy with pulse doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> combined with pulse doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was very effective in the reported case with the complex clinical manifestations leading to resolution of gastrointenstinal, ocular and orogenital lesions </plain></SENT>
