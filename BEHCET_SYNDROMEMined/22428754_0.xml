<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased level of MMP-9 and a decreased level of MMP-2 have been observed in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to analyze the relationship between MMP-2, -9, -12 and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) promoter polymorphisms in developing BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of MMP-2 and -9 was also evaluated in the skin of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MMPs and TIMP-2 polymorphisms were confirmed by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 251 BD and 312 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous expression of MMP-2 and -9 in 17 BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN) or EN-like lesion was compared with 14 patients with idiopathic EN by immunohistochemical stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of MMP-2-1575*G/*G and MMP-2-735*C/*C genotypes was shown to be lower in BD, whereas MMP-9-1562*C/*C was significantly higher in BD compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of common haplotype MMP-2-1575*G -735*C was significantly lower in BD patients than in controls (P = 0.0046, permutation P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between BD and controls in the allele and genotype frequencies of MMP-12-82A&gt;G or TIMP-2-418G&gt;C polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tissue expression of MMP-2, shown by immunohistochemistry, was significantly lower in BD compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly higher in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MMP-2 and -9 could each modulate the development of BD in opposite directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major genotypes of the MMP-2-1575*G/*G and MMP-2-735*C/*C and the common MMP-2-1575*G -735*C haplotype may provide some protection against development of BD, while MMP-9-1562*C/*C may promote the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reciprocal expression of MMP-2 and -9 in the skin tissue of BD was also confirmed </plain></SENT>
