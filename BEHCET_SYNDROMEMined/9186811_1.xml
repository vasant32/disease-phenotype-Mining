<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the activation of neutrophils has been demonstrated in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, nobody analyzes the clinical activity of the disease by means of the rheological measure of neutrophils activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a micropore (pore diameter 5 microns) filtration technique, we measured the filtration time of peripheral blood neutrophils, as a rheological measure of their activity, in order to determine the clinical activity of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 14 healthy control individuals were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and signs exhibited in the patients led us to distinguish the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease into inactive and active cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter were further differentiated into cases with absent symptoms and with present symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil filtration times were 11.5 +/- 4.8 s in the active cases with present symptoms, which were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) larger than those (7.4 +/- 1.9 s) in the active cases with absent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter filtration times were further significantly (P &lt; 0.001) larger than values (3.7 +/- 1.3 s) in the inactive cases and also those (4.8 +/- 1.2 s) in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, increases in the filtration time obtained immediately after the exposure of cells to the chemotactic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> formyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32648">methionyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-phenylalanine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">FMLP</z:chebi>: 10 nM) were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) larger in the active cases with present symptoms than those in the active cases with absent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter were also larger, but not significantly, than those in the inactive cases, and were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) larger than those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present results demonstrate that the micropore filtration method reflects well the rheological activity of neutrophils as well as the clinical status of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This method is much better than the measurement of O2 production to differentiate between active cases with absent symptoms and inactive patients or even control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is more sensitive and useful than laboratory data like the CRP value or the number of peripheral blood neutrophils </plain></SENT>
