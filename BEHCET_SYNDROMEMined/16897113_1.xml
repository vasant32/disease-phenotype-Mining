<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High serum levels of TNF-alpha were repeatedly reported in patients with active BD and anti-TNF agents are effective in its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of TNF-alpha in BD is still unknown and conflicting results regarding TNF-alpha overproduction by peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) from patients with BD were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to compare stimulated production of TNF-alpha by PBM of BD patients with that of healthy volunteers (HV) and to examine correlations between the ability of PBM to produce TNF-alpha and organ/system involvement in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with BD (mean age 38.4+/-12.4 years, 12 males) gave informed consent and completed the European BD Current Activity Form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PBM were separated and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) overnight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha levels in the supernatants were assayed by ELISA and values were expressed in terms of cell protein contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group included 15 HV (mean age 34.2+/-9.9 years, seven males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean production of TNF-alpha/cell protein (ng/mg) and in-group dispersion were similar in both groups (p=0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup analysis, TNF-alpha production by PBM in BD patients who reported "bad" or "very bad" global well-being over the last month (n=4) was higher compared to other patients with better self-rating (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PBM of BD patients in the present study did not overproduce TNF-alpha upon stimulation with LPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, BD patients with a higher TNF-alpha-producing capacity had worse sense of well-being </plain></SENT>
