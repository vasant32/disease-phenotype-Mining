<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such effects were not significantly different at the six concentrations of cells or the four times in culture studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences from controls were also seen with cells from clinically controlled, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients; the cells responded better than controls at low cell concentrations and early times in culture, the reverse occurring at higher concentrations and later times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pattern of response suggests the presence of a higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proportion of responsive cells in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that not only is a still wider range of culture conditions required to assess fully the differences in lymphocyte function related to disease activity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment in JCA or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's, but also that the use of a narrow set of 'optimized' conditions may be misleading </plain></SENT>
