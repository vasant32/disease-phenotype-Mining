<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extraocular complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, vascular occlusive disorders, mucocutaneous lesions, and central-<z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>-system disease may lead to morbidity and even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We designed a prospective study in newly diagnosed patients without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eye disease</z:e> to assess whether prevention of eye involvement and extraocular manifestations, and preservation of visual acuity are possible with combination treatments with and without interferon alfa-2b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 3 million units interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously every other day for the first 6 months plus 1.5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> orally daily and 1.2 million units <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> intramuscularly every 3 weeks (n=67), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> alone (n=68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was visual-acuity loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was by intention to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Significantly fewer patients who were treated with interferon had eye involvement than did patients who did not receive interferon (eight vs 27, relative risk 0.21 [95% CI 0.09-0.50], p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ocular attack rate was 0.2 (SD 0.62) per year with interferon therapy and 1.02 (1.13) without interferon therapy (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visual-acuity loss was significantly lower among patients treated with interferon than in those without interferon (two vs 13, relative risk 0.13 [95% CI 0.03-0.60], p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> episodes, vascular events, and mucocutaneous lesions were also less frequent in patients treated with interferon than in those not receiving interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious side-effects were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Therapy with interferon alfa-2b, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> seems to be an effective regimen in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease for the prevention of recurrent eye attacks and extraocular complications, and for the protection of vision </plain></SENT>
