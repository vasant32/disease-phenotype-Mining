<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise pathologic mechanism of parenchymal NBD lesions has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated lesion characteristics and probable venous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in parenchymal NBD by using SWI, and we compared the imaging results with conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging by using a 1.5T scanner in 23 patients with a definitive diagnosis of parenchymal NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the proportion of lesion detection and the performance of hemorrhagic detection with the T2 FSE, T2*GE, and SWI magnitude, and SWI mIP by using the χ(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of lesion detection with both SWI magnitude and SWI MinMIP was significantly larger than that with T2*GE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of lesion detection among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other pairs of methods were not significantly different according to the corresponding P value (χ(2) = 17.4929, df = 3, P = .0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proportions of hypointense hemorrhagic lesions with T2 FSE and T2*GE were not significantly different, and likewise for the proportions of hypointense hemorrhagic lesions with SWI magnitude and SWI mIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the proportions of hypointense hemorrhagic lesions with SWI magnitude and SWI mIP were significantly larger than that with T2 FSE and T2*GE (χ(2) = 108.5396, df = 3, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most of the lesions in parenchymal NBD were found to be hemorrhagic with SWI, supporting the proposed venous theory in pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, compared with T2 FSE and T2*GE sequences, SWI was more successful in the determination of widespread involvement of the disease, particularly in nonchronic cases </plain></SENT>
