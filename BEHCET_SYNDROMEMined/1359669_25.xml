<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In serological typing, the frequency of HLA-B51 was significantly increased in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In PCR genotyping, there was a significant increase in the HLA-DRB1*0802, DQA1*0301 and DQB1*0303 alleles, whereas the frequencies of DRB1*1502, DQA1*0103, DQA1*0101, DQB1*0601 and DQB1*0501 showed a significant decrease in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in any HLA-DPB1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among them, B51 was found to be a genetic marker most strongly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (p less than 0.00005, chi 2 = 46.47, pc[corrected p] less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative associations of class II alleles with the disease can be explained by linkage disequilibrium with B51, and do not reach statistical significance by the corrected p-value test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In NcoI RFLP typing in the TNF beta gene, 250 kb centromeric of the HLA-B gene, the frequency of a 5.5 kb fragment was considerably decreased in the patients when compared to the controls, although the decrease was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
