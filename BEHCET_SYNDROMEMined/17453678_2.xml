<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) is characterized with remissions and exacerbations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, to date, there is no study to investigate a possible association of disease activity (active versus inactive disease period) with cardiovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with BD were evaluated in both active and in inactive disease period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the control group 45 healthy volunteers, age and sex matched, were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects with at least a 15-day lesion-free period were regarded in inactive disease period, and subjects with any oral, skin, and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0744369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital lesion</z:e> was regarded as in active disease period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each subject coronary diastolic peak flow velocities (DPFV) were measured at baseline and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> infusion (0.84 mg/kg over 6 minutes) using an Acuson Sequoia C256 echocardiography system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coronary flow reserve (CFR) was defined as the ratio of hyperemic to baseline DPFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CFR values were significantly lower in BD patients compared to the controls (2.57+/-0.50 versus 2.87+/-0.53, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In active disease period, basal DPFV (24.6+/-7.5 versus 27.3+/-6.6, P = 0.019) was significantly higher than in the inactive disease period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the active disease period hyperemic DPFV (61.7+/-14.9 versus 56.8+/-16.7, P = 0.015) values decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the active disease period CFR significantly decreased from 2.57+/-0.50 to 2.09+/-0.46, P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only independent predictor of CFR within the active disease period was the disease duration (beta = -0.384, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Within the active disease period, coronary microvascular function is more prominently impaired in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BD patients are possibly more vulnerable to cardiovascular manifestations when they are in an active disease period </plain></SENT>
