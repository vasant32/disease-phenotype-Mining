<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the long term clinical course and prognosis of subclinical ('silent') neurological involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included patients with BD who did not have any neurological complaints other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, dizziness or other non-specific complaints, that showed abnormal neurological findings (Silent Group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared these patients with the patients with overt parenchymal neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (Overt Group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases with at least 8 years of follow-up were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 22 patients in the Silent Group (15M, 7F), with a mean follow-up of 12.8 +/- 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was abnormal in 8 of 21 patients, while neuropsychological testing revealed mild abnormalities in 15 of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow up period, 3 patients of the Silent Group had 4 overt neurological attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the last visit, 21 patients were independent, while one that had previously developed overt neurological attack was deceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Overt Group consisted of 51 patients (45M, 6F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the Overt Group the ratio of males was higher, nearing a marginal significance (p = 0.051); whereas age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD, and frequency of other organ manifestations of BD were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the Overt Group at the final visit, 19 patients were independent (37%), while the remaining were either dependent to others, or deceased, which was significantly higher when compared to the Silent Group(p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Silent neurological involvement in BD seems to represent a milder form of the disease, since the mortality and disability rate in this group is significantly low </plain></SENT>
