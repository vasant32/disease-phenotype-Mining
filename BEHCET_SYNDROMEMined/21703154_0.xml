<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the thrombotic tendency of BD are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In recent researches, it is reported that procoagulant mutations might play a role in thrombotic process in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the frequency of activated protein C resistance (APCR) in our BD patients and to investigate the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and APCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study included 116 patients with BD who fulfilled the International Study Group criteria and 70 healthy individuals as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APCR levels were measured by the clotting method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>APCR levels were 129.63 ± 39.70 and 152.26 ± 22.62 in BD patients and control group, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>APCR was found in 47.4% and 8.6% of BD patients and control group, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference regarding APCR levels between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (46.4% vs. 48.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found the frequency of APCR to be increased in BD patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lack of association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and APCR in our series of BD patients suggests that some factors like endothelial abnormalities other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD </plain></SENT>
