<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, there have been no studies focusing on the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy in intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to investigate clinical outcomes and predictors of clinical relapse in intestinal BD patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with intestinal BD who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy in a single tertiary academic medical center between March 1986 and October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probabilities of clinical relapse after remission were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of clinical relapse were identified by univariate analysis using the log-rank test and by multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 272 patients with intestinal BD, 67 (24.6%) received their first course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine (58.2%) of the 67 patients constantly received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi> for maintaining medically or surgically induced remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative relapse rates at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years after remission were 5.8%, 28.7%, 43.7%, and 51.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, a younger age (&lt;25 years) at diagnosis and a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level (&lt;11 g/dL) were independent predictive factors for relapse in intestinal BD patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi> maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">Thiopurine</z:chebi> therapy showed a relatively good effect for maintenance of remission in intestinal BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a younger age at diagnosis and a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level were associated with a poor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, necessitating early adoption of effective alternative therapeutic options in these risk groups </plain></SENT>
