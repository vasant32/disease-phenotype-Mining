<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 89 female SLE and 49 male BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven age and sex matched healthy volunteers served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were subjected to full clinical examination, laboratory investigations and assessment of disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of Gas6 and sAxl were quantified using ELISA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The level of Gas6 and Axl were significantly altered in the SLE patients (p &lt; 0.001) and in the BD patients (p 0.001 and 0.04 respectively) compared to those of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SLE, the Gas6 was remarkably lower in those with class 1 lupus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and in those with neuropsychiatric manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the BD patients, the level of Axl was significantly increased in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of lymphocytes significantly negatively correlated with the gas6 and Axl levels significantly correlated with the number of neutrophils and negatively with the lymphocytic count in the BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The plasma concentrations of Gas6 and Axl were significantly altered in SLE and BD patients, suggesting that the Axl receptor shedding is an active process affected by and influences Gas6-mediated Axl-signaling in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Special attention is required in SLE patients with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> and neuropsychiatric manifestations and BD patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relation with lymphocytes and neutrophils in BD throws light on the role of gas6 and Axl on their known resistance to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of BD remain to be clarified, the role of the apoptotic process seems critical throughout the disease </plain></SENT>
