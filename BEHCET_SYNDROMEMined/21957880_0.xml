<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the G894T and 4b/a polymorphisms of eNOS and BD using: (i) the allele contrast, (ii) the recessive model, (iii) the dominant model and (iv) the additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of eight studies, which included 841 cases and 866 controls, were included in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the G894T polymorphism revealed no association with BD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects or in Turkish and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, one Tunisian study of the T allele showed a significant association with BD (OR = 0.707, 95% CI = 0.510-0.980, P = 0.038), but the OR of the T allele among Tunisians was lower, whereas it was higher in Europeans (OR = 2.129, 95% CI = 1.407-3.220, P = 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis showed no association between BD and the 4b/a polymorphism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratification by ethnicity indicated no significant association between the a allele of the 4b/a polymorphism and BD in Turkish and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the eNOS G894T and the 4b/a polymorphisms are not associated with BD in the Turkish and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the G894T and the 4b/a polymorphisms may not confer susceptibility to BD in the Turkish and Asian populations </plain></SENT>
