<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific vessel-based papulopustular lesions as well as nonspecific follicular lesions may be seen in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some authors suggest that papulopustular lesions should be considered a positive criterion only if they exhibit a vessel-based neutrophilic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To determine whether specific vessel-based papulopustular lesions can be differentiated clinically from nonspecific follicular lesions in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three papulopustular lesions in 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were initially examined clinically by two dermatologists blind to each other's diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsies taken from these lesions were examined by a pathologist unaware of the patient data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> or perivascular infiltration was observed in 10 lesions, perifollicular and perivascular infiltration was noted in nine lesions, and perifollicular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was seen in four biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the lesions interpreted clinically as specific papulopustular lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had predominantly perivascular infiltration or leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>; however, three papulopustular lesions evaluated by both observers as specific papulopustular lesions had only perifollicular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and one lesion diagnosed clinically as a nonspecific follicular eruption revealed perivascular neutrophilic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interobserver variance was noted in three papulopustular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical examination may not be sufficient to predict the dermatopathologic pattern in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Papulopustular lesions with no specific clinical and histopathologic features may create problems in the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
