<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the value of color Doppler imaging (CDI) of orbital vasculature in the assessment of ocular involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) without clinical ophthalmologic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CDI of the orbital vessels were performed on 26 eyes of 13 patients who were diagnosed as having BD with ocular involvement (group 1), 65 eyes of 33 patients who had BD without ocular involvement (group 2) and 40 eyes of 20 healthy volunteers (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) blood flow velocities and resistivity index (RI) measurements were obtained for the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean velocity of the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein (CRV) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, PSV and EDVs were significantly lower and RIs were significantly higher in group 2 than in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, only the EDVs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> were significantly lower than in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the CRA, PSV and EDVs were significantly lower, and RIs were significantly higher in both BD groups than those in group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When group 1 and group 2 were compared, the differences between PSV, EDV and RI measurements for the CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> were statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in blood flow velocity of the CRV between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Major hemodynamic changes were observed in the ophthalmic vasculature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with or without ocular involvement by CDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CDI may detect ocular blood flow alterations before initial clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
