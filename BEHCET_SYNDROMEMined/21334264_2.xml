<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytokine levels were significantly higher in the three disease groups than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with similar disease activity, levels of IL-15 and IFN-γ were significantly higher in BD patients than in VKH and HLA-B27-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression identified a significant negative correlation between BD and high levels of IL-10 and a significant positive correlation between VKH disease and high levels of IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proinflammatory cytokines versus IL-10 ratios were significantly higher in BD compared with other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that both T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells are involved in endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> immunopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD is characterized by extensive Th1 polarization, severe proinflammatory conditions and a low immunosuppressive status </plain></SENT>
