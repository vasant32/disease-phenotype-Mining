<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the precise etiology is unclear, high prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 predisposition and predominantly involved T-helper type 1 cells (Th1)-type proinflammatory cytokines and extrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Streptococcal infection</z:e> suggest a substantial association with an immunogenetic basis and strengthens the hypothesis that IL-12, a potent inducer of Th-1 immune reaction, is a putative candidate in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These clinicopathological findings led us to examine interleukin 12 p40 (IL-12B) promoter polymorphism, for which the 4-base pair (bp) heterozygous insertion has been shown to affect the gene transcription and subsequent protein production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed IL-12B promoter genotypes in 194 Japanese subjects (92 with ABD and 102 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls) by PCR-based restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the insertion heterozygosity was significantly higher in patients than in controls (49/92, 53.3% vs 39/102, 38.2%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing these with HLA haplotype data, this trend was more significant in HLA-B51-negative patients (29/42, 69.0% vs 20/50, 40.0%; P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and ELISA, stimulation with Streptococcal antigens specifically increased expression of IL-12 p40 mRNA and protein, in conjunction with IL-12 p70 induction, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heterozygous patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide evidence for anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> host response toward Th1-immunity mediated by IL-12 in patients with ABD, and the possible insight into the genetic susceptibility that is independent of HLA background </plain></SENT>
