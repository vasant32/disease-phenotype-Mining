<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the fetal safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective observational comparative cohort study regarding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> exposure during pregnancy including contacts to 2 Teratology Information Services in Israel from 1994 through 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 238 colchicine-exposed pregnancies (97.0% first trimester) and 964 pregnancies with nonteratogenic exposure were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment indications were: familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (87.3%), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (7.5%), or other (5.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of major congenital anomalies was comparable between the groups (10/221 [4.5%] vs 35/908 [3.9%]; P = .648) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no cytogenetic anomalies in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median gestational age at delivery was earlier (39 [38-40] vs 40 [38-41] weeks; P &lt; .001), the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> was higher (32/214 [15.0%] vs 51/867 [5.9%]; P &lt; .001), and the median birthweight was lower (3000 [2688-3300] vs 3300 [2900-3600] g; P &lt; .001) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> does not appear to be a major human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50905">teratogen</z:chebi>, and, probably, has no cytogenetic effect </plain></SENT>
