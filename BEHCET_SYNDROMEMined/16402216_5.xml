<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with BD without arterial involvement (male/female 21/13; mean age 34.6+/-8.5 years) were individually matched to control subjects on the basis of age (within 2 years) and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or cerebrovascular disease, and patients on long-term steroids (i.e., &gt;6 months) were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values of the right carotid arteries were 0.81+/-0.17 mm for patients with BD, and 0.54+/-0.13 mm for healthy controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values of the left carotid arteries were 0.82+/-0.16 mm for patients with BD, and 0.55+/-0.12 mm for healthy controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques was higher among the patients than the controls [prevalence of plaques were 17.6% (6/34) in BD patients and 0% in healthy controls, P&lt;0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data indicate morphologic evidence of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
