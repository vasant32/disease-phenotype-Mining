<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A chart review was done to determine the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in BS among 4000 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from 14 BS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> were compared with data obtained from 718 patients with BS without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> presented with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> or significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was 8.1 yr (range 3-15 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was 3.4 yr (range 1-11 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven out of 14 patients were alive at the time of the evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peripheral and pulmonary arterial involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>Amyloidosis</z:hpo> in BS is rare and has a 50% mortality rate at 3.4 yr (range 1-11 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripheral and pulmonary arterial involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> seem to be the strongest predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in BS </plain></SENT>
