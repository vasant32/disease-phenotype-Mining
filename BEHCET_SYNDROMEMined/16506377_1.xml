<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper is to establish surgical criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: We reviewed the medical records of 8 consecutive Japanese patients who were diagnosed with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's at Tsukuba University Hospital between 1976 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Records were examined for medical treatment including dose of steroids, and surgical treatment including length of resected intestine, incidence of recurrence, and the form and site of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elective surgery was performed in cases where the preoperative steroid administration could not be reduced to under 40mg/day, once steroids exceeded 40mg/day to control symptoms and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases with emergency operations (perforated cases), the preoperative doses of steroids were not so high (0, 0, 10, 20mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the post-surgical steroid dose was reduced under 20mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases showed recurrence after surgery within 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases also had an increase in steroid dosage at the time of recurrence, but have been controlled medically so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgery should be strongly considered when the steroid dose exceeds 40mg/day </plain></SENT>
