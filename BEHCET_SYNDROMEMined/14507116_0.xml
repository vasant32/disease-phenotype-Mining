<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Protein Z is a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin-K</z:chebi>-dependent plasma protein that serves as a cofactor for the inhibition of factor Xa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the precise physiologic function of protein Z is still unknown, abnormal plasma protein Z concentrations have been associated with a number of thrombotic <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is the evidence of universal activation of the hemostatic system in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), which represents a hypercoagulable/prothrombotic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Circulating protein Z levels in patients with BD were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma protein Z concentrations were assayed in 24 patients with BD (male/female: 13/11, mean age 35.4 years) and in 24 healthy controls (males/females: 14/10, mean age 59.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease duration was 10.6 years (range, 1-30 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the subjects in either group had received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> within 3 weeks before the study, and none of them had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> were also excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma concentrations of protein Z were 141 ng/mL (range, 56.8-257) in healthy controls and 107.8 ng/mL (range, 21.2-202) in BD patients (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between the disease duration and protein Z levels in the study group (p&lt;0.05, r=0.448) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alterations of protein Z concentrations could complicate the pathobiology of the prothrombotic state of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the tendency of increment in the protein Z with the passage of time may reflect the diminution of the disease activity </plain></SENT>
