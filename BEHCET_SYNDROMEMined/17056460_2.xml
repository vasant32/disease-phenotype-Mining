<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> and 10 healthy controls were prospectively recruited in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effector-related surface markers (CD27, CD62L, CD11b, HLA-DR, CD94, NKG2D), chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR3, CCR4, CCR5), and intracellular perforin of circulating CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells were determined by flow cytometric analysis before and after two months' treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NK-like cytotoxicity of ex vivo CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells against K562 was measured by standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expression levels of effector-related molecules on CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells normalized after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of CXCR1 and CCR5 were down-regulated on CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amounts of preformed intracellular perforin of CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells were reduced to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the NK-like cytolytic capacities of CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells were decreased after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the combined Cs/Pd treatments in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> may downregulate the NK-like effector functions of CD8(bright)CD56+ T cells </plain></SENT>
