<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenetic factor and a marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VEGF could contribute to the pathological events in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEGF could also be an important factor in the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether there is correlation between intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the carotid arteries and serum VEGF levels in BD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with BD (male/female: 15/6, mean age: 35.8 +/- 8.6 years) were individually matched to control subjects on the basis of age (within 3 years) and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the subjects was measured by high-resolution B-mode US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values of common carotid arteries were 0.86 +/- 0.18 mm for patients with BD, and 0.57 +/- 0.14 mm for healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean VEGF levels were 130.41 +/- 58.28 pg/ml for patients with BD and 82.69 +/- 25.03 pg/ml for healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between VEGF levels in the control group and in the BD group, but there was a significant correlation between VEGF levels and mean carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in the whole group (r = 0.317, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, elevation of VEGF appears as a feature of the inflammatory reaction during the course of BD, not a direct determinant of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the significant correlation between carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and serum VEGF levels in the whole group suggests that association between VEGF levels and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> warrants further investigation with larger sample sizes </plain></SENT>
