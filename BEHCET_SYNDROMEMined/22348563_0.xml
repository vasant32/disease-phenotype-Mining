<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the etiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) is still unknown, neutrophils are implicated in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growth-related oncogene-α (GRO-α) is a potent chemoattractant and activator for neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of GRO-α in the pathogenesis of BD, we investigated serum GRO-α levels in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sera from patients with BD (n=57) and control subjects (n=26) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of GRO-α were compared with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with BD had significantly elevated serum GRO-α levels compared with healthy controls (121.7±79.2pg/ml vs. 75.9±20.6pg/ml, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concerning the subgroups of BD, serum GRO-α levels in active patients with BD (n=35) were significantly higher than in inactive patients with BD (n=22; 139.0±92.8 pg/ml vs. 94.3±36.2pg/ml, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, as seen in previous studies, serum interleukin-8 levels in patients with BD (52.4±81.8pg/ml) were significantly higher than in controls (13.9±19.7pg/ml, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhanced GRO-α levels correlated with clinical symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that serum levels of GRO-α are elevated in patients with active stage BD, suggesting that GRO-α may serve as a reliable marker for disease activity of BD </plain></SENT>
