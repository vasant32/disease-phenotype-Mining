<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous GWAS studies from Turkey suggested a potential risk locus at CCR1/CCR3 for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this locus did not reach the GWAS significance threshold and has not yet been examined in other ethnic populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to explore whether this locus was associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Chinese Han and the functional role of the identified variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A two-stage association study was performed in 653 patients and 1,685 controls using the iPLEX system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR was performed to examine the expression level of CCR1 and CCR3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis was used to construct the haplotype block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate the independence of multiple associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First stage analysis showed that ten SNPs, located in 3'UTR, 5'UTR in CCR1 or 5'UTR in CCR3, were significantly associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (P(c) = 0.018 to 1.3 × 10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The associations of six SNPs within this locus are independent after control for the genetic effect of rs17282391 using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis identified three associated haplotypes: H3 (GTGAC), H6 (CCATTA) and H9 (CGA) (P(c) = 0.04 to 7.79 × 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs rs13084057, rs13092160 and rs13075270 showed consistent association in replication and combining studies (replication P(c) = 5.31 × 10(-5) to 1.44 × 10(-5); combining P(c) = 2.76 × 10(-7) to 6.50 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, eQTLs database reveals that SNP rs13092160 is eQTLs SNP, suggesting that this SNP is likely to be functional SNP that directly affects gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expression of CCR1 and CCR3 was increased in individuals with the CT genotype of rs13092160 (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of CCR1 and CCR3 between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly indicate CCR1/CCR3 as a novel locus underlying <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
