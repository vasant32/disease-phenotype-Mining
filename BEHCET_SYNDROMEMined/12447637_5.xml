<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Synovial MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels were measured by two-step sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between study and control groups regarding erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, MMP-1 and TIMP-1 values </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The synovial TIMP-1 levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> were higher than those of patients with the other three diseases, among which the difference was not statistically significant, and the difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> and the others was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the detection of similar levels of synovial MMP-1 in patients with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, we conclude that the absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> in patients with familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be explained by MMP-1 being a marker of cytokine-driven <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, or by the short-lived and transient nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
