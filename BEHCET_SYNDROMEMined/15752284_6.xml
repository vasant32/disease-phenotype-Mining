<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the balance between oxidant and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> systems in these patients, we measured erythrocyte lysate CuZn <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (CuZn SOD) activity, plasma sulfhydryl (SH) values and total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also determined levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and compared them with those of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found plasma nitrotyrosine levels of BD patients to be increased, indicating that nitrosative stress may occur in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and CRP levels in BD patients were found to be significantly higher than those in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, plasma SH levels were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in the other measured parameters of the patient group compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest the possible involvement of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) together with reactive oxygen substances (ROS) in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
