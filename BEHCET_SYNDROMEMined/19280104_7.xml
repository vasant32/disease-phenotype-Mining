<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical, neuroradiological findings and follow-up data were compared between patients with BD and patients with other etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 36 patients with CVT and BD, and 32 patients with CVT related to other etiological causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD patients were younger (median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 26 vs. 39 years; P &lt; 0.001), and there was a male preponderance (28 males, 8 females) as compared to the non-BD group (10 males, 22 females; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the BD group 94% of the patients presented with symptoms of isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in 63% of the patients with other causes and in 6% of the patients with BD (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At admission 97% of the patients in the BD group and 41% of the patients in the non-BD group had a modified Rankin score of 0-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Outcome was good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients with BD and in 91% of patients with other causes </plain></SENT>
