<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted this study to determine if the expression level of serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) can be used as a biological marker to assess disease activity in intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 88 patients with intestinal BD were enrolled prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed their clinical disease activities using the disease activity index for intestinal BD (DAIBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time that the DAIBD was assessed, serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as well as levels of TREM-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α (TNF-α) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean ESR and mean levels of sTREM-1, CRP, and TNF-α in patients with intestinal BD were significantly higher than those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of sTREM-1 were the most highly correlated with disease activity (r = 0.762 for the DAIBD score), followed by CRP levels (r = 0.383 for the DAIBD score) and ESR (r = 0.236 for the DAIBD score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, serum levels of TNF-α level were not correlated with disease activity (r = -0.017 for the DAIBD score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum sTREM-1 levels were more highly correlated with disease activity than were CRP levels or ESR in patients with intestinal BD, suggesting that serum sTREM-1 level could be a potential marker for the assessment of disease activity of intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
