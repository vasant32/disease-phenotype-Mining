<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: High resolution (four-digit) allele genotyping was used to determine the association of the HLA-A and -B alleles with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed our results for the association of these alleles with the individual clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 389 Japanese BD patients and 254 healthy controls in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the HLA-A, -B alleles was performed by the PCR-SSOP-Luminex method and the phenotype frequencies of the HLA-A, and -B alleles were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Some HLA-A and -B alleles were significantly associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When we recalculated the phenotype frequencies for the HLA-B*51-negative subjects to exclude the effects of the linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-B*51 allele, HLA-A*2601 was most strongly associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed a significant association between several clinical features and some alleles, including HLA-A*2602 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significant increase of HLA-A* 26 in the BD patients without HLA-B*51 suggests that this allele itself might be one of the primary susceptibility genes involved in the development of BD independently of HLA-B*51 </plain></SENT>
