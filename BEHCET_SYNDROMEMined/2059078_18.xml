<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 and B52 were present in 24/38 (63%) and 8/38 (21%), respectively, of the patients compared with 13/151 (9%) of the control group for both cases, a relative risk of 18.2 and 2.8 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The syndrome was found in six of the 34 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety five per cent of the affected family members were either B51 or B52 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 14 families (79%) chosen for study contained a close relative of the proband who had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the relatives with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, except for one, were B51 or B52 carriers </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that (a) HLA-B51 and HLA-B52 are primarily associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease of Israeli patients; (b) the familial occurrence of this syndrome is high and occurs predominantly in the B5 positive group; (c) recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> may be the first symptom of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, appearing early in life; HLA analysis can provide the clue for a correct diagnosis; (d) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> recurrence is common among members of a family containing a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
