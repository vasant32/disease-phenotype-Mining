<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the distribution of the different HLA-B51* alleles among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and ethnically matched healthy controls in a Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serological B51 specificity was increased in BD patients (37.5% versus 15.5% in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the B51-associated alleles, the frequencies of B*5101 (32%) and 5108 (5.5%) were increased in BD patients with respect to the control frequencies (13% and 1.2% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fact that different HLA-B51 subtypes are associated with BD could suggest that common motifs shared by HLA-B51-related alleles are involved in the susceptibility to BD or, in the light of recent studies, that a mutation causing the susceptibility to BD occurred in the B*5101 haplotype, close to HLA-B gene, before the divergence of B*5108 from the B*5101 allele </plain></SENT>
