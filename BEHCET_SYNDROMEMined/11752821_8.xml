<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">Mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (MMF) is a drug resembling their activity but with comparably negligible adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A prospective clinical proof-of-principle study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness and toxicity of MMF in mucocutaneous Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients were to be treated with MMF 2 g/day p.o. for 6 months, in combination with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> 30 mg/day p.o. during the first month of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inefficacy was followed by an increase in MMF dose to 3 g/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy variable was the decrease in the disease activity index (DAI) according to a modified variant of the Iran <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease Dynamic Activity Measure system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study was interrupted due to inefficacy of the compound after the intermediate evaluation of the first 6 patients (aged 37.0 +/- 7.7 years with disease duration of 10.0 +/- 8.9 years) as required by the ethical committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although an improvement of the DAI from 5.2 +/- 3.5 to 1.3 +/- 0.5 was found after the first month of combination treatment, withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> led to quick relapses with a new index increase (3.0 +/- 3.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment was discontinued in 3 patients after 3 months, in 2 patients after 4 months and in another one after 5 months due to deterioration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Introduction of interferon alpha(2a) (3 x 9 million IU 3x/week s.c.) in 3 patients decreased the activity index from 4.0 +/- 1.0 to 0.0 +/- 0.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were detected under MMF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMF (2-3 g/day) is unable to control the signs of mucocutaneous Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
