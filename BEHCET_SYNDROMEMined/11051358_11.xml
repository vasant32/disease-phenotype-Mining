<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Much remains unknown about the pathogenesis of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of these patients are treated with surgical intervention, although it has been recently reported that a number of medical treatments are sometimes effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only few studies, however, have ever been undertaken to analyze the long-term prognosis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the clinical course and the recurrences after initial therapy in patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 20 patients (surgical group, n = 8; nonsurgical group, n = 12) for whom the clinical courses were known for &gt; or = 2 yr (2-23 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The surgical group tended to have higher rates of complications such as ocular and ileal lesions than the nonsurgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the surgical group, 75% of the patients recurred (and were readmitted) within 2 yr, and 37.5% of the patients required reoperation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005214'>intestinal obstruction</z:hpo> because of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> at the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of peripheral CD8+ DR+ lymphocytes in the recurrent group (10.4% +/- 2.5%) was significantly higher than that in the nonrecurrent group (4.3% +/- 1.2%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> involving the ileum and ocular lesions are markers of severity and progression to surgical crisis, and that patients requiring surgery suffer more frequent recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an increased percentage of peripheral CD8+ DR+ lymphocytes may be a risk factor for disease recurrence </plain></SENT>
