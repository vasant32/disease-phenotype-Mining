<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> is a key feature of the disease, which may lead to functional disturbances in highly vascularized organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, cardiac involvement is seldom recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> (SMI) in BD as the clinical presentation of microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambulatory cardiac monitoring (Holter) was used in 36 patients with BD to detect silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>201Thallium myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and radionuclide ventriculography were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients fulfilled International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease criteria and 11 of them had major vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same method was also performed on 38 control subjects for comparison of SMI positivity in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ambulatory cardiac monitoring was performed for 9.2 +/- 0.9 h, mean heart rate was 82 +/- 9 bpm, and no serious rhythm disturbance was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SMI was described in 9 of 36 patients (25%) (median age 38 years, range 30-46) as ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of 3.00 +/- 0.42 mm with a duration of 4.01 +/- 0.9 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One SMI positivity only was recorded in the control group in a 52-year-old man with a stenotic lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight of 9 patients with SMI showed a partially reversible myocardial perfusion defect after exertion, and 7 demonstrated some degree of left ventricular wall motion abnormality by radionuclide ventriculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 7 of 9 patients with SMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 7 of 9 patients with SMI had major vascular involvement, while only 4 of 27 without SMI had major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (p = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SMI incidence is significantly higher in BD compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Impaired endothelial cell function may be the underlying cause in the pathogenesis of BD or of its vascular complications such as SMI </plain></SENT>
