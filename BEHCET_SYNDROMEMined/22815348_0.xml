<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of gene expression regulators involved in immune regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the role of miRNA in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> entities: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vogt Koyanagi Harada syndrome</z:e> (VKH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of five miRNAs was studied in PBMCs, DCs, and CD4(+) T cells from BD patients with active and inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, VKH patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and healthy controls using real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MiR-155 mimics and inhibitor were transfected to DCs to evaluate the effect on DC maturation and cytokine production by these cells and CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting were performed to identify the target gene of miR-155 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only miR-155 expression was significantly decreased in PBMCs and DCs from BD patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and no differences were observed in the miRNA expression in cells from patients with VKH as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of miR-155 in DCs was shown to inhibit the production of IL-6 and IL-1Î², and to promote the expression of IL-10 by these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiR-155 transfected DCs significantly inhibited intracellular IL-17 expression in allogeneic CD4(+) T cells; however, it did not influence the expression of cell surface markers CD80, CD40, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter assays revealed that TAB2 was a target gene of miR-155, which was confirmed by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that miR-155 expression is decreased in active BD but not in VKH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Downregulated miR-155 may be involved in BD pathogenesis by targeting TAB2 </plain></SENT>
