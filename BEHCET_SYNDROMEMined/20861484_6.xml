<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine whether infliximab induces the development of Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects were patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada</z:e> disease, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040561" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular toxoplasmosis</z:e> and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Purified CD4+ T cells were obtained from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, or infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of Foxp3 on CD4+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Foxp3 was expressed in a small percentage of CD4+ T cells (&lt;5%) from healthy subjects and from patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada</z:e> disease, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040561" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular toxoplasmosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Foxp3+ cells among CD4+ T cells was significantly decreased in patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> compared with patients with inactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in the remission stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Foxp3 was expressed at a similar level in CD4+ T cells from healthy donors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-treated patients, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-treated patients, whereas infliximab-treated patients expressed much higher percentages of Foxp3+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a high population of Foxp3+ cells during infliximab treatment did not experience any subsequent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients with a low population of Foxp3+ cells did experience ocular inflammatory episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T cells exposed to infliximab in vitro greatly expressed Foxp3 and produced TGFβ, and the Treg cells significantly suppressed the activation of bystander T cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF-α therapy may be useful for patients with ocular complications of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who have a decreased percentage of peripheral Treg cells </plain></SENT>
