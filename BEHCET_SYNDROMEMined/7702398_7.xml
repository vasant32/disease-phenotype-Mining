<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of antibodies to human fibronectin (anti-Fn) in sera of patients with certain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> and to determine their association with disease activity and the pattern of organ involvement in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to quantify anti-Fn antibodies in serum samples from 65 patients with well characterised SLE, 50 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), 15 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), 15 with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and 36 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An anti-Fn antibody titre greater than mean + 3SD of the healthy control log values after back transformation to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> scale was considered positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity in SLE patients was scored using the British Isles <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> Assessment Group (BILAG) Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), concentrations of anti-dsDNA antibody, soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R), C3, C4, C3 degradation products (C3dg) and immunoglobulin, and antinuclear antibody (ANA) titres were measured in blood samples from SLE patients; neopterin concentration was measured in corresponding urine samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-Fn antibodies were found in 22 of 65 SLE patients (33.8%), seven of 50 with RA (14%), one of 15 with BD (6.6%) and none of the 15 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty SLE patients had active disease and 35 had inactive disease; their median anti-Fn concentrations were 117 u/ml (range 47-450) and 68 u/ml (range 17-334), respectively (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-Fn did not correlate with immunoglobulin concentrations or ANA titres in these sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between SLE patients with disease activity in one major organ system compared with multiple organ involvement, as defined by BILAG (p = 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, patients with musculoskeletal manifestations had consistently greater anti-Fn concentrations compared with patients with other clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between amounts of anti-Fn in SLE sera and ESR (rs = 0.25, p = 0.045), sIL-2R (rs = 0.28, p = 0.024) and urine neopterin (rs = 0.3, p = 0.016) but not with serum anti-dsDNA antibody titres, plasma C3, C3dg or C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However multiple regression analysis showed a low significant correlation only with sIL-2R and BILAG score (p = 0.047 and 0.042, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-Fn antibodies were detected in 34% of SLE patients and in small proportions of RA and BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An association between serum anti-Fn and disease activity in SLE has been identified and most SLE patients with musculoskeletal involvement had increased anti-Fn antibody concentrations </plain></SENT>
