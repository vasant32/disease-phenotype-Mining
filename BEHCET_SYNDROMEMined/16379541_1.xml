<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sandwich hybridization technique was applied in the design of the specific oligonucleotide probes to ensure the specific and accurate results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probe-spotted chip was hybridized with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons including nine suballeles (B*5101-B*5109) of exons 2 and 3 of HLA-B51 gene to determine the HLA-B51 genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were subsequently confirmed by (PCR-SSP) and sequencing and were identical to those from polymerase chain reaction-sequencing specific primers (PCR-SSP) in 27 patients with BD and 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that we successfully developed the oligochip for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s-associated gene HLA-B51, which can effectively and accurately identify the HLA-B51 genotypes </plain></SENT>
