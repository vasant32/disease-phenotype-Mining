<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was carried out in 32 eyes of 24 patients with ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 42 eyes of 21 persons as a healthy age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to detect the hemodynamic changes in ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities (PSV, EDV; cm/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>), resistive and pulsatile indices (RI, PI), and PSV/EDV ratio of central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA), short posterior ciliary artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) and ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean PSV and EDV (8.1+/-2.6 and 2.7+/-0.1 cm/sec, respectively) in the CRA were significantly lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> than in healthy controls (11.5+/-2.2 and 3.5+/-1.0 cm/sec, respectively, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, these values (12.7+/-4.2 and 4.3+/-1.1 cm/sec, respectively) were significantly lower in the patient group than in the control the group (18.2+/-4.2 and 6.1+/-2.5 cm/sec, respectively, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patient group, a statistically significant decrease compared to the control group was detected in the mean PSV of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (31.8+/-8.2 and 35.8+/-0.6 cm/sec, respectively, p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference in the other parameters of these vessels was observed between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the presence of some circulatory changes in the flow velocities of the CRA, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> when compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
