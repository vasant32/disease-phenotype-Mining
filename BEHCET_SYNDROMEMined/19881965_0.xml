<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of this disease have been described to be different according to geographical areas and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the specific clinical features of BD patients in Northeastern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 116 patients involved in this study fulfilled the classification criteria of the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations and results of laboratory tests of BD were recorded in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was typically between 20-39 years with a slight female predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcers</z:hpo> were the most common manifestation, followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction/<z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000031'>epididymitis</z:hpo> were rare in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesion and articular involvement were significantly higher in females, while gastrointestinal involvement was significantly higher in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of laboratory tests showed that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51 alleles were positive in 30.9% of patients and the immunological abnormities were present in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical features of BD showed geographical and gender difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Genetic and immune factors might participate in aetiopathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
