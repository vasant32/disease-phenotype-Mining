<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron-dense degenerated endothelial cells were found in the microcirculatory beds of the dermis and subcutaneous fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, electron microscopic X-ray spectroanalysis failed to demonstrate the localization of either chlorine or base metals in those degenerated endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, neither in ultrastructurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endothelial cells, nor in infiltrating macrophages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions the positive deposit of chlorine or base metals could not be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this analysis suggest that environmental factors do not play an etiologic role in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance of the degeneration of endothelial cells is not clear present </plain></SENT>
