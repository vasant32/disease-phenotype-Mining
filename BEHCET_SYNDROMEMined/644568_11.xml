<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative risk for a B5 carrier to develop BD was calculated to be 5.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients were offspring of consanguineous marriages, which is not unexpected in the populations studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients had only one HLA-B antigen, which in four cases was B5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the latter were B5 homozygotes, indicating a possible greater susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the reported association between BD and HLA-B5 in a populationnot previously investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these data support the suggestion that B5 is associated with BD in populations deriving from the Mediterranean Basin, the Middle East and Far East </plain></SENT>
