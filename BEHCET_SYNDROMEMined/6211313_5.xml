<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amongst patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> PHA and Con A were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly reduced; numbers of circulating T gamma cells were unaltered whereas T mu cells were reduced (P less than 0  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>05) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast to SLE where a marked reduction in responses to PHA and Con A was found with reduced T gamma cell but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T mu cell numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the mean suppressor cell activity in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group was significantly reduced, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had values within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, in contrast with SLE where the reduction was much more marked and most patients had values below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the pattern of alteration in T mu and T gamma cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is distinct from that in SLE, and the reduction of short-lived suppressor cell activity is only mild in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome but marked in SLE </plain></SENT>
