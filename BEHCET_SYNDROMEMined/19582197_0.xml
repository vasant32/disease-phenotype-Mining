<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a series of 36 patients from Northern Greece is analyzed retrospectively in regard to the epidemiological, clinical and immunological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> (36/36, 100%), while 23/36 (63.9%) experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> and 22/36 (61.1%) developed ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skin manifestations were observed in 23/36 patients (63.9%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test was found positive in 14/36 patients (38.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other manifestations included central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, recurrent genitourinary <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammations</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laboratory findings were not specific, partly reflecting the severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ocular disease was more often observed in HLA-B51 (+) patients (20/31, 64.5%) than in HLA-B51 (-) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standard of care (SOC) treatment consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and aspirin, whereas refractory disease was treated with intravenous pulses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, anti-TNF agents (infliximab) were applied to treat refractory ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study come in agreement with those reported for other Mediterranean series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 seems to predispose to more severe disease, while early therapeutic intervention is beneficial for these patients </plain></SENT>
