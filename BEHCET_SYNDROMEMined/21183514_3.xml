<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical records of 14 patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received infliximab infusions (5 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2 and 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were frequency of clinically observable ocular inflammatory attacks, background <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and disc vascular leakage as assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography during periods of clinical quiescence, visual acuity and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up after initiating infliximab therapy was 19 months (range 12-29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, eight of 14 patients (57%) had experienced no inflammatory attacks, and the frequency of attacks was significantly reduced when compared with the 6-month period just prior to infliximab use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Background <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and disc vascular leakage assessed at 12 months improved in 11 of 14 patients (79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved or remained unchanged at 12 months in 26 of 28 eyes (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infliximab therapy was terminated in two patients owing to infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no serious adverse effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab over the first year of treatment appeared effective in reducing ocular inflammatory attacks, as well as background <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and disc vascular leakage, in patients with refractory uveoretinitis associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
