<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our study population was made up of 29 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and 28 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Audiometric pure-tone thresholds and transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) levels were determined in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were pure-tone audiometry (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) levels and TEOAE levels in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> detected a <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in 10 of the 29 patients (34.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in audiometric findings between the two groups was statistically significant at 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz (p ≤ 0.0498) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A comparison of TEOAE levels revealed that the difference in sound-to-noise ratio between the two groups was not significant at 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 kHz, but it was significant in 4 kHz (p = 0.02), and the difference in reproducibility between the two groups was significant at 2 and 4 kHz (p ≤ 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease should be screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> and subsequently treated if an impairment is discovered </plain></SENT>
