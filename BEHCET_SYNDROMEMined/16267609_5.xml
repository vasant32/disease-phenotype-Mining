<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate QoL and LS in patients with BD and determine the relationship with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients with BD and 40 control subjects were involved in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic properties were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by Turkish version of BD Current Activity Form (BDCAF) in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>QoL and psychological well-being were assessed by Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and Life Satisfaction Index (LSI), respectively, in both patients and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The related disease activity measures of QoL and LS were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two male and 19 female BD patients with a mean age of 33.3+/-9.3 years and 20 male and 20 female control subjects with a mean age of 33.3+/-4.1 years were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to BDCAF, no patient had central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 33 patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, 30 patients had articular involvement, 29 had mucocutaneous lesions, 27 had gastrointestinal involvement, 21 patients had ocular involvement, and 7 patients had vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The scores of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dimensions of NHP were significantly higher and the mean score of LSI was significantly lower in BD patients than in control subjects (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Correlation analysis indicated that the scores of <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, joint involvement, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were the most related factors for physical domains of NHP, whereas joint involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> were the most related activity measures for psychosocial subscales of NHP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LS was found to be most related with the scores of patient's and physician's impression of disease activity and joint involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with BD have impaired QoL and disturbed psychological well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Current management strategies focusing on <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, mucocutaneous lesions, and efforts to measure psychosocial aspects and symptoms of the patients by their point of view will help to improve QoL and raise the LS in patients suffering from BD </plain></SENT>
