<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-seven BD patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from medical files and from patients' interviews was collected, regarding the entire spectrum of disease manifestations, and a severity score was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgA- and IgG-ASCA levels, determined by ELISA, were studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD patients and in three control groups: patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen BD patients (48.1%) were ASCA-positive, compared to one patient in each control group (10%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean value of IgG-ASCA in the BD patients was 20.7 +/- 12.3 units, significantly higher than in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (10.0 +/- 5.5, p &lt; 0.001), SLE (11.8 +/- 9.3, p &lt; 0.03) or healthy volunteers (10.8 +/- 9.8, p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean IgA-ASCA level was 16.8 +/- 8.8 units in the BD patients, significantly higher compared to healthy volunteers (11.0 +/- 5.0, p = 0.02) but similar to patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (17.0 +/- 5.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between ASCA and any BD-associated clinical manifestation nor the presence of HLA-B5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in the rate of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> nor in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> severity score between positive- and negative-ASCA patients (27.3% vs. 30.8%, and 7.31 +/- 1.80 vs. 7.28 +/- 2.27 respectively, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study associate, for the first time, the presence of a distinct antibody, i.e. ASCA, with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ASCA were not linked to a specific clinical manifestation of the disease and probably do not pose an increased risk for a more severe disease course </plain></SENT>
