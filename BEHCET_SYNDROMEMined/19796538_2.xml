<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA samples were obtained from a Turkish population of 97 unrelated patients with BD, and 127 unrelated healthy control subjects.<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genotyping (IL-6, IL10, IFN-gamma, TGF-Beta1 and TNF-alpha) experiments were performed using sequence-specific primers PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TGF-Beta1 codon 25 GG genotype was found significantly lower in BD patients compared to healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IL-10 -1082 GA genotype was more frequent whereas the AA genotype was less common in the BD group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between clinial findings and cytokine gene polymorphisms was further investigated in the patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of IFN-gamma AA genotype was lower in the patients with genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it was found that the frequency of IL-6 -174 GG genotype was lower in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that TGF-Beta1 and IL-10 gene polymorphisms may affect host susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, to confirm the biological significance of our results, further studies should be performed on other population groups and in large number of cases </plain></SENT>
