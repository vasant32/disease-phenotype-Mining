<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We chronologically analyzed the clinical manifestations of BD in 412 patients meeting the Japanese criteria for BD seen at 2 Yokohama City University hospitals from July 1991 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of individual symptoms in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single initial symptom appeared earlier than any other manifestation in 78% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time from the initial symptom to diagnosis was 8.6 ± 10.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcer</z:hpo>, the most common initial manifestation, preceded the diagnosis by 7.5 ± 10.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and eye and skin involvement appeared 1 or 2 years before diagnosis, whereas gastrointestinal, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, or vascular involvement developed later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of eye involvement was significantly higher in patients with neurologic lesions, but significantly lower in those with gastrointestinal or vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no particular combination of major symptoms predicted the development of organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There has been a recent decrease in the rate of "complete" BD (patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 of the major symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and eye and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>), whereas the frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, gastrointestinal, and vascular involvement have been increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further assessment may allow the detection of early predictors of the more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e>, which requires more intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
