<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Interferon regulation factor 5 (IRF5) is a member of the IRF family of transcription factors that control the transactivation of type I interferon system-related genes as well as the expression of several other genes involved in immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated its association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) in a well defined group of Chinese Han patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 152 unrelated Chinese patients with BD and 149 healthy blood donors were genotyped for IRF5rs2280714 and rs752637 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) was performed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype frequencies of IRF5rs2280714 and rs752637 polymorphisms were compared between patients and controls using a two-sided chi(2) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed no significant difference concerning the frequency of the allele of rs2280714 and rs752637 polymorphisms between BD patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p=0.647 and p=0.105, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the genotype of rs2280714 and rs752637 were not different between BD patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p=0.233 and, p=0.266, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestation stratification analysis did not show any association of IRF5 polymorphisms with BD patients (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the rs2280714 and rs752637 SNPs were not associated with the susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the two polymorphisms of IRF5 and any extraocular clinical manifestations in BD </plain></SENT>
