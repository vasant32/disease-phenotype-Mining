<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed audiologic tests were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (27%) showed some degree of hearing loss; but in only 7 patients (9%) was the average of the frequencies between 500 to 4,000 Hz more than 25 dB hearing level, and the cochlear function of 43 patients (59%) was within the 25-dB range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The averaged pure tone audiograms of the two groups showed a statistically significant hearing loss in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No relationship could be found between hearing loss and other system involvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between hearing loss and duration of the disease, but the mean age of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with hearing loss was found to be significantly higher than the mean age of the patients without hearing loss </plain></SENT>
