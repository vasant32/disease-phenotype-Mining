<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: General intensive care unit of a tertiary care emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A 63-yr-old female who has a history of active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease that has been controlled with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, and who has <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A 5-mg/kg dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> was administered intravenously over a 60-min period under continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Samples from the arterial and venous blood catheters and from the ultradiafiltrate were collected over the next 12 hrs to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters and clearance of hemodiafiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: half-life of elimination phase 12.6 hrs; total clearance 0.55 mL/min/kg; and volume distribution of steady state 27.07 L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clearance of hemodiafiltration was 0.63 mL/min/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration is effective in removing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> from the blood </plain></SENT>
