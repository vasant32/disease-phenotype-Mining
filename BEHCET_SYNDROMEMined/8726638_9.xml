<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New drugs are being evaluated in cases unresponsive to conventional treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the efficacy of interferon alfa-2a on <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in 18 Behçet's disease patients who had predominantly mucocutaneous involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were treated with interferon alfa-2a at 3 million IU/day in the first week (three times a week), 6 million IU/day in the second week (three times a week), 9 million IU/day in the third week and thereafter (three times a week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interferon alfa-2a was administered subcutaneously for a total of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the treatment the efficacy of the drug was found to be good in 9 patients and very good in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interferon alfa-2a is particularly effective in skin manifestations such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>-nodosum-like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also found to be effective in systemic manifestations such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> and eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that interferon alfa-2a is a promising drug in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
