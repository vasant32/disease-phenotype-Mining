<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the copy number <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> of the DEFA1 gene encoding α-defensin-1 in samples from Korean individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) compared to healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recruited 55 BD patients and 35 HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A duplex Taqman® real-time PCR assay was used to assess CN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most samples (31.1%) had a CN of 5 with a mean CN of 5.4 ± 0.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the CN of the DEFA1 gene between BD patients and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high DEFA1 gene CN was significantly associated with intestinal involvement in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Variable DEFA1 gene <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17514">CNs</z:chebi> were observed in both BD patients and HC and a high DEFA1 gene CN may be associated with susceptibility to intestinal involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
