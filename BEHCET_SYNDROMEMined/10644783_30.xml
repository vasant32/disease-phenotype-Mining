<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI and MTI findings were compared in patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) and systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune mediated diseases</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDs</z:e>) affecting the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> to investigate their roles in understanding the nature of brain damage in these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain dual echo, T1 weighted and MTI scans were obtained in patients affected by systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erithematosus (SLE) with (NSLE, n=9) and without clinical <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement (n=15), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) (n=5), Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>) (n=9), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome (APLAS) (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with clinically definite MS and 15 healthy controls also underwent the same scanning protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI and MT ratio (MTR) images of the same subject were coregistered and postprocessed to obtain MTR histograms of the whole brain and of the NABT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain hyperintense lesions were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with MS and with NSLE and in 5/15 patients with SLE, 5/9 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>, 1/5 with BD, and 3/6 with APLAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lesion burden in the brain was significantly higher in patients with MS compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other disease groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> MTR histogram parameters were significantly different among patient subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with MS had significantly lower average MTR than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except patients with NSLE and significantly lower peak height and location than patients with SLE. patients with NSLE had significantly lower average MTR than patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic brain tissue damage is relevant in patients with MS, but, apart from patients with NSLE, it seems to be absent in systemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune mediated diseases</z:mpath>, even in the presence of macroscopic MRI lesions or clinical evidence of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement </plain></SENT>
