<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in Caucasian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> patients have shown an association with the -2518 A/G polymorphism of the monocyte chemoattractant protein (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>)-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether this polymorphism is also associated with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in Chinese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the possible involvement of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in the susceptibility to ocular BD in Chinese Han individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case control association study was performed in 296 ocular BD patients and 319 geographically and age-matched healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression analysis revealed a decreased frequency of the homozygous AA genotype and an increased frequency of AG genotype of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 -2518 polymorphism in ocular BD patients compared with healthy controls, when adjusted for gender (p = 0.048, p = 0.028, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when segregated on the basis of several clinical findings, no any association was found between this polymorphism and ocular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study suggests that the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 -2518 AA genotype seems to display a protective association with ocular BD, whereas the -2518 AG genotype might be a susceptible factor for ocular BD in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
