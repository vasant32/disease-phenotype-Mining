<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To evaluate the demographic, clinical, and ocular features of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) who had first symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after 40 years of age and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 42 patients with initial BD symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> after 40 years of age who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria afterwards, according to the International Study Group for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of ocular involvement: group 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and group 2 did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ocular characteristics of patients in group 1 were further examined according to age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1A included patients between 40-50 years of age, and group 1B included patients older than 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic features of uveitic and non-uveitic patients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ocular manifestations, treatment protocols, and ocular complications in uveitic patients were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ocular characteristics of group 1A and group 1B were further evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (61.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (group 1) and 16 (39.1%) had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between groups according to sex, age at initial admission, age at the time of initial symptom of BD, and period between initial symptom and the diagnosis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent initial manifestation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference between the groups was detected with regard to the mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of each symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>Anterior uveitis</z:hpo> (73.1%) was the most frequent type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> (19.2%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521677" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sclerouveitis</z:e> (7.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>Uveitis</z:hpo> was bilateral in 80.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> was higher in group 1B than in group 1A (P = 0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>Cataract</z:hpo> was the most common ocular complication, followed by macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> sequelae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, optic disc paleness, and branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> BD usually affects both genders equally, and the prognosis of ocular involvement is usually good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> decreases as age increases, while the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement is usually bilateral and there is no correlation between gender and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
