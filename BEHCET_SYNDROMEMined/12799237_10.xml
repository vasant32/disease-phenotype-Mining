<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the occurrence of conjunctival <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> as a manifestation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series with histopathologic correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and presented with painful conjunctival <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of these <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were biopsied and studied histologically and immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesions were treated with topical or subconjunctival injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and, in one case, with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, two developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and other signs of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease only months to years after the appearance of the conjunctival <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3- to 5-mm, round to oval <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were located in the limbal and/or bulbar conjunctiva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathology revealed disrupted epithelium, infiltration of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cells, and high endothelial venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the infiltrating lymphocytes revealed primarily T-cell populations admixed with several B cells and CD68-positive histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the conjunctival lesions invariably healed without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the oral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulceration</z:e>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> can also be found in the conjunctiva of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although this is a rare clinical sign, when accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> or orogenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, it may suggest a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
