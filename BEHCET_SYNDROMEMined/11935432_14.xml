<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> who had had short-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> therapy for about 23 weeks were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of attacks (number of attacks per year) and the longest period between the attacks were analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapy was judged to be effective if the patient had &lt; or =1 attack a year and/or &gt; or =1 year between the attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 51.4 +/- 32.5 months (range: 13-122 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the therapy, the mean frequency of attacks had decreased from 4.9 +/- 2.3 to 0.9 +/- 1.4 (p &lt; 0.0001) and the mean longest period between the attacks was prolonged from 4.4 +/- 2.3 months to 25.7 +/- 23.1 months (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ratio of severe attacks had decreased from 74.1 +/- 34% to 51.3 +/- 36.6% (p = 0.0218) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The best-corrected visual acuity was increased in 32.9%, decreased in 34.2%, and the same in 32.9% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phytsis bulbi developed in three (3.8%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New attacks were seen in 56.8% of patients and another <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi>(s) was given to 40.9% of the patients 1-8 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious side effects were observed during the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Short-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28830">chlorambucil</z:chebi> therapy for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is effective in controlling the disease in two-thirds of patients </plain></SENT>
