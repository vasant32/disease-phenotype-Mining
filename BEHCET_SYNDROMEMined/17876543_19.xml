<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to develop consensus-based practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease by using a modified Delphi approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three groups of Japanese gastroenterology specialists were involved in the study: moderators, an expert panel, and a professional group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical statements for ratings were extracted from relevant literature, a survey of the professional group, and by discussion among the expert panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expert panel rated the clinical statements according to a nine point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first round of ratings, a panelist meeting was held to discuss areas of disagreement and to clarify areas of uncertainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The list of clinical statements was revised after the panelist meeting, and a second round of rating was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two relevant articles were selected in a literature search, and 35 clinical statements were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additional 209 clinical statements were developed from the survey and discussion among gastroenterology specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the first and second rounds, 56% and 60% of statements, respectively, received median scores &gt; or =7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The range of scores decreased considerably from the first to the second round </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 5-Aminosalycylic acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, enteral nutrition, total parenteral nutrition, and surgical therapy were considered standard therapy for intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Infliximab, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicines</z:chebi>, thalidomide, other pharmacological therapy, endoscopic therapy, and leukocytapheresis were deemed experimental therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Based on a two-round modified Delphi approach, practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were developed </plain></SENT>
