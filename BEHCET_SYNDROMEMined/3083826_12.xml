<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were able to produce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of IL-2 in response to phytohemagglutinin; however, responsiveness to IL-2 was impaired in their concanavalin A-activated lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This defect was due to decreased numbers of cells bearing IL-2 receptors in patients with early active disease; in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active or with inactive disease, there was a decrease in density of IL-2 receptors on T cells bearing these receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unresponsiveness of T cells to IL-2 may thus contribute to immunologic aberrations in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
