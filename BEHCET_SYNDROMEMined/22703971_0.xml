<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to raise this therapeutic dilemma and to call for controlled studies to help establish guidelines to address this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with BD and major vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> whom we recently encountered are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their cases were presented to rheumatologists from Turkey, Israel and the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The physicians were asked about the kind of treatment they would give each patient at diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and if they chose to give anticoagulation and for long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five Turkish, 33 Israeli and 25 American rheumatologists responded to the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 87% of the Israeli and American rheumatologists would give anticoagulation at the time of diagnosis for the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> compared with only 40-44% of the Turkish physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these cases 56% of the American and 45% of the Israeli rheumatologists would give <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for life compared with only 5-18% of the Turkish physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regarding a case with intra-cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, 96% of American, 94% of Israeli, and 60% of Turkish rheumatologists would start anticoagulation at diagnosis while 70%, 39% and 33%, respectively would give this treatment for life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic approach towards <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease differs significantly among rheumatologists from different countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The different prevalence of the disease in these countries may explain this difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A randomised controlled prospective trial is needed in order to determine the exact role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment in BD </plain></SENT>
