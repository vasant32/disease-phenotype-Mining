<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eyes were studied as the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A variety of leakage patterns comprising posterior chamber leakage and paravascular leakage were detected in 32 eyes with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease by means of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> iris angiography, while no leakage was detected in the control eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These leakage patterns were frequently seen in the posterior type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> group of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients, but were scarce in the anterior type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By anterior segment fluorophotometry, the levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> concentration in the anterior chamber were significantly higher in the posterior type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> eyes of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients than those in either the anterior type <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> eyes or the controls (P less than 0.05-P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the damage to the vascular system still existed in the remission stage of the disease, and that this abnormality occurred more markedly in the posterior type group than in the anterior type group of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease eyes </plain></SENT>
