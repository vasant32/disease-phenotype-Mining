<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study represents the second report on its distribution among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 43 unrelated Lebanese <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients, had their DNA typed using sequence-specific primer technique for the presence of 16 KIR genes and pseudogenes loci, and compared them to the general Lebanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In addition to sharing common features with the general population, the AA genotype was still the most frequent--however, with five new KIR profiles identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant distribution of the different KIR genes between the cases (BD patients) and controls (Lebanese population); however, KIR3DP1*001/002 was found to be significantly different between the BD patients and the Lebanese population, but this significance was lost after correction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> KIR loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results lead to an interesting future research question of whether or not KIR genotype is involved in the predisposition to or pathogenesis of BD especially that a pseudogene is controversially in question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the second report that describes the KIR genotypic profile in such an important clinical disease but the first to shed a light on the possible role of a pseudogene </plain></SENT>
