<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma IL-6 level was not detected in any subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 concentrations in culture supernatants of patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were significantly high compared with patients with inactive disease and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we investigated IL-6 gene expression in cultured PBMC from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-6 gene expression was enhanced in active patients compared with inactive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
