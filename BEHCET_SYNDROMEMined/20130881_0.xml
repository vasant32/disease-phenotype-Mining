<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of the study is to study the pattern, frequency and outcome of vascular events in Omani patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty BD patients were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data parameters were recorded, including age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, disease duration, current disease activity, and the vascular manifestations of the disease (current and past events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease activity was assessed by ESR, CRP and also clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For venous and arterial thrombotic events, imaging studies, such as Doppler ultrasonography, angiography, MRI, CT, and echocardiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had vascular events (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of these patients at diagnosis of the vascular event was 24 years (range 15-37) and the mean disease duration at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the vascular event was 3.8 years (range 3-5); this was significant when compared with patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P=0.001, Mann-Whitney test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients with vascular involvement, two patients (22%) had venous lesions, three (33%) patients had arterial lesions and four patients (44%) had mixed lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients (22%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004937'>pulmonary artery aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi>) and concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e>, and further one patient also had <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy resulted in the resolution of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> and intracardiac thrombous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the frequency of vascular complications of BD in our patients is similar to those reported around the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found younger male patients with short disease duration are at a greater risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment with immunosuppressive therapy without anticoagulation seems successful in treating <z:chebi fb="3" ids="51133">PAA</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracardiac thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
