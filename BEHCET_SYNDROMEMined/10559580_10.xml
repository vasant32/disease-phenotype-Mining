<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent investigation of the etiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) has focused on heat shock proteins (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) which belong to the <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 60 family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (HP) and BD may cause <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in the gastrointestinal tract and, HP expresses <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Whether HP is linked to the pathogenesis of BD or not, and to investigate the influence of HP eradication on clinical parameters of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with BD were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group I comprised 49 patients and was investigated for HP seroprevalence and compared with age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group II comprised 20 patients with BD and HP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> diagnosed by serological and endoscopic examinations as well as the rapid urease test (RUT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 1-week eradication therapy was administered for HP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined for the course of BD at monthly intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two months after the eradication therapy, patients underwent an endoscopic examination and RUT for eradication control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were excluded because of eradication failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were evaluated for the influence of HP eradication on clinical manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The number and size of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> before the eradication and at the end of the follow-up period were compared statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HP seroprevalence between patients with BD and controls did not show significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients with BD, the number and size of oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> diminished significantly and various clinical manifestations regressed after the eradication of HP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HP may be involved in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
