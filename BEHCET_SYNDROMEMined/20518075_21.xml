<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively assess the development of visual acuity and the frequency and duration of relapse-free periods in patients who were treated with interferon-α (IFNα) for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and who completed a followup period of ≥2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IFN alfa-2a was administered at an initial dosage of 6 million IU per day, then tapered to a maintenance dosage of 3 million IU twice per week, and finally discontinued, if possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case of a relapse, IFN treatment was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity at the end of followup was compared with visual acuity when ocular disease was in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 53 patients (96 eyes), 52 (98.1%) responded to IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 47 patients (88.7%), IFN could be discontinued when the disease was in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty of these 47 (42.6%) needed a second treatment course during a median followup of 6.0 years (range 2.0-12.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved or remained unchanged in 91 eyes (94.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ocular disease was still in remission in 50% of the patients 45.9 months after cessation of the first IFN course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate tended to be lower in women than in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The BD activity score decreased significantly during followup, but long-term remission of nonocular BD manifestations was not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, since local treatments were sufficient, no systemic treatment was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that IFNα induces long-lasting remission in patients with severe ocular BD, resulting in a notable improvement in visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
