<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is the case report of a 52 years old female patient operated with Cabrol's method for the inflammatory lesion of the aortic root in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of incomplete type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had already been established 4 years ago and the patient had been taking regular check-up since then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About one year ago, newly developed <z:mp ids='MP_0006114'>cardiac murmur</z:mp> compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was detected and the patient was subsequently referred to us for the surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although aortic valve replacement (AVR) was attempted first, Cabrol's method was lastly chosen, since inflammatory features on the surface of the ascending aorta associated with slight aortic annular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> were observed during the procedure and it was easily anticipated that these might induce postoperative paravalvular leakage and pseudoaneurysm, if AVR were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after the surgery, the patient developed aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> associated with several other evidences of inflammatory recurrence, the steroid therapy was instituted with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post operative progress was uneventful and the patient has been completely well at the 6th month after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is strongly recommended the Cabrol's method should be chosen to prevent post operative unfavourable complications, whenever any evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is observed around the aortic root area </plain></SENT>
