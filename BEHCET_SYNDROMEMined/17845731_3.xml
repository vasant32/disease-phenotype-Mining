<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we aimed to dissect the effects of clinical disease activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment on endothelial function in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a case-control, cross-sectional study, we assessed endothelial function by endothelium dependent flow mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) at the brachial artery of 87 patients, who either were or were not receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment, and exhibiting variable clinical disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was also assessed in a prospective study of 11 patients before and after 7 days of treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> given at disease relapse (20 mg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the cross-sectional component of the study, FMD was lower in patients than in control individuals (mean +/- standard error: 4.1 +/- 0.4% versus 5.7 +/- 0.2%, P = 0.003), whereas there was a significant interaction between the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and disease activity on endothelial function (P = 0.014, two-factor analysis of variance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with inactive BD, those who were not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (n = 33) had FMD comparable to that in healthy control individuals, whereas those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (n = 15) had impaired endothelial function (P = 0.023 versus the respective control subgroup) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among patients with active BD, those who were not treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (n = 20) had lower FMD than control individuals (P = 0.007), but in those who were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> (n = 19) the FMD values were comparable to those in control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FMD was significantly improved after 7 days of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> administration (3.7 +/- 0.9% versus 7.6 +/- 1.4%, P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results imply that although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment may impair endothelial function per se during the remission phase of the inflammatory process, it restores <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> during active BD by counteracting the harmful effects of relapsing <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
