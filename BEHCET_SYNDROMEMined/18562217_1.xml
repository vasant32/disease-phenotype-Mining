<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient presented with a 20-year history of BD and a 10-year history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> refractory to various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under systemic treatment with interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-alpha) a complete remission of the cutaneous manifestations and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free state were achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The impressive therapeutic response of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and the non-neurological manifestations to IFN-alpha was also observed upon re-administration of this cytokine subsequent to a severe BD relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In view of this response and the lack of any other obvious etiology of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in our patient, it seems reasonable to consider them as being the sole manifestation of neuro-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient is presently completing a 40-month <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free follow-up, despite withdrawal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs for the last 35 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies on large numbers of patients are now warranted to define the therapeutic efficacy and safety of IFN-alpha in neuro-BD and particularly in neuro-BD-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
