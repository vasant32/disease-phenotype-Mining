<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL), a complement-like protein of collectin family, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MBL levels were measured in sera of 130 patients with BD, 64 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> (ROU), and 105 healthy controls (HC) with ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with BD had significantly lower median serum MBL levels compared to HC (1857 vs 3136 ng/ml, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed in median serum MBL levels between BD and ROU (2309 ng/ml, p = 0.252) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low MBL levels (&lt;/= 500 ng/ml) were present in a higher proportion of BD patients compared to HC (29% vs 16%, p = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A severe disease course (total clinical severity score &gt;/= 4) was more frequently observed in BD patients with very low serum MBL levels (&lt;/= 100 ng/ml) (19% vs 6%, p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When serum MBL levels were analyzed separately according to gender, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was higher in men with very low serum MBL levels (80% vs 42%, p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MBL deficiency might contribute to the pathogenesis of BD and affect its clinical course </plain></SENT>
