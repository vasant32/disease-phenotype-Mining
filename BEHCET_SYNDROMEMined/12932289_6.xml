<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that gamma/delta T cells are involved in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the capacity of gamma/delta T cells with phenotype Vgamma9/Vdelta2, from a group of Italian patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, to proliferate in the presence of various phosphoantigens and to express <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) and IL-12 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients and 45 healthy individuals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells were analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting, utilizing specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the expansion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells, lymphocytes were cultured in the presence of various phosphoantigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The expression of TNF receptor II and IL-12 receptor beta1 was evaluated with the simultaneous use of anti-TNF receptor II phycoerythrin-labelled (PE) or anti-IL-12 receptor beta1 PE and anti-Vdelta2 T-cell receptor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a certain hierarchy in the response of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells toward the different phosphoantigens, with the highest expansion factor obtained with dimethylallyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> and the lowest with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18222">xylose</z:chebi> 1P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expansion factor was fivefold greater in patients with active disease than in those with inactive disease or in control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TNF receptor II and IL-12 receptor beta1 expressions were increased in both patients and control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells bearing these receptors was raised in active disease when Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells were cultured in the presence of dimethylallyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell activation is correlated with disease progression and probably involved in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
