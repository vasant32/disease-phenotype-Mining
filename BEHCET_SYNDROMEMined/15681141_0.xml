<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We had previously obtained Streptococcus sanguinis (strain BD113-20), isolated from the oral cavity of patients with Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pathogenesis of this isolate, we examined neutrophil reactions and levels of cytokine production by lymphocytes after stimulation with the strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reactions of neutrophils were examined by chemiluminescence assay using whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amounts of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12, produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strain BD113-20 activated neutrophils from Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and healthy volunteers, and, in addition it increased the IFN-gamma production by lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients showed a dominant T helper-1 immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that both <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> stimulation and host hypersensitivity might be involved in the symptoms and pathogenesis of Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
