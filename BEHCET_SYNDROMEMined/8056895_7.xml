<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from 16 BD patients and compared with 11 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lymphocyte fraction was separated and diluted in RPMI-1640 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Candida as a target cell (T) was mixed with lymphocytes (E) (effector cells) in ratios of T:E 1/5 and T:E 1/25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the numbers of colonies were counted with controls, the anticandidal index (natural cytotoxicity) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Natural cytotoxicity relatively decreased in the active stage and increased in the inactive stage of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the difference between the mean value of natural cytotoxicity in the active stage and in the inactive stage was significant, the difference between the averages of active stage and the control group was insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the difference between inactive stage and the control group was remarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase of the natural cytotoxic activity in the inactive period of the disease may play a role together with other immune mechanisms in the aetiopathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
