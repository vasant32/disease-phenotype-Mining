<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>84% of the patients presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, the most common being mono-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> as the initial presentation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oligoarthritis</z:e> in subsequent episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 63% of the cases, the development was in episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found statistically significant association between antigens B-5 and B-51, and the group with BD, with a relative risk of 3.89 and 4.71 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The attempt to relate markers B-5, B-51 and B-27 to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> as well as to its manifestation and further development was not conclusive </plain></SENT>
