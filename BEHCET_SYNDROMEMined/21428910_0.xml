<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There may be some difficulties to differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> (RA), and herpetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthous ulceration</z:e>, from other mimicking <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite of unexpected sensitivity and responsiveness, the skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test regarding a non specific hypersensitivity has long been thought as one of auxiliary diagnostic benefits for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the potential usefulness and disease specificity of the prick reaction with saliva, a skin prick test with neat and filter-sterilized saliva was performed on the forearm skin of 26 individuals; 10 patients with BD (8 incomplete type without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, 1 complete type, and 1 neurological type), 5 with RA, 3 with herpetic oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e>, 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum alone, and 6 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the skin reaction at 48 hours after pricking, and the pricked <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> were biopsied and analyzed immunohistologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of 10 BD patients (90 %) exhibited an indurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> at the skin site pricked with self-saliva, whereas 3 of 5 RA patients (60%) were relatively weak reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pricking with filter-sterilized saliva failed to recapitulate any of positive skin reactions, albeit a faint erythematous dot appeared in a few BD patients, implicating the involvement of causative microorganism(s) in oral <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> flora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Culture of saliva from 3 randomly chosen BD patients revealed numerous streptococcal colonies on Mitis-Salivarius agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histology of the pricked skin sites showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, composed of CD4+ T cells and CD68+ monocyte/macrophage lineage, a feature consistent with a delayed type hypersensitive reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that skin prick test using self-saliva (a new diagnostic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>) can be a simple and valuable in vivo diagnostic approach for differentiating BD and RA from other mimicking mucocutaneous diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive skin prick may be triggered by resident intra-oral microflora, particularly streptococci, and may in part address the underlying <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> in BD </plain></SENT>
