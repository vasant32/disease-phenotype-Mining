<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine factors correlated with the progression of irreversible visual disturbance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo>, who presented with the first ocular episode, and who had been followed continuously for 5-10 years in our hospital, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed for gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, complete or incomplete type BD, HLA-B51 status, final visual acuity at the last remission period, mean number of ocular attacks per year, and clinical findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001094'>iridocyclitis</z:hpo> with profuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypopyon</z:e>, strong vitreous opacity blocking the observation of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels, diffuse <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and exudates with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> within the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular arcade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a visual acuity of &lt; or =20/200 and those with &gt;20/200 differed significantly in the mean number of ocular attacks per year and clinical findings of strong vitreous opacity and exudates within the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular arcade, but not with regard to the other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of ocular attacks showed a significant negative correlation with the outcome of visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis indicated a significant association of an average of more than three ocular attacks per year, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates within the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular arcade with poor visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that more than three ocular attacks per year, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates within the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular arcade are the risk and prognostic factors for a poor outcome of visual acuity in BD patients </plain></SENT>
