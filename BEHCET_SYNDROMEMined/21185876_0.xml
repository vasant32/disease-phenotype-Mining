<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Salusin-α and β are novel bioactive <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Salusin-α suppresses macrophage foam cell formation, while salusin-β stimulates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, decreased serum salusin-α level has been reported previously in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were to assess serum salusin-α level and its association with predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a cohort of patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study included 56 RA patients, 37 Behcet's disease (BD) patients, and 29 healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TNF-α, IL-6 and salusin-α levels, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index and common carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the RA and BD groups, salusin-α levels (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMTs</z:e> (p&lt;0.001 for both) were higher compared to the HC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the level of salusin-α was not directly associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serum salusin-α levels are increased in RA and BD, although they have increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Salusin-α has been reported to have anti-atherogenic effects in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it seems that salusin-α does not directly affect the atherogenesis in RA and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to understand the regulation of salusin-α and determination of its relations with the predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in RA and BD </plain></SENT>
