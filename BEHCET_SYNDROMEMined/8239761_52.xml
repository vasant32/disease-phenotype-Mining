<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 8-Oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a promutagenic DNA lesion induced by reactive oxygen intermediates, was measured by high performance liquid chromatography, coupled with electrochemical detection, in hydrolysates of DNA which had been extracted from lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear leucocyte fractions of human blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, human primary blood lymphocytes stimulated by concanavalin A were assayed for cytotoxicity induced by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> on day 0, by assessing cell proliferation during seven days of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Constitutive 8-oxodG was detectable (mean (2 SEM) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">moles</z:e> 8-oxodG/10(6) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">moles</z:e> deoxyguanosine) in DNA isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human blood lymphocytes (68 (8), n = 26) and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (118 (24), n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte DNA from donors with the following inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> contained significantly higher levels of 8-oxodG than that from healthy donors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (98 (16)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (137 (28)), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (100 (32)), and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (92 (19)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte 8-oxodG levels in non-autoimmune controls and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> were not significantly different from those of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of 8-oxodG were significantly higher in the DNA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> polymorphonuclear leucocytes than in paired DNA samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes, but there were no differences between levels of 8-oxodG in polymorphonuclear leucocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of 8-oxodG did not correlate with disease duration, disease severity, or age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, but not those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, also showed cellular hypersensitivity to the toxic effects of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was increased genomic DNA damage, and increased susceptibility to cytotoxic killing by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, in lymphocytes from patients with certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results might be explained by defective repair of DNA damage or by increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although more direct studies are needed, the evidence available favours the former explanation </plain></SENT>
