<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare neurological involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease as documented by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with clinical, neuroradiological, somatosensory (SEP) and auditory evoked potential (BAEP) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four patients were studied over an 8 year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had follow-up studies done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TMS central motor conduction (CMC) studies to upper and lower limb muscles, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), SEP, and BAEP testing were conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients had CMC slowing, decreased amplitude or absent motor evoked potentials (<z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi>); 5 of these patients were neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concordance of TMS results, clinical deficits, and MRI findings occurred in 36 of the 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SEP and BAEP testing proved non-complementary to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generally, follow-up studies revealed faster CMC and higher <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in two patients the CMC time to one target muscle became prolonged with diminished <z:chebi fb="164" ids="34757">MEP</z:chebi> amplitude over a period of 1.5-3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TMS can be useful in detecting and quantifying motor tract dysfunction in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and provides functional information complementary to imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TMS is more sensitive than either SEP or BAEP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our longitudinal studies suggest that TMS studies may be valuable in monitoring disease activity or therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
