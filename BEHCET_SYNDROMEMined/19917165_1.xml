<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We tested whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is characterized by alterations of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs),which are involved in vascular homeostasis and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 30 BD patients and 27 matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EPCs were defined and measured by flow cytometry according to the expression of CD34, CD133 and KDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that BD patients had significantly lower levels of CD34+KDR+ and CD34+CD133+KDR+ EPCs than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found significant negative correlations between EPC phenotypes and BD duration, while there were positive correlations between CD34+KDR+ EPCs and both BD activity scores and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower EPC levels with increasing disease duration was shown in univariate analysis and in multivariable analysis adjusted for possible confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first report that BD is associated with progressive EPC decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduction of EPCs may represent a mechanism of induction and/or progression of vascular injury in these patients </plain></SENT>
