<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, clinical and laboratory findings, and treatment and clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the charts of 220 patients fulfilling the international diagnostic criteria of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From them, we selected those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo>, and analyzed their epidemiological and clinical imaging features and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven male patients, mean age 29 years and already diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of hepatic veins was associated with inferior vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had other venous thromboses (superior vena cava and lower limbs) and one also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient was positive for anticardiolipin antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had anticoagulation therapy, and six had high-dose corticotherapy associated, in two cases, with monthly cyclophosphamid intravenous pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was favourable in six cases, and one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is 3.2%, confirming that this syndrome is not uncommon in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inferior vena cava is frequently involved in combination with hepatic veins and often associated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The prognosis may be favorable with medical interventions, including anticoagulation, treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and the use of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> when required </plain></SENT>
