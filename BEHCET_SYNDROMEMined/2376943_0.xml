<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> has been controlled better, as indicated by the reduced frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and there was an initial improvement in visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been possible to prevent a slight, gradual loss of visual acuity over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relapses were observed after dose reductions to blood levels below 400-500 ng/ml and following discontinuation of CS-A therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few relapses occurred at higher CS-A concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was found that both types of relapse could be controlled by increasing the CS-A dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An at least transitory increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels as a side effect of CS-A was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors' results and reports in the literature suggest that CS-A is an effective immunosuppressive therapy in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and is superior to other immunosuppressives used so far </plain></SENT>
