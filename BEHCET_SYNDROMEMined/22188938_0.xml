<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our preliminary results with endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic pathologies in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data regarding seven patients with abdominal aortic pathologies (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, pseudoaneurysm, and aortoenteric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were treated with endovascular stent-grafting between 2002 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients (aged, 39.1 ± 9; range, 27-52 years) with a mean aortic diameter of 58.4 ± 6.3 mm received endovascular stent-grafts, two patients being in emergency settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were in active disease state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four tube-shaped, two aorto-bi-iliac, and one aorto-uni-iliac stents were implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient expired on day 28 with multiorgan failure after emergency stent-grafting owing to enlarging periprosthetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> following open surgery for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another patient was declined for endovascular therapy owing to hypoplastic aortoiliac vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular approach provides a reasonable alternative to open repair for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> in select cases; however, in emergency settings, endovascular repair may well have an important, but limited, role in select patients with aortoenteric fistulae, it may yet require a surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
