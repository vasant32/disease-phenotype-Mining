<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), 30 patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> and 30 healthy individuals as control group were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ISG criteria was used for the diagnosis of BD and patients were classified as active and inactive and evaluated accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patient and control groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) levels were determined using ELISA method and antithrombin III (AT-III) by nephelometric methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High levels of endothelial product, vWF in the active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patient group (p &lt; 0.005) supports endothelial destruction due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> related with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the active patient group tPA levels were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than the inactive and control groups with higher levels of PAI (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, besides the decrease in tPA synthesis, high PAI levels also can affect tPA decrease and lead to inhibition of fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet group, levels of AT-III were low and no significant difference was observed in recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This situation may arise from the excessive use of AT-III in active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high levels of vWF in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients is thought to arise from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and high levels of PAI from the accumulation of thrombocytes on the damaged surface of endothelium leading to a decrease in tPA levels and inhibition of fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
