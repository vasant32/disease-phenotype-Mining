<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the PMNs from both groups of subjects were found in the population with the highest surface charge; the remainder being in the other distributions, which were collectively termed the slow cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the percentage of rheumatoid PMNs (mean 42%) ascribed to the slow population when compared with PMNs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (mean 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar increase in the slow cell population was also seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Felty's syndrome</z:e> (mean 38%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (mean 51%), but not in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (mean 18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synovial fluid aspirated from the knee joints of patients with RA contained PMNs with the lowest surface charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With nylon fibre as an adherence substrate cells of a low surface charge were found to be more adherent than those of a high surface charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An alteration in the electrophoretic distribution of PMNs may represent changes that are related to the expression of functionally related membrane ionogenic groups </plain></SENT>
