<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying mechanisms of increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> are not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is stated that the changes in blood rheology such as erythrocyte deformability take part in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are limited numbers of studies with conflicting results about the erythrocyte deformability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The previous studies were not limited to the untreated patients with active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Blood samples were filtered immediately by "Imugard- leukocyte removal filter" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After plasma and erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation, 10% erythrocyte suspensions were prepared with isotonic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9754">Tris</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> buffer solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These erythrocyte suspensions were filtered under gravitational force by "Nucleopore" to determine the filtration time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The filtration times of the erythrocyte and buffer solutions were referred as t1 and t2 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, deformability indices were obtained by dividing the t1 by t2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the deformability of the erythrocytes would result in an increase in the filtration time of the erythrocyte suspension and deformability indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median deformability indices were 3.090 and 2.170 for patients and control subjects respectively and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that the decrease in erythrocyte deformability in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> may be related to oxidative damage of erythrocytes and subsequently takes part in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
