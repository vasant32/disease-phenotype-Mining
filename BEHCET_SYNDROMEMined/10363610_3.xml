<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> presents many difficulties, including suture detachment and progression of vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We here report the various surgical procedures used to treat these disorders and their long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We operated on 14 patients: eight with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu's disease</z:e>, three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, and one with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups as follows; patients (n=7) requiring aortic valve replacement; patients (n = 4) requiring reconstruction of the coronary artery; and patients (n = 3) requiring <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no early or late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the postoperative follow-up period of 70 +/- 40 months, but there was one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients received postoperative steroids due to progression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there were no major complications such as valve detachment, pseudoaneurysmal formation, or occlusion of the bypass conduit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that it is crucial to reduce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> pre- and postoperatively, to reinforce the suture line, and to carefully select the operative procedures when treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
