<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the pathognomonic changes of intestinal lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to determine effective therapeutic measures, we recruited 13 patients with the intestinal form of this disease for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed pathology studies on the resected specimens of 7 patients and treated 5 of the other 6 patients with a low-residue diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathology examination revealed that 6 of 7 had inflammatory ulcerations in the ileocecal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ileal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were mainly on the antimesenteric side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed remnants of Peyer's patches at the margins of the major ulcerative lesions in 2 of 2 patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were aggregations of lymphocytes resembling destroyed lymph follicles in the superficial layer at the mouths of small fissuring lesions, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> scars were also noted in Peyer's patches in 4 of 5 other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>X-ray and endoscopic examinations revealed the disappearance of intestinal lesions in 5 patients within 1 month during, or following the low-residue diet treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found the intestinal lesions of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease at sites coinciding with intramucosal lymphoid tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The "rest cure" for the affected bowel was effective, i.e., there was significant alleviation of gastrointestinal symptoms and the intestinal lesions disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> exudative <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation, and consequent ulceration may occur in these tissues by the same mechanisms as those that operate in the positive needle-prick reactions seen in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
