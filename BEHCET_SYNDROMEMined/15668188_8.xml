<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a procarboxypeptidase downregulating plasmin formation, thereby causing a tendency for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, which is commonly complicated by arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, we aimed to find out plasma TAFI levels in BD, compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also searched whether plasma TAFI levels were significantly different between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's subgroups with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 105 BD patients (M/F: 64/41; mean age 36+/-1 years), followed up by Ege University Rheumatology Department were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exclusion criteria were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic diseases</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, antiphospholipid positivity, oral contraceptive use and pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age-and sex-matched healthy controls (n=53) were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma TAFI levels were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since TAFI is also an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactant, we also measured other inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma TAFI levels were significantly higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (91.1+/-7.4 ng/ml) compared with healthy controls (14.3+/-4.5 ng/ml) (P&lt;0.001), but there were no significant difference between the subgroups with and without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In BD, there was no correlation between plasma TAFI levels and CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of manifest <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, plasma TAFI levels in BD were significantly higher than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High TAFI levels might possibly contribute to the thrombotic tendency in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies investigating TAFI gene polymorphism and functional activity are clearly needed, to clarify the exact role of TAFI in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
