<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the pulmonary vascular status in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) shares the same uptake, storage and release mechanisms as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, associated with the functional state of pulmonary endothelium, it may reflect endothelial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (13 males, 12 females; mean age, 36.44 years) and 12 age-matched controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After intravenous injection of 123I-MIBG, thorax images were taken at 15 min and 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Appropriate regions of interest were drawn, and heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratios and lung retention indices (LRI) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between the LRI of controls (75.6+/-4%) and patients (87.7+/-10%) was found to be extremely significant (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LRIs of active (92.85+/-12%) and inactive (83.65+/-5%) states of BD were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the H/M ratios of controls (2.4+/-0.27) and patients (2.39+/-0.31) or between patients in active and inactive <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed prolonged lung retention of 123I-MIBG in BD, probably reflecting the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 123I-MIBG lung retention is a valuable finding in the evaluation of pulmonary vascular status and may be a potential marker of prognosis in BD </plain></SENT>
