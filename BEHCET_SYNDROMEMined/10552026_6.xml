<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They underwent 25 MRI examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The images were independently analysed for the number, type and anatomical location of lesions shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 18 abnormal studies (13 initial and 5 follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FLAIR sequence detected significantly more lesions than the SE TE 80 (P &lt; 0.05) and SE TE 20 (P &lt; 0.01) sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was particularly useful for demonstrating lesions in the juxtacortical white matter, which accounted for over half the lesions detected on the FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, seven had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and five had abnormal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presenting with focal neurological signs had abnormal imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found supratentorial and, in particular, juxtacortical lesions to be more frequent than previously described </plain></SENT>
