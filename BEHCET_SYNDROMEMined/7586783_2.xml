<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (14 males, 14 females: mean age 36.2 +/- 8.1 SD years) from the APZ group and 29 patients (18 males, 11 females; mean age 34.2 +/- 8.4 SD years) from the placebo group completed the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end of the trial the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> persisted in 53.5% (15/28) of the APZ patients and in 41.3% (12/29) of the placebo patients (chi 2 = 0.85; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients (6/28; 21%) from the APZ group and 9 patients (9/29; 31%) from the placebo group developed new joint involvement (chi 2 = 0.7; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> between the two groups (19.9 +/- 8.3 SD days in the APZ groups vs. 19.7 +/- 8.2 SD days in the placebo group; NS) </plain></SENT>
