<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of neurological manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) in patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) compared with those on other medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 117 patients with BD who visited our hospital between 1990 and 2003 were reviewed with respect to symptoms and medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> episodes of constant therapy prior to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement were counted, and then the associations were analysed by the exact Fisher-Freeman-Halton test and adjusted for multiple tests by the Bonferroni-Holm method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed ten new cases of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> manifestations in our patients with BD being regularly seen and treated in our tertiary care centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of neuro-BD in our patient group was 8.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective analysis, the incidence of new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> (neuro-BD) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with BD who regularly visited our hospital was significantly higher in patients on CSA than in those on other medications (6 of 21 vs 0 of 175 episodes, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This contrasts the obvious efficacy of CSA on extracerebral manifestations of BD, such as severe ocular disease, mucocutaneous lesions or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSA exerts differential efficacy on various manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is very effective for severe ocular and other moderate to severe manifestations of BD, but its efficacy for the prevention of neuro-BD seems to be inferior to that of other medications used in BD, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or interferon-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reasons for this are unclear, but the potential toxic effects of CSA on the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> may be a predisposing factor for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
