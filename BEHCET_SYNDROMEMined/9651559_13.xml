<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An open clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Departments of Dermatology and Ophthalmology, University of Patras, Greece and Department of Dermatology, Heinrich-Heine University of DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Twelve patients (aged 23-52 years) with active BD who had previously been unsuccessfully treated with systemic steroids and/or immunosuppressives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: IFN-alpha was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 6 X 10(6) IU per day 3 times per week for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change of area or number of mucocutaneous lesions, grading score for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo>, haematological and biochemical parameters and number of episodes during the pretreatment period and the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of IFN-alpha side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients (75.0%) revealed a complete remission, two (16.6%) a partial remission and one patient (8.3%) showed no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up in five out of the nine complete responders (55.5%) no episodes of BD were seen, whereas, the other four patients (44.5%) had 1-2 episodes, as compared to 5-8 and 5-12 episodes, respectively, during the pretreatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like syndrome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo>) appeared during the early phase of therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (but one) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient had to discontinue IFN-alpha because of intolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous human recombinant interferon alpha-2a appears to be an effective and fairly well tolerated therapy for BD </plain></SENT>
