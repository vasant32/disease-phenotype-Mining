<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Surgical treatment of arterial lesions associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) is often complicated by graft occlusion and recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the long-term outcome of surgical intervention for arterial involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with BD (9 men, 1 woman) who underwent surgical treatment for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> between 1980 and 2004 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age of patients at the first operation ranged from 36 to 69 years (mean, 50.4 +/- 9.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean period between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BD and that of arterial manifestations was 8.0 +/- 5.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their postoperative courses, including survival, graft occlusion, formation of anastomotic false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at different sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the chronologic incidence of complications after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 133 +/- 92 months, ranging from 5 to 285 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died of rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> after undergoing several surgical interventions for multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were five graft occlusions among 21 grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative primary graft patency rate in the infrainguinal region was 83.9% at 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five anastomotic false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> formed among 49 anastomoses between grafts and host arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall cumulative incidence of formation of anastomotic pseudoaneurysm was 12.9% at 5 and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them formed within 18 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Development of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in different arteries was observed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early occurrence of anastomotic false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is characteristic of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is necessary to establish effective postoperative treatment </plain></SENT>
