<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male) who took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZA a mean +/- SD of 94 +/- 10 months previously were reevaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The emergence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (log rank chi2 = 5.6, P = 0.02) and a 2-line drop in the visual acuity of the right eye (log rank chi2 = 5.9, P = 0.015) occurred significantly more frequently among the patients originally allocated to the placebo group compared with patients who originally received AZA, despite posttrial treatment for patients in both groups when needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend toward more frequent occurrence of extraocular complications in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effect of AZA was especially pronounced among patients who had eye involvement of short duration prior to their entry into the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early treatment with AZA tends to favorably affect the long-term prognosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
