<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the HLA-B51 antigen has been recently identified to comprise three alleles, HLA-B* 5101, HLA-B* 5102, and HLA-B* 5103, we sought to investigate whether there is any correlation of one particular allele among them with B51-positive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-six Japanese patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and HLA-B51 were typed by using the alloantisera, which allowed the subdivision of B51 antigen by the microlymphocyte toxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were found to carry HLA-B* 5101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that amino acid substitutions at residue 167 or 171 prevent the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, because HLA-B* 5101 differs from HLA-B* 5102 and HLA-B* 5103 by single amino acid substitution at residues 171 and 167, respectively, or that another non-HLA gene tightly linked to the HLA-B* 5101-associated haplotype around the HLA class I gene region is responsible for the susceptibility to Bechçet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism underlying an HLA association with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
