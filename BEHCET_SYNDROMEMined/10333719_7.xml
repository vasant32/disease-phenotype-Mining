<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using IgM-ELISA, we found AECA in 42 (56%) of 75 sera samples from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in a previous study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 15 AECA-positive sera of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients had an increased expression of the intercellular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1), 93.3% of the sera induced the vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and 100% of the serum induced the E-selectin molecule on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After stimulation of HDMEC with AECA-positive sera of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients, the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on HDMEC increased significantly at 4 hours, reaching a peak at 16 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of E-selectin was induced at 1 hour after stimulation with a peak at 4 hours and it decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adherence of T lymphocytes to HDMEC increased significantly after stimulation with AECA-positive sera from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, the adherence of T lymphocytes to HDMEC increased at 4 hours and returned to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that AECA-positive sera of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients are capable of activating HDMEC to promote the adherence of T lymphocytes to increase the expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin on the cell surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The whole process may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
