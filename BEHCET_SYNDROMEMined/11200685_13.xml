<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the humoral response against alpha B-crystallin, the sera and CSF samples of patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barré syndrome</z:e> (GBS), neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (NBD) and other non-inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (NIND) were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-alpha B-crystallin IgG and IgM antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum and CSF IgG antibody responses to alpha B-crystallin were significantly elevated only in NBD patients (serum IgG, NBD 1.29 +/- 0.49 vs. NIND 0.95 +/- 0.39, P = 0.01; CSF IgG, NBD 1.22 +/- 0.64 vs. NIND 0.81 +/- 0.35, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, high serum IgM antibody titres were also detected in NBD (1.83 +/- 0.72 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.49, P = 0.0005) and in MS (1.57 +/- 1.07, P = 0.046), whereas elevated CSF IgM responses were observed only in GBS (2.09 +/- 1.09 vs. 1.41 +/- 0.7, P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Humoral responses against alpha B-crystallin are increased in NBD and GBS, which may implicate this central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system antigen in the causation and pathogenesis of these inflammatory <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders </plain></SENT>
