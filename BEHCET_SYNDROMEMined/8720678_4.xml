<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> and disc neovascularizations, which occur as a result of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, can cause recurrent vitreal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and neovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001141'>severe visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1080 eyes of 540 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were examined between 1973 and 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 912 eyes with posterior segment involvement, laser photocoagulation could be performed in 13 of 25 eyes with disc neovascularization (NVD), 12 of 22 eyes with <z:mp ids='MP_0008852'>retinal neovascularization</z:mp> (NVE), and 4 of 6 eyes with NVD and NVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser was directed at areas of NVE and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> capillary nonperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cases of NVD, panretinal photocoagulation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of regression of NVD was significantly greater in laser-treated eyes than in the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results were similar in cases of NVD with NVE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In eyes with NVE which underwent laser photocoagulation, the NVE regressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the treated eyes developed neovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>Vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in two laser-treated eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laser photocoagulation is successful in preventing complications of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and disc neovascularizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, in cases of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, laser photocoagulation should be considered for prevention of complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007902'>vitreous hemorrhage</z:hpo> and neovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
