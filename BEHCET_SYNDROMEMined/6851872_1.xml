<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histologically the changes were largely confined to the venules of the middle and lower corium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endothelium was swollen, in part the vascular walls were destroyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the perivascular spaces there was round-cell infiltration, mixed with numerous neutrophilic granulocytes, some of them disintegrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence-microscopy revealed perivascular deposition of complement C3 and C1q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fresh lesions there were also IgG or IgM precipitates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immuno-electron microscopy also demonstrated complement C3 subendothelially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>Fibrin deposition</z:mpath> and disintegrating neutrophilic granulocytes marked the leukocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together the findings indicate that an immune-complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> takes part in the pathogenic mechanism of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_691'>pustule</z:mpath> formation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
