<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Change of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism and an imbalance of the oxidant-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system related to the disease activity have been reported in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a tendency of oxidative modification of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in patients with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum autoantibodies against oxidatively modified <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (oxLDL) as a marker for the degree of in vivo oxidation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum autoantibodies against oxLDL, total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (Apo) AI, Apo B, alpha1-antitrypsin, alpha2-macroglobulin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were determined in 37 patients and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoantibodies against oxLDL were measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum autoantibody levels against oxLDL were significantly higher in patients than in controls (425 +/- 365 and 187 +/- 132 mU/ml, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of autoantibodies against oxLDL in the patients were found to correlate with total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and alpha1-antitrypsin levels (r = 0.38, p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.42, p &lt; 0.05; r = -0.38, p &lt; 0.05; r = 0.42, p &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It has been shown in previous studies that high autoantibody titers against oxLDL may be important in diseases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High autoantibody titers against oxLDL are not specific for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease but probably important for pathologic processes in the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that increased levels of autoantibodies against oxLDL may be a factor responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> and development of vascular pathology in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
