<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The circadian rhythm of the serum level of the protein was recognized in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak value was at 1800 hours in the healthy subjects and at 2200 hours in those with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the exact mechanism underlying the rhythmic variation in this clinical marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reaction is unknown, the close interaction between the immune system and the rhythmicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data also suggest that the time of day when sampling is carried out should be considered when evaluating the levels of IAP </plain></SENT>
