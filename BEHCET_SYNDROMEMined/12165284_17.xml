<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the coagulation and fibrinolytic activities and the plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels of Korean BD patients in two cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first study regarding coagulation and fibrinolytic activities, the levels of fibrinogen and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) antigen were significantly higher in the BD patients than in the healthy controls (387.7+/-24.3 versus 240.6+/-8.8 mg/dl, p&lt;0.001, and 131.9+/-8.8 versus 105.2+/-0.3%, p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of antithrombin III (AT III) was significantly lower in the BD patients (92.8+/-3.2 versus 106.3+/-2.6%, p&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the levels of plasminogen, protein C, or protein S activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C (APC) resistance was not observed in any BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second study, the plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels of patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (11.9+/-3.0 micromol/l) or disease activity (12.5+/-3.8 micromol/l) were found to be significantly higher than those of the controls (9.2+/-2.6 micromol/l, p&lt;0.05, both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations in the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> patients were positively correlated with plasma vWF levels; a relationship which suggests injury of the vascular endothelium (Spearman coefficient=0.857, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormality</z:hpo> did not contribute to thrombotic complications, and higher levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> may play a role in the hypercoagulablity of BD patients </plain></SENT>
