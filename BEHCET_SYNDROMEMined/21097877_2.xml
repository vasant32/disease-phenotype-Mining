<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare a single infusion of the anti-TNF antibody infliximab vs CSs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> attacks in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, observational study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, who received either an infliximab infusion (5 mg/kg, 19 eyes) or high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> intravenously (1 g/day for 3 days, 8 eyes), or intra-vitreal triamcinolone acetonide (4 mg, 8 eyes) at attack's <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline maintenance therapy remained unchanged during the following 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity, anterior chamber cells, vitreous cells and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the posterior eye segment were assessed at baseline and at Days 1, 7, 14 and 29 (±1) post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While no significant differences were noted between i.v. and intra-vitreal CSs, infliximab was faster than CSs in decreasing total <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> scores and fundus <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> scores (P = 0.01 and P &lt; 0.0001 for treatment × time(2) interaction, respectively, using generalized estimating equation analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independently of time, infliximab was superior to CSs in clearing <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.003), as well as in resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> (P = 0.008) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular oedema</z:hpo> (P���&lt; 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a faster regression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular oedema</z:hpo> was observed with infliximab compared with CSs (P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of the three treatment modalities on visual acuity were comparable from baseline to the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No side effects were noted with infliximab or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, whereas intra-vitreal triamcinolone acetonide caused ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in four of the eight eyes, requiring surgical intervention in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single infusion of infliximab should always be considered, even as an adjunct therapy, for the control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> attacks in BD </plain></SENT>
