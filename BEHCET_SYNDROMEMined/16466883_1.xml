<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 51 people studied, 17 had <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with ocular involvement, 17 had <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without ocular involvement, and 17 were healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single eye was examined in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), time-averaged maximum velocity (Tamax), and resistance index (RI) were evaluated in the ophthalmic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>), posterior ciliary (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> (CRA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the average blood flow velocities in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein (CRV), and acceleration time (AT) and pulsatility index (PI) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean EDV in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> was 25% lower and RI was higher in patients with ocular involvement of BD than in patients without involvement (p = 0.006 and p = 0.005, respectively) and in healthy controls (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences were smaller in comparisons of the CRA and absent on comparisons of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The acceleration time of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was significantly higher in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in healthy controls (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the flow hemodynamics in retrobulbar circulation has more altered <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with ocular involvement than without ocular involvement and healthy control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the cerebral hemodynamic might be affected in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
