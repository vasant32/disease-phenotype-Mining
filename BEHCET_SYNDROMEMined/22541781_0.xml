<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients were men and died after a protracted clinical course characterized by various brain stem symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autopsies revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> non-specific brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, which is a typical neuropathological feature of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, many binucleated neurons (19, 20, and 55 neurons in each case) were found in the pontine nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison, the occurrence of binucleated neurons in the pontine nuclei was examined in 67 control cases including various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 55 cases (82.1%) among them, no binucleated neurons were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 12 cases (17.9%), the pontine nuclei contained 1 or 2 binucleated neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations confirmed that the occurrence of many binucleated neurons in the pontine nuclei was a characteristic finding in neuro- <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the pathogenetic mechanism for the formation of binucleated neurons is unknown, it is most likely the result of abortive cell division of neurons or fusion of the perikarya of the adjacent neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It probably reflects the presence of intense local noxious stimuli affecting neurons in the pontine nuclei </plain></SENT>
