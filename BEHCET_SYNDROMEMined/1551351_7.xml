<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria, nine of whom agreed to participate in this endoscopic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, three of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e> alone, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyspepsia</z:e>, one had symptoms of acid regurgitation, and the remainder were asymptomatic at the time of endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had evidence of grade 1 reflux <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, one had an incidental pyloric canal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, and one patient who had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> on presentation was found to have a high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002043'>esophageal stricture</z:hpo> with accompanying ulceration </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the incidence of esophageal involvement was low (11%), we conclude that unless the patient had marked esophageal symptoms there is no indication for routine endoscopy of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
