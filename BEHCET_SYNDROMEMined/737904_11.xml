<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination of centrifuged pellets of serum from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> revealed the presence of a large number of membrane fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these membranes showed numerous 10 nm holes that were identical to lesions produced by the action of complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to correlate complement levels, antibodies and cellular immunity with the presence of the membrane fragments, without success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a significant correlation was found between the membranes and the IgG class of immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding of membrane fragments with complement-induced damage predominantly in the blood of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e>, and the association with soluble immune complexes suggest that the latter may generate C5b-9 complexes which may bind to the surface of cells in result in cell lysis </plain></SENT>
