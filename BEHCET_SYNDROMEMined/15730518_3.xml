<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the MBL2 gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes are known to increase the susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> and to alter the serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulated that the haplotypes of the MBL2 gene influence therapeutic response in BD, thus affecting the clinical symptoms in 282 BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The promoter region, MBL2-550*C/*C (L/L) homozygote was found to have a lower frequency in BD patients than that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed in the allele frequencies of G-221C (Y/X), C+4T (P/Q) or Gly54Asp (A/B) of the MBL2 gene in BD patients and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HYPA haplotype contributed to BD occurrence, whereas the LYPA haplotype was negatively associated with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD patients with several symptoms and with an earlier disease-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age had a higher HYPA haplotype frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BD patients showing poor response (S) to therapy had a higher HYPA frequency than those showing good response (M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems that possessing HYPA increases the risk of BD and that the MBL2 HYPA haplotype plays a role in MBL levels and increases the susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
