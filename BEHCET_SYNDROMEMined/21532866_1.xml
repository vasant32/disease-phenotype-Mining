<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the association between extracellular HMGB1 expression and disease activity, and clinical features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extracellular HMGB1 expression in the sera of 42 BD patients was measured and was compared to that of 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMGB1 expression was significantly increased in BD patients compared to healthy controls (78.70 ± 20.22 vs 10.79 ± 1.90 ng/mL, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, HMGB1 expression was significantly elevated in BD patients with intestinal involvement compared to those without (179.61 ± 67.95 vs 61.89 ± 19.81 ng/mL, P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant association was observed between HMGB1 concentration and other clinical manifestations, or disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that extracellular HMGB1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
