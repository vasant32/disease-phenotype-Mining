<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiopathogenesis of BD involves immunogenetics, infectious organisms (streptococcus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus), immunoregulation and vascular dysfunctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously found that immunoregulation associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was important to the development of BD-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that Th2 cytokines up-regulated by Th2 adjuvant were efficient in attenuating or improving these BD-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to directly augment IL-4 expression, a DNA vector (pCIN-mIL-4) was administered to BD-like mice using the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30217">Helios</z:chebi> gene gun system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two injections of the pCIN-mIL-4 vector, spread over 2 weeks, attenuated or improved the mucocutaneous symptoms of 10 out of 12 BD-like mice in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improved mucocutaneous symptoms were crust in face, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in mouth, scruff, back, genital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This improvement also correlated with induction of IL-4 mRNA in lymph nodes, protein in serum and intracellular IL-4 staining in splenocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> control mice (n = 10) injected with the pCIN-mIL-4 vector expressed IL-4 mRNA and showed more splenocytes stained with anti-IL-4 antibody (5.77 +/- 0.92%) than did mice injected with the pCIN control vector (3.34 +/- 0.25%; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that an IL-4 DNA vector could be used to express <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in vivo and further suggest that such an IL-4 DNA vector could be used as a therapeutic treatment in recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> shifted to T helper type 1 cytokine production </plain></SENT>
