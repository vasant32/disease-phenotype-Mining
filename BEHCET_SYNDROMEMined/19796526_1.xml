<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated MBL2 gene polymorphisms and serum MBL levels in BD patients and controls.METHODS: MBL2 gene polymorphisms in exon 1 (MBL2 54 Gly/Asp, (A/B)), promoter (MBL2 H/L (G-550C), MBL2 Y/X (G-221C)), and 5' UTR region (MBL2 P/Q (C+4T)) were investigated using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism in 119 BD patients and 252 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum MBL levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 49 BD patients and 102 sex-/genotype-matched controls.RESULTS: No significant difference was found between BD patients and controls in terms of MBL2 polymorphisms and MBL serum levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and neurologic involvement were found to be associated with MBL2 54 allele A (OR=2.415, OR=6.632, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eye involvement was found to be related to the presence of the MBL2 54 AA or AB genotypes (OR=12.46), MBL2-G-550C allele H (OR=1.829) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High serum MBL level (&gt; or =500 ng/ml) was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> (p=0.002).CONCLUSION: The frequencies of the four MBL2 genetic polymorphisms examined were not different in BD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, eye involvement, and neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were found to be associated with MBL2 polymorphisms that are associated with the production of high levels of MBL or functional MBL </plain></SENT>
