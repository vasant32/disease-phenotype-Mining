<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 137 Italian patients (76 males and 61 females, age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 29.6 +/- 12.2 [mean +/- SD] years) seen consecutively in nine different referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The duration of follow-up at study entry was 10.9 +/- 8.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients fulfilled the classification criteria developed by the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of the patients were recorded by the attending physicians using specifically designed forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most frequent manifestations at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were oral (78.3%) and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> (29.2%) followed by inflammatory ocular involvement (20%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (14.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The commonest (&gt;50% of cases) manifestations observed throughout the disease course were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral aphthae</z:e> (99.3%), genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> (62.8%), various cutaneous lesions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (81.8%), and inflammatory ocular disease (60.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>Panuveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035333" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retinitis</z:e> occurred more frequently in males compared with females (28.9% versus 11.5% and 57.9% versus 36.1%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>61.6% of our patients were HLA-B51 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in Italian patients is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations in agreement with the medical literature </plain></SENT>
