<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: This study was conducted on 24 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome who had active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, ten of whom showed isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> classified as idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and 13 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-10 in sera and supernatants of PBMC cultures stimulated by PHA were estimated using immunoenzymatic dosage (ELISA sandwich according to the methods recommended by Immunotech France) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The production of NO was measured in vivo and in vitro for the same patients using the modified Griess method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The induction of IFN-gamma and IL-12 was higher in the two groups of patients than in the controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant IL-10 levels were recorded in 56.5% of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> versus 30% of patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NO production was more pronounced in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> than in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The predominance of the Th1 profile was associated with high production of NO in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A Th1/Th2 profile with a moderated increase in NO production was observed in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data have a clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observation of combined Th1/Th2 cytokines and NO elevation in both in vivo an in vitro experiments could have a predictive value in characterizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
