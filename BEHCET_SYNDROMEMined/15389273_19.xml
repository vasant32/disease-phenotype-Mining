<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An open-label clinical trial including seven patients (12 eyes) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> refractory to conventional treatment regimens with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and at least one <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three intravenous doses of 5 mg/kg of infliximab were administered at weeks 0, 2, and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infliximab infusion was repeated in patients undergoing a relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> after initial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Improvement was defined as amelioration of visual acuity or disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001147'>retinal exudates</z:hpo> and/or haemorrhages, decreased macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> and/or vitreous opacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up for at least 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the seven patients (five diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease and one diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e>) showed a significant improvement after the first infliximab dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only in one patient diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> idiopathic multifocal <z:mp ids='MP_0001848'>choroiditis</z:mp> did the drug have no effect, and this patient was withdrawn from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of follow-up, <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> had lost one line of vision and three eyes showed improved vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eyes had improved in terms of signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects of treatment were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab is efficient and safe for the long-term management of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, especially in patients with predominant <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
