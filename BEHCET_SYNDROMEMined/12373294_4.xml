<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> (major histocompatibility complex MHC class I chain-related genes) polymorphisms in an Italian series of patients with juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (jBD) and to compare these genetic findings with the high prevalence of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucosal disease</z:e>, which occurs in Western populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten families which included at least 1 affected patient were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 18 patients (13 children and 5 adults) affected with the complete or incomplete form of jBD comparing the results to those found in a population of 20 apparently healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> transmembrane polymorphism was analysed by PCR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA typing was assessed by SSP-PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using chi2 based methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017178" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gastrointestinal disease</z:e> was high (41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of 10 patients were HLA-B51 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> A6 allele was present in 70% of probands as compared to 25% of an ethnically matched control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> A5.1 was present in 20% of probands as compared to 60% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Out of 5 A6 homozygotes, 2 probands and 2 affected relatives developed a severe gut <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> gene polymorphisms disclosed an independent association with genetic risk for jBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> A6 and HLA-B51 is the strongest genetic marker for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Homozygous A6 patients seem to develop more severe mucosal gut involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This finding sheds light on the role of a receptor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>, named NKG2D, presented by natural killer cells, and CD8+, alphabetaT cells and gammadeltaT cells, usually localised in gut mucosa </plain></SENT>
