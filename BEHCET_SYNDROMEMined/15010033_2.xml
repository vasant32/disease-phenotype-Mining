<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and its satellite offices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Female patients who have never been sexually active or abused who presented with the diagnosis of vulvar ulcerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: None </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Description of clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients who developed vulvar ulcerations and denied sexual contact or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282350" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sexual abuse</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of nine were premenarchal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine had negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herpes Simplex</z:e> Virus (HSV) cultures from the lesions, and three had negative HSV serology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Negative Epstein Barr virus (EBV) tests were documented in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesions were recurrent in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> was considered in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients had systemic complaints consistent with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> syndrome at the time of the vulvar ulcerations, but no definite etiology could be documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rare finding of a vulvar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in a sexually inexperienced patient can result in a diagnostic dilemma in the absence of signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> could be a local manifestation of a non-sexually transmitted systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> that has yet to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The occurrence in premenarchal females suggests the possibility of mediating hormonal factors </plain></SENT>
