<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PMN activities of myeloperoxidase (p &lt; 0.02), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (p &lt; 0.001), catalase (p &lt; 0.005), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (p &lt; 0.005) were significantly lower in the patients: the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase activity was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of ceruloplasmin (Cp), fibrinogen, and copper (Cu) were also significantly higher in the patients group (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant and positive correlations were found between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase and catalase activities (p &lt; 0.001) and also between the plasma Cp and Cu levels (p &lt; 0.001) in the patients group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation was observed among the other enzyme activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the control group, a significantly positive correlation was present only between the plasma ceruloplasmin and Cu levels (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that (impaired PMN functions) decreased enzyme activities in the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system and increased levels of oxygen free radicals may play a role in tissue damage in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
