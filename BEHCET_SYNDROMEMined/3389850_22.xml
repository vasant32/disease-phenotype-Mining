<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the relationship of the two diseases, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing was performed on 28 patients with SS and 49 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 28 patients with SS, seven had BD symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of both HLA-B51 and -DQw3 were significantly higher in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of the two HLA antigens in the 28 patients with SS and the 21 patients with SS without BD symptoms were not significantly different from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HLA-Bw54 was significantly increased in both groups of patients with SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate that SS is a genetically distinct disease entity from BD, although their symptoms are similar and the incidence of SS among patients with BD is high in Japan </plain></SENT>
