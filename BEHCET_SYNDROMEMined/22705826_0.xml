<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infectious agents, immune system mechanisms, and genetic factors are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of BD, which remains to be explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human MDR1 (ABCB1) gene encoder P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (P-gp) plays a key role in drug disposition, serves as a protective mechanism against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi>, and provides additional protection for the brain, testis, and fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the genotype and haplotype distributions of three MDR1 gene polymorphisms (C1236T, G2677T/A, and C3435T) in 104 BD patients and 130 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genotyping analysis was performed by using PCR-RFLP methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found for the genotypic and allelic distributions of three individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MDR1 gene between BD patients and control subjects in this study (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, combined genotype and haplotype frequencies have found statistically significant differences between BD and control subjects for some combinations (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CC-GG binary genotype for C1236T-G2677T/A loci couple in particular may have a high degree of predisposition to BD (p=0.009; OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.41-6.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant differences between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-responsive and -nonresponsive groups were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotypic and allelic distributions of C3435T and G2677T/A loci, as well as their genotype and haplotype combinations, were found to have statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The TT genotype for the C3435T locus (p=0.001; OR, 6.59; 95% CI, 1.86-23.30) and T allele (p=0.009; OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.18-3.70) plays a substantial role in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that MDR1 genes and their polymorphisms may affect a patient's BD susceptibility and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
