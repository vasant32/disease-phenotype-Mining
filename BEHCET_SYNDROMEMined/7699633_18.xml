<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with active BD, 10 patients with recurrent aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, 5 patients with noninflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> and 15 healthy individuals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three monoclonal antibodies TCR delta 1, BB3, and A13 were used to assess the percentage of TCR gamma delta+ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in bronchoalveolar lavage and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD11a/CD18 was used to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCR gamma delta+ cells isolated by immunomagnetic separation were tested for cytolytic activity against K562 target cells after interleukin 2 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PBMC TCR gamma delta BB3+ subset was significantly increased in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BD inflammatory sites, TCR gamma delta+ cells were also present, composed mainly of A13+ cells from these sites also expressed CD11a marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCR gamma delta+ cells from inflammatory sites displayed a higher cytotoxic activity than controls, mediated by the A13+ subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The accumulation of cytotoxic TCR gamma delta+ cells at the sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> suggests their involvement in the local injury process </plain></SENT>
