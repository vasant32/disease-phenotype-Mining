<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell (Treg) population, which plays important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> is related to the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two patients with BD (20 patients in active disease) fulfilling the criteria of the International Study Group of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty age-matched healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed CD4+CD25+/high T cells and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of Foxp3, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied the ability of CD4+CD25+ (Treg) to regulate proliferation of CD4+CD25- T cells during active BD stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Active BD patients had significantly higher CD4+CD25+/high T cells, as compared with BD in the remission stage, and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant differences in the CD4+ CD25+/high T cells expression between healthy controls and remission BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In active BD, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) were highly expressed when compared to remission BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no differences in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for TGF-beta in active BD, remission BD and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functionally, CD4+CD25+/high T cells in active BD were impaired in their proliferative responses and could suppress the proliferation of their CD4+CD25- counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that CD4+CD25+ Treg cells, with the potential to regulate suppression of effector T cells, were increased in the peripheral circulation of active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of CD4+CD25+/high T cells in the regulatory process of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in active BD, could be taken in account </plain></SENT>
