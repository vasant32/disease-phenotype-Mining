<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vimentin type of anti-IF was found to be positive in 14 out of 30 patients with BD (47%), whereas it was positive in 35% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (20 cases), 16% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (19 cases) and in only 9% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anti-IF were predominantly IgG class and the titers in BD were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of the 14 patients with anti-IF, 10 showed significantly increased levels of serum C9 and 8 showed increased levels of CRP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one patient showed increased C9, but was negative for anti-IF and CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of anti-IF in the patients' sera was found to be a more sensitive indicator, though not specific, for the clinical assessment of disease activity </plain></SENT>
