<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the right ventricle, patients with BD had lower early diastolic tricuspid annular velocity and early diastolic/late diastolic tricuspid annular velocity ratios than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mitral and tricuspid annular systolic velocities did not significantly differ; however, diastolic velocities were correlated with duration of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, early/late diastolic mitral annular velocity ratio and early/late diastolic tricuspid annular velocity ratios showed an inverse relation with ocular involvement, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, and CRP levels in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
