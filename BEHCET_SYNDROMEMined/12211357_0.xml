<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Audiovestibular symptoms may occur in isolation or may be mediated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in patients affected by systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (SNHL) is typical in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cogan's syndrome</z:e> but occurs less frequently in Be√ßhet's syndrome and in systemic necrotizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients affected by immune-mediated profound SNHL represent ideal candidates for cochlear implantation as these patients become deaf after years of hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease itself and the medication taken may, however, influence the prognosis of cochlear implantation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the pre- and intraoperative findings as well as the postoperative course and performance of a group of five patients affected by a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> syndrome who received a cochlear implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Implantation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, no complications occurred and excellent postoperative speech perception was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cochlear implantation in patients affected by immune-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inner ear disorders</z:e> is effective although the long-term results remain to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
