<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020641" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypopyon</z:e> consists of inflammatory cells infiltrating the eye, with polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) as the main component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to investigate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> property of PMNs in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PMNs were purified from peripheral blood cells of BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in the active or remission phase and were cultured for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some cultures, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS), antagonistic anti-TNFalpha antibody, agonistic anti-Fas antibody, or Fas:Fc fusion protein was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of cultures, apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin V expression using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of PMNs showed lower levels in the remission phase of BD-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> compared with the active phase or healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lower level of PMN <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the remission phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD remained even by stimulation with LPS, anti-TNFalpha antibody, or Fas:Fc fusion protein, which was abolished in the presence of agonistic anti-Fas antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In BD patients, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of PMNs was reduced in the remission phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and restored in the active phase, which arose from the apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in part via Fas-Fas ligand interaction </plain></SENT>
