<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop a standardized composite index (CI) to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> activity in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 121 patients with BD and 45 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percentage of BD and 68.9% of <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> patients were in active stage during the previous 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The developed CI included the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>-related pain and functional status and was evaluated in patients with both active and inactive disease for content validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Composite index score was observed to be higher in active patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (6.94 + or - 2.19) compared with active BD patients (6.01 + or - 2.04) (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were significantly higher in <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> compared with BD (P = 0.018, P = 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CI score correlated with the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in both BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> (P = 0.000, P = 0.002 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CI score was '0' for inactive patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: The presented CI as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> activity index seems to be a reliable and suitable tool for evaluating the clinical impact and disease-specific problems in BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
