<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Heart-rate recovery after exercise can provide both an estimate of impaired parasympathetic tone and a prognosis in regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate heart-rate recovery in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From January through July 2008, we examined at our outpatient clinic and prospectively enrolled 30 consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 50 healthy control participants who were matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basal electrocardiography, echocardiography, and treadmill exercise testing were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and control participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heart-rate recovery index was calculated in the usual manner, by subtracting the 1st-minute (Rec1), 2nd-minute (Rec2), and 3rd-minute (Rec3) recovery heart rates from the maximal heart rate after exercise stress testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease exhibited significantly lower heart-rate recovery numbers, compared with healthy control participants: Rec1, 24.28 +/- 8.2 vs 34.4 +/- 7.6, P = 0.002; Rec2, 49.28 +/- 11.2 vs 57.5 +/- 7.0, P &lt; 0.05; and Rec3, 56.2 +/- 12.11 vs 67.4 +/- 8.7, P = 0.014 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the 1st study that shows an impaired heart-rate recovery index (indicative of reduced parasympathetic activity) among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the independent prognostic value of the heart-rate recovery index, our results may explain the increased occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001645'>sudden cardiac death</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this index may be clinically useful in the identification of high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
