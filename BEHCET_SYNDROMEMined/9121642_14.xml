<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 17 patients (14 men, 3 women) with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease using T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images and contrast-enhanced images at 0.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 13 patients (76.5%) who had single or multiple lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of these were in the basal ganglia, brain stem or deep white matter region, giving high signal on T2-weighted images and isointense or low signal on T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases (17.6%) there was linear high signal along the posterior limb of the internal capsule on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was considered as a potential differentiating feature of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhancement was seen in 17 lesions in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
