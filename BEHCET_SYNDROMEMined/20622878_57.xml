<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a genome-wide association study with 311,459 SNPs in 1,215 individuals with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (cases) and 1,278 healthy controls from Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the known association of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with HLA-B*51 and identified a second, independent association within the MHC Class I region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also identified an association at IL10 (rs1518111, P = 1.88 x 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a meta-analysis with an additional five cohorts from Turkey, the Middle East, Europe and Asia, comprising a total of 2,430 cases and 2,660 controls, we identified associations at IL10 (rs1518111, P = 3.54 x 10(-18), odds ratio = 1.45, 95% CI 1.34-1.58) and the IL23R-IL12RB2 locus (rs924080, P = 6.69 x 10(-9), OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease-associated IL10 variant (the rs1518111 A allele) was associated with diminished <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression and low protein production </plain></SENT>
