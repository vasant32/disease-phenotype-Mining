<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 18 eyes of 15 consecutive patients with BD who received an IVTA injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The indication for an IVTA injection was severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> attacks in 15 patients who were unresponsive or intolerant to systemic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> resolved after a mean period of 25 days following the IVTA injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean followup period of 28 months (range, 9-50), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes showed improvement in visual acuity (mean, 0.71 logMAR units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve (12) eyes (66.6%) had an elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>Cataract</z:hpo> progression or new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> formation was detected in 10 eyes (55.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four (4) eyes (22%) had relapses 10-28 months (mean, 19) after the IVTA injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The IVTA injection may be used as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> attacks in patients with BD who are unresponsive or intolerant to systemic medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although it hastens the resolution of attacks and seems to have a long-term, anti-inflammatory effect, relapses can occur in the long term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is also associated with a high rate of IOP elevation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> progression in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
