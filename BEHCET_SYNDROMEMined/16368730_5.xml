<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> may arise in conjunction with such complications but also appears to occur independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to define the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in an unselected group of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, to characterize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> syndromes and to identify what treatments are being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to an unselected group of patients through their support group newsletter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed a prevalence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in 82.5% of responders; the majority exhibited symptoms that fulfilled the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Society criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, with a higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> prevalence of visual or sensory aura of 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>Migraine</z:hpo> Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score for disability in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, 62% of responders showed moderate or severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> treatment was poor, the majority of sufferers resorting to over-the-counter remedies; preventative treatments had rarely been prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is very common in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, is poorly treated and is associated with disablement </plain></SENT>
