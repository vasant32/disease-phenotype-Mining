<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and retrosternal pain) were gradually relieved by treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and total parenteral nutrition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, about one month later, oral and <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcers</z:mp> appeared again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">Mesalazine</z:chebi> was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral and <z:mp ids='MP_0004547'>esophageal ulcers</z:mp> healed promptly, and have not relapsed for about one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> appears to act locally in the small intestine and colon, the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> in this case may be explained by the systemic antiinflammatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> is an effective drug and is a good candidate in the treatment of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, especially accompanied with esophageal involvement </plain></SENT>
