<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms were refractory to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1999, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was noticed in this patient for the first time, and in 2000, her white blood cell count decreased to 0.94x10(9)/l with 1% myeloblasts and 24% neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination showed mild hypocellularity with 8% myeloblasts and 6% mature neutrophils with dysplastic features </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, the BD symptoms continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> worsened to 0.24x10(9)/l with 21% neutrophils, the patient underwent cord blood transplantation (CBT) from an unrelated donor in July 2001 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which encompasses CBT, may be an effective therapy in patients with high-risk aggressive BD </plain></SENT>
