<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was made of 70 Japanese patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who were seen during a 23-year period from 1974 to 1996 and followed for five or more years at Okayama University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 70 patients were divided into three groups: 36 patients with recurrent episodes of eye involvement; 13 patients with non-recurrent one-time only eye involvement; and 21 patients with no eye involvement at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> during a follow-up period of five or more years </plain></SENT>
