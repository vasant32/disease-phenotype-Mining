<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological pictures of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system were characterized as follows: the site of predilection was the brain stem, followed by the spinal cord, cerebrum and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathognomonic changes were recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammations</z:mp> around small vessels, causing a softening of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were composed of a perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, histiocytes and microglias and, moreover, diapedesis, degenerated nerve cells and oligodendroglias, glial nodule, breakdown of myelin and axon, fatty granule cells and glio-mesenchymal proliferation were present occasionally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic studies on the neurons revealed no evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> particles except for some accumulations of electron dense bodies </plain></SENT>
