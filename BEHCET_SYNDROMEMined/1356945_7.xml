<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our NcoI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in the TNF-beta gene, the frequency of the NcoI 5.5 kb homozygote was decreased considerably in the patients, especially those with the ocular lesions, in relation to the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed between these groups in the EcoRI RFLP band distribution in this gene or the in susceptibility to lysis by alloreactive NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that a non-HLA gene located around the TNF gene region centromic of the HLA-B gene was a candidate to control the genetic susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
