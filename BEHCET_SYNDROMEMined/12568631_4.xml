<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated the efficacy of rebamipide, a gastroprotective drug, against oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 35 patients with BD, having as the main symptom oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e>, were randomised to receive rebamipide 300 mg/day or placebo for 12 to 24 weeks between August 1994 and December 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> must have occurred within 4 weeks prior to enrolment and must have been visible for at least 7 days during that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oral aphthae</z:e> count and pain scores were recorded daily in a diary by the patients themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monthly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain scores were defined as the sum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain scores for a month, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Investigators rated the global improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain using a 6-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of change in monthly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain scores in the first 3 and last 3 months of treatment were assessed in patients with more severe symptoms whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain score were &gt;28 at baseline (trial entry) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate of moderate or marked improvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain was 36% (5 of 14 subjects) in the placebo group and 65% (11 of 17 subjects) in the rebamipide group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During months 2 to 6 of treatment, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count tended to increase and reached a peak at month 4 in the placebo group but decreased in the rebamipide group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pain score decreased to the same extent in both groups for the first 3 months of treatment; however, in the fourth to sixth months of treatment, the pain score tended to increase in the placebo group but decreased in the rebamipide group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with a monthly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> pain score &gt;28 at baseline, pain and count scores decreased throughout the 6 months of rebamipide treatment but increased during the last 3 months of treatment in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.01 for the between-group comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rebamipide is well tolerated and improves the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> count and pain score in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It may therefore be useful in the treatment and prevention of frequently recurrent oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (not restricted to BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Administration of rebamipide is not cumbersome, and it does not cause any discomfort, which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> ointments for example may do; furthermore, there are no specific adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rebamipide is therefore recommended as a long-term treatment for recurrent oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
