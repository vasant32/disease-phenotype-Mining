<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To acquire the image of the fovea during remission of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and to further assess the correlation between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and SD-OCT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 24 eyes of 14 patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were examined with SD-OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationships between BCVA and other clinical characteristics, including foveal thickness and status of external limiting membrane (ELM) or the junction between photoreceptor inner and outer segments (IS/OS), were analysed for statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BCVA in eyes with intact IS/OS was significantly better than that in eyes with ill-defined IS/OS (P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Foveal thickness (P=0.0001) and male sex (P=0.03) were also significantly different between eyes with and without complete IS/OS line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Definition of the IS/OS line by SD-OCT, but not status of the ELM line, appears to be associated with BCVA in patients with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, SD-OCT may prove useful in the evaluation of visual function after ocular attacks of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
