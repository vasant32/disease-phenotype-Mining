<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this ongoing, prospective, longitudinal and observational study, data were collected on efficacy and safety of every patient with BD beginning anti-TNF therapy in the last 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present analysis was restricted to patients who were switched to adalimumab after failing or not tolerating infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 69 patients with BD have been treated with infliximab so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of these (25%) have been switched to adalimumab for lack or loss of efficacy or infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 10 out of these 17, the main manifestations requiring switching were the mucocutaneous lesions, in 4 retinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and in 3 the neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 treated patients, 9 showed sustained remission of the disease and 3 a good response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that patients with BD showing a scarce response or adverse events to infliximab may successfully be treated with adalimumab, regardless of the reason for switching </plain></SENT>
