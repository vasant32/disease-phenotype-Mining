<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The interferon (IFN) and oligo-2',5'-adenylate (2-5A) systems were investigated in endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that oligo-2',5'-adenylate synthetase (2-5AS) activities of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (P less than 0.01), Vogt-Koyanagi-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> (VKH disease, P less than 0.01), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> (P less than 0.01) compared with those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (Cy A) on IFN systems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, 2-5AS activities of PBL from 2 patients under Cy A therapy (10 mg/kg/day) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The enzyme activities were high before treatment in both patients, but the activities were suppressed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of Cy A on the production of IFN by PBL in vitro was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN synthesis was markedly suppressed by Cy A in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> on IFN and 2-5A systems in VKH disease was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were given 200 mg of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> with gradual tapering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activities of 2-5AS of PBL from patients were high before treatment, and they were markedly suppressed after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum IFN, 2-5AS activities of PBL and the synthesis of IFN in vitro were examined in one patient who was given pulse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The serum IFN and 2-5AS activity of PBL were suppressed by this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The production of IFN-alpha induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus and IFN-gamma induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin A and OK-432 were greatly suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the IFN and 2-5A systems in endogenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> play some significant role in the immunopathophysiology of these diseases </plain></SENT>
