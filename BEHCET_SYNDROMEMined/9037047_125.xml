<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A member of a novel family of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes termed MIC (MHC class I chain-related genes), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>, has been recently identified near the HLA-B gene on the short arm of human chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predicted amino acid sequence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> chain suggests that it folds similarly to typical class I chains and may have the capacity to bind <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> or other short ligands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> is predicted to have a specialized function in antigen presentation or T cell recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During nucleotide sequence analyses of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> genomic clone, we found a triplet repeat microsatellite polymorphism of (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/AGC)n in the transmembrane (TM) region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 68 HLA homozygous B cell lines, 5 distinct alleles of this microsatellite sequence were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of them contained an additional one base insertion that created a frameshift mutation resulting in a premature termination codon in the TM region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This particular allele may encode a soluble, secreted form of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have investigated this microsatellite polymorphism in 77 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e>, which is known to be associated with HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The microsatellite allele consisting of 6 repetitions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/AGC was present at significantly higher frequency in the patient group (Pc = 0.00055) than in a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCT</z:e>/AGC)6 allele was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B51 positive patients and in an additional 13 B51 negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the possibility of a primary association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> rather than HLA-B </plain></SENT>
