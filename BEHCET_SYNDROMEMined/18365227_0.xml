<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 25 healthy volunteers were evaluated for pure tone audiometry, caloric response, and VEMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was found in 53.8% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, which was significantly higher than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, but no controls; this difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although VEMP recordings were elicited in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects, mean p13 and n23 latencies were prolonged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had delayed VEMP responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no correlations regarding p13 values and age, duration or activity of disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this preliminary study suggest an association between delayed VEMP responses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further research with large samples is needed to confirm that VEMP testing is useful to diagnose and follow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001751'>vestibular dysfunction</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
