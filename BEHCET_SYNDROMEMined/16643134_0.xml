<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients with BD and 15 healthy controls were recruited to the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was investigated by the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BD patients displayed an enhanced rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> compared to healthy controls (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The insulin sensitivity (M), measured as the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization rate under steady-state conditions of euglycaemia, was significantly decreased (P = 0.001) in BD patients compared to the controls (4.09 +/- 0.16 vs. 5.60 +/- 0.27 mg/kg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The C-reactive protein (CRP) level, but not the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), was significantly related to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (CRP: r(s) = 0.589, P = 0.27; ESR: r(s) = 0444, P = 0112), whereas no relationship was found between the M-value and ESR or CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with BD exhibit peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>; this could be explained as the diverse consequences of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> in BD </plain></SENT>
