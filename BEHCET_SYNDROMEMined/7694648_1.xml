<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice sensitized with inactivated S. sanguis organisms antigen-injected at the base of the tail developed footpad swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those with an I-Ak,q,r region of H-2 showed a strong footpad response, whereas those with an I-Ab,d,s region showed a weak response to S. sanguis cell wall antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Footpad response was mediated by CD4+,8- T cells by using in vitro monoclonal antibody treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar evidence of genetic control was obtained with an in vitro T cell proliferation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, quantitation of antibodies against S. sanguis showed that antibody production was not controlled by H-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that both in vivo footpad swelling and in vitro T cell proliferation responses were functions of helper (CD3+,4+,8-) T cells and controlled by the I-A region of H-2 </plain></SENT>
