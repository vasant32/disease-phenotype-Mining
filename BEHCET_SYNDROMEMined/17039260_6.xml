<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) protein gene polymorphism is one of the factors implicated in the pathogenesis of AA type <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to investigate SAA1 gene polymorphism in different patient groups: (1) BD related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, (2) BD without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, and (3) healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred eleven patients from three main groups were included in the study: (1) BD related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (n = 9), (2) BD without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (n = 39), and (3) healthy controls (n = 63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous alpha/alpha is present in 78% of patients with BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SAA1 alpha/alpha genotype is significantly more common among patients with BD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated increased frequency of alpha/alpha genotype in BD related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the relationship between alpha/alpha genotype and BD related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> was not studied previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the SAA1 alpha/alpha genotype is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in BD </plain></SENT>
