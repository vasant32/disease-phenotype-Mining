<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to recent evidence for <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> deficiency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e>, this study is to evaluate the correlation of serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: This case-control study was conducted on 46 BD patients and 46 healthy controls in a rheumatology research centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The case and control groups were both age- and race-matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level was then measured by atomic absorption spectrometry Shimadzu AA-680 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average serum levels of both groups were then compared and analyzed using t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> levels of patients appeared to be 66.4 ± 15.38 μg/L which was significantly lower than that in the healthy controls (86.87 ± 17.18 μg/L) (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taking physician global assessment of disease activity into account, significant difference was detected between the patients with active disease (66.57 ± 15.21 μg/L) and those in the inactive state (65.83 ± .75 μg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the findings mentioned above, serum <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> level was meaningfully elevated among the patients with ocular involvement (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="27568">selenium</z:chebi> serum level among BD patients was lower than that in healthy controls, whereas among the patients with ocular involvement it was higher than those not involved </plain></SENT>
