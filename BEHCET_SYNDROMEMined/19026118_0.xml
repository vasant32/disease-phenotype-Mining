<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Serum levels of the B-cell activating factor in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor family (BAFF), a potent contributor to B-cell survival, are elevated in patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine serum BAFF levels and to link the results to the clinical features in patients with skin manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum BAFF levels were examined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 42 patients with BD (16 with active disease), 20 healthy controls, and in 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) and 15 patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS), who served as the disease control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of BAFF <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) in the skin was quantified by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; the expression of BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) on CD19+ B cells was assessed by flow cytometry; and ELISA was used to evaluate the production of IgG, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 by isolated B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum BAFF levels were elevated in patients with active BD compared to the healthy controls, and correlated positively with the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease remission was accompanied by decreased BAFF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SLE patients had the highest serum BAFF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsies showed BAFF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression to be up-regulated in active BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BAFF-R expression on B cells was increased in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in BD patients the ability to produce IgG and IL-6 (but not IL-10) was enhanced in BAFF-stimulated B lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BAFF and its signalling in B cells contribute to B cell abnormalities and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
