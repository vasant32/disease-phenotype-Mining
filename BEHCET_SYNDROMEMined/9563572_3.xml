<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), slot blot and Southern blot hybridization, direct sequencing and in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) to show the possible presence of EBV-DNA in pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions of patients with recurrent aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (RAU) or <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, formalin-fixed biopsy specimens were obtained from 13 pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions of nine RAU and four BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five specimens of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oral mucosa (NOM) from five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and 10 specimens of oral erosive or ulcerative lesions from 10 patients with erosive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lichen planus</z:e> (ELP) were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EBV-DNA was detected by PCR in 5 of the 13 (38.5%) pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions, two from RAU patients and three from BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no EBV-DNA was demonstrated in five NOM specimens from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and in 10 specimens of oral lesions from ELP patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-DNA was also demonstrated in patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes and/or plasma, suggesting that the lymphocytes may be the reservoir of latent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">EBV infection</z:e> and there is EBV shedding in the plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EBV-DNA was detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> in only one PCR-positive case; the reaction product was found to deposit on the nuclei of some of the epithelial cells and lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By immunohistochemistry, expression of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen and EBV/C3d receptors was also noted in some of the epithelial cells and lymphocytes in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>-positive case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that the epithelial cells of pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions may be infected by EBV through EBV-infected lymphocytes; also, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-induced lysis of the EBV-infected epithelial cells, but not the virus-induced cytolysis, may be the main mechanism causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data provide preliminary evidence for an association of EBV with pre-ulcerative oral aphthous lesions in RAU and BD patients </plain></SENT>
