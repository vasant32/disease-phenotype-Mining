<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We previously showed that Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (A-BD) is associated with a lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been shown to play a role in cartilage regeneration and is increased in patients with A-BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also found 2 functional polymorphisms of the TGF-beta pathway, TGFBR1*6A and TGFB1*CC, that are associated with risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested whether incidence of these polymorphisms would differ in patients with A-BD compared with healthy controls of similar age and geographic location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study including 139 cases and 128 controls from Greece </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were genotyped for TGFBR1*6A and TGFB1*CC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that cases had lower incidence of TGFBR1*6A compared with controls (11.3% vs 13.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the incidence of TGFB1*CC was lower in cases than controls (24.6% vs 27.0%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there is a suggestion that the lower incidence of TGFBR1*6A in A-BD patients may play a protective role against development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, larger studies would be needed to fully evaluate the role of TGF-beta and its polymorphisms in A-BD </plain></SENT>
