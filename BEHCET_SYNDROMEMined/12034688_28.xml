<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors aimed to detect serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy), ET-1, and NO in BD and to assess if tHcy, ET-1, and NO are associated with ocular BD or disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 43 consecutive patients with ocular (n = 27) or non-ocular (n = 16) BD (36.95 (SD 9.80) years, 22 male, 21 female) satisfying international criteria, and 25 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (37.88 (8.73) years, 13 male, 12 female) without a history of systemic or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined by two ophthalmologists with an interest in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum tHcy, ET-1, and NO concentrations were measured in both groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall mean serum tHcy, ET-1, and NO levels were significantly higher in patients with BD than in control subjects (tHcy = 15.83 (4.44) v 7.96 (2.66) ng/ml, p &lt;0.001; ET-1 = 17.47 (4.33) v 5.74 (2.34) micromol/ml, p &lt;0.001; NO = 37.60 (10.31) v 27.08 (7.76) micromol/l, p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum tHcy, ET-1, and NO levels were significantly higher in active patients than in inactive patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, among patients with ocular BD, the mean tHcy levels were significantly increased and correlated with ET-1 and NO levels when compared with non-ocular disease and control subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated tHcy may be responsible for the endothelial damage in BD and may be an additional risk factor for the development of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular occlusive disease, contributing to the poor visual outcome in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Assessment of tHcy may be important in the investigation and management of patients with BD, especially with ocular disease </plain></SENT>
