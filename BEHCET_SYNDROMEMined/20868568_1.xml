<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the reactivity of sera from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> (DM), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (TA) patients against human α-enolase and streptococcal α-enolase, and identified additional streptococcal antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting were performed using sera from patients with BD, SLE, DM, RA, and TA and healthy volunteers (control) against human α-enolase and streptococcal α-enolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to identify and recombine other streptococcal antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Specific positive signals against recombinant human α-enolase were detected by IgM ELISA of serum samples from 50% of BD, 14.3% of SLE, 57.1% of DM, 42.9% of RA, and 57.1% of TA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific positive signals against streptococcal α-enolase were detected from 42.9% of BD, 14.3% of DM, and 14.3% of TA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No SLE and RA sera reacted against streptococcal α-enolase antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Streptococcal proteins reacting with sera were identified as hypothetical protein (HP) for SLE and DM patients, acid phosphatase (AP) for RA patients, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (GAPDH) for TA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed that RA patients did not present serum reactivity against either HP or GAPDH though BD, SLE, DM, and TA patients did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, AP reacted with sera from BD, SLE, DM, RA, and TA patients </plain></SENT>
