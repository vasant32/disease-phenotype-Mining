<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was planned to explore the alterations of endothelial functions in the prethrombotic state of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Plasma levels of endothelial secretory markers, in vivo molecular haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters were cross-sectionally determined in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND SUBJECTS: In our tertiary referral centre, 30 (13 men, 17 women) BD patients, mean age 31 +/- 7 years, and 15 (eight men, seven women) healthy volunteers, mean age 26 +/- 9 years, were eligible for inclusion in the study after obtaining their written consents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> plasma samples for the assays of haemostatic parameters were obtained before and after an endothelial stimulant, desmopressin <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (DDAVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have shown that in the procoagulant phase of BD patients: (1) basal thrombomodulin concentrations are increased and could not be provoked by DDAVP infusion; (2) both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> and 6-keto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> increments occur concurrently; (3) in vivo coagulation markers are elevated and raised plasmin-alpha 2 antiplasmin complex indicates a subclinical concomitant fibrinolysis; (4) the fibrinolytic process is conveyed in a somewhat complex manner in which plasminogen activator binding kinetics might be also altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial cell injury, augmented thrombotic risk with compensatory excessive fibrinolysis and alterations in endothelial cell receptor-fibrinolytic marker relations might take place in the pathogenesis and thereby modulate the natural course of haemostatic processes of BD </plain></SENT>
