<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was based on 40 eyes of 34 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who underwent phacoemulsification <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> extraction and intraocular lens implantation between May 2000 and February 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their postoperative ocular complications and visual outcomes were observed during a mean follow-up period of 18.35 +/- 6.17 months (range, 6 to 32 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative visual acuity increased in 29 eyes (72.5%) and was 20/40 or better in 18 eyes (45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It decreased in 7 eyes (17.5%), resulting in a visual acuity of 20/400 or worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent postoperative complication was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444680" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">posterior capsular opacification</z:e>, which developed in 15 eyes (37.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other complications were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152253" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior synechiae</z:e> formation in 7 eyes (17.5%), severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in 5 eyes (12.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> in 5 eyes (12.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100014'>epiretinal membrane</z:hpo> in 3 eyes (7.5%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> in 2 eyes (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With appropriate preoperative and postoperative suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation are safe procedures leading to visual improvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease without preexisting fundus lesions </plain></SENT>
