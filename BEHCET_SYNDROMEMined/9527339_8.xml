<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with B- or C-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and ocular sight-threatening <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease unresponsive to steroids were treated subcutaneously with interferon alpha 3 x 10(6)/unit three times per week for a mean period of 22 months (range: 12-31 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The course of ocular and systemic lesions was recorded and compared with a similar pre-treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least a 50% reduction in the number of ocular relapses was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients (mean relapse/month: 0.41 versus 0.16 in the pre- and in-treatment period, respectively) while during therapy also each relapse lasted less in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reduction of steroid dependence was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, while no significant side-effects were related to interferon alpha administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients who tried to stop interferon alpha therapy showed after a mean period of 12.5 days a recurrence of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and, one of them experienced oral and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthae</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease interferon alpha seems to be a useful alternative therapy for sight-threatening ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
