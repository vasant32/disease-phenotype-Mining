<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> history was compared between both groups with age- and sex-matching and clinical manifestations of BD associated with high anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BD patients had more common history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>dental caries</z:hpo> than aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> patients (P = 0.002 and P = 0.043, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BD patients with persistently high anti-streptolysin O titers had more frequent history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 2.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-5.82) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (EN)-like lesions (P = 0.001, OR = 3.02, 95% CI 1.54-5.93) and fewer history of genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> (P = 0.027, OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.84) than BD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anti-streptolysin O titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest persistently high ASO titers in BD patients could indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal infections</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> are related to BD symptoms such as EN-like lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In these patients, ASO titer can be used in the evaluation of BD disease activity and antibiotic treatments might be effective to control the symptoms of BD </plain></SENT>
