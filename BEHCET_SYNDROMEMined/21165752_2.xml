<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied consecutive patients with relapsing--remitting or progressive neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> who referred from January 2002 to January 2009 to Nemazee Hospital, Shiraz, southern Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential MRIs were performed during clinical relapses in patients with relapsing--remitting course or during relentless progression after first referral of patients with progressive course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed 55 MRIs of 17 patients (ten men and seven women) with age of 36.4 ± 8.1 years at the time of first MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine (53%) patients had a relapsing-remitting course and eight (47%) had a progressive course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial and last follow-up studies had a mean interval of 29.2 months (range, 24 to 84) </plain></SENT>
