<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the pattern and site of involvement in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (NBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with NBD were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1-weighted axial and sagittal images, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhanced axial and coronal images and T2-weighted axial images were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The brainstem, basal ganglia, cerebral white matter, internal capsule, thalamus and spinal cord were involved in eighteen, nine, nine, seven, six and two patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine patients with cerebral white matter involvement, four had subcortical involvement and three had periventricular involvement, in addition to two patients with focal deep white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the brainstem lesions, pons involvement was seen in fourteen patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had ventrally located lesions, and nine had tegmental involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Midbrain involvement was seen in fourteen patients; the cerebral peduncle was involved in 11 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients had brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>: two cases were demonstrated at initial MRI, the other three cases were seen on follow-up MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pyramidal signs, the most common neurological signs, were demonstrated in fourteen patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI was obtained 10 days to 20 months after the initial MRI in eight cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed changes in size, shape and site of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement, thirteen patients demonstrated mottled non-confluent enhancement in the brainstem (eight patients), posterior limb of the internal capsule (three patients), pachymeninges (two patients) and spinal cord (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NBD manifests a reversible course, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> NBD may result in brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Characteristic involvement along the corticospinal tract is well correlated with neurological signs </plain></SENT>
