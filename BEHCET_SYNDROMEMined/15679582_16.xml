<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine a possible association of specific polymorphisms of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> genes with susceptibility for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 72 patients with BD and 163 healthy controls for IL-1alpha-889, IL-1beta-511, and +3953 (nt5887) single-nucleotide polymorphisms besides IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism (for five different alleles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the IL-1beta+3953 T allele and TT genotype frequencies showed a significant difference between patients with BD and controls (54.2 vs. 40.5%, OR = 1.74, P = 0.024, and 40.3 vs. 19.6%, OR = 2.76, P = 0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no difference was observed in the genotype or allele frequencies of IL-1alpha-889, IL-1beta-511, and IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> between the patients with BD and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that susceptibility to BD is increased in individuals carrying the IL-1beta+3953 T allele and TT genotype </plain></SENT>
