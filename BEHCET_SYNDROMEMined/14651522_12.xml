<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the genes encoding chemokines have been described as affecting chemokine production or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the frequency of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding CCL2 (-2518 and -2076) and CCL5 (-403 and -28) in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), a systemic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and patients with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (RV), an organ-specific form of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that there was no association between any SNP and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when segregated on the basis of gender the CCR5 -403 AA genotype was only found in male patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CCL2 genotypes 1/2 were predominant in males, while genotype 4 was significantly associated with disease in female patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences in disease symptoms and severity between males and females have been described in BD and gender-specific genetic differences in chemokine gene function may be involved </plain></SENT>
