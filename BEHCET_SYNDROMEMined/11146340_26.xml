<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Endothelial dysfunction</z:e> is one of the prominent features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adrenomedullin (AM) is a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> produced not only in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adrenal medulla but also in the vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, and its role in the course of BD has not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect changes of plasma AM concentrations in patients with BD compared with age- and sex-matched healthy subjects by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPCL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also investigated if disease activity or the duration of BD correlates with AM levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with BD (38.5 +/- 11.1 years, 19 male and 23 female) and 20 healthy age- and sex-matched control subjects (39.5 +/- 10.9 years, 8 male and 12 female) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma AM levels by HPCL, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reactants including alpha(1)-antitrypsin and alpha(2)-macroglobulin, neutrophil count and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- SD plasma AM levels in patients with BD (73.22 +/- 25.55 pmol/l) were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than in healthy control volunteers (21.35 +/- 12.37 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with active BD had similar plasma AM concentrations (79.32 +/- 21.89 pmol/l) with patients with inactive disease (67.44 +/- 29.92 pmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients with longer duration of the disease (mean duration, 13.9 +/- 3.8 years) had significantly higher plasma AM levels (83.99 +/- 19.71 pmol/l; p = 0.005) than patients (62.45 +/- 26.57 pmol/l) with shorter duration of the disease (mean duration, 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5 +/- 2.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase reaction parameters were found to be significantly increased in the active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering its endothelial cell implications, AM may be involved in reparatory vessel endothelium mechanisms, especially in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
