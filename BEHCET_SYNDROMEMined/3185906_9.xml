<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the serial CTs and clinical courses of five patients with neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and reviewed ten previously reported cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with focal CT abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CT lesions were in the brainstem (8 patients), basal ganglia (7), thalamus (4), or hemispheric white matter (7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients who received contrast, nine had lesions that showed enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five, lesions were visualized with contrast that were not apparent without it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CT lesions were usually accompanied by corresponding clinical deficits, although in some patients deficits were more extensive than the CT predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, contrast enhancement decreased or disappeared over days to weeks, often with associated clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In eight patients followed serially, CT abnormalities resolved completely or substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these cases, we conclude that (1) CT abnormalities of gray and white matter occur commonly in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with focal deficits, and help support the diagnosis; (2) CT abnormalities, particularly contrast enhancement, correlate well with the activity of parenchymal disease; and (3) the concomitant improvement of clinical and CT abnormalities with resolution of contrast enhancement suggests that partially reversible inflammatory changes associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier may produce some of the neurologic and radiographic deficits in this illness </plain></SENT>
