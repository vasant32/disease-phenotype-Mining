<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one BD patients from UK (F/M: 18/13, mean age: 41.8 +/- 11.5 years) and Turkey (F/M: 18/13, mean age: 41.5 +/- 10.3) who were matched according to age and gender were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral QoL was assessed by Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral health was evaluated by dental and periodontal indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was found in OHIP-14 scores between patients from UK (22.7 +/- 14.4) and Turkey (20.4 +/- 14.3) (P = 0.709) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OHIP-14 score correlated with the healing time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in UK (r = 0.4, P = 0.04) and the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> in Turkey (r = 0.4, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> per month was significantly higher in UK (3.3 +/- 2.8) compared with that in Turkey (1.5 +/- 2.5) (P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the number of filled teeth and frequency of tooth brushing were significantly lower in patients from Turkey compared with those in UK (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the duration since the last dental visit (5.1 +/- 7.2 months) was significantly lower in UK compared with that in Turkey (28.6 +/- 23.7 months) (P = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral QoL was similar in patients from UK and Turkey with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> was observed to be higher in UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As expected, a lower utilization rate of dental services might have led to a poorer oral health in patients from Turkey </plain></SENT>
