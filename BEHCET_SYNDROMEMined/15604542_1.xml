<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hormonal factors have long been proposed to play a role in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male sex, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, HLA-B51 positivity and a younger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> in BD are associated with severer disease, and the disease generally runs a milder course in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular involvement is more common, and the skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test (SPT) is more strongly positive in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BD rarely develops before puberty or after the age of 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations of the disease, with the exception of eye symptoms, tend to improve with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, BD may be <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> driven to some degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor (AR) levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (OU), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (GU) and SPT areas and compared them with those of adjacent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing skin/mucosa from patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with BD (16 female, 22 male; mean +/- SD age, 36.45 +/- 10.2 years), diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease, were included in the study with blind histological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsies from OU of 10 patients, GU of 11 patients, SPT areas of 17 patients and adjacent (approximately 2 cm distant) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing skin/mucosa in patients with BD were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nuclear AR levels were studied by an immunohistochemical technique, using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of positively staining cells was recorded as the AR index (ARI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the prevalence and the positivity rate of SPT has also been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ARI values in the lesional and control (non-lesional adjacent) skin/mucosa were found to be 14.5 versus 18% for OU, 28.7 versus 25.5% for GU and 36.3 versus 21.8% (p = 0.068) for SPT areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The positive SPT areas in male patients showed a higher ARI than those of female patients (43.36 and 23.33%; p = 0.078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The ARI values of SPT areas in male patients but not in female patients were found to be significantly higher as compared with non-lesional skin (21.63%; p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The SPT positivity was also more common in male patients compared with female patients (86.4% and 62.5%), although the difference was not significant (p = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>SPT have been found to be more strongly positive among the males (4.63 +/- 3.3) compared with female patients (3.18 +/- 1.9), and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> seem to play a role both in the formation and increased positivity of the SPT areas in male patients with BD </plain></SENT>
