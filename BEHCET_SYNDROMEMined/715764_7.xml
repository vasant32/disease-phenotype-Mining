<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A general increase in CSF amino acids was found in Group C (samples exhibiting both pleocytosis and increasing CSF protein concentration) and in "spinal canal block" and "neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Also, some abnormalities were detected in these groups with regard to changes in CSF cells, protein or IgG% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018378" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Guillain-Barré syndrome</z:e>" we noted an increase in CSF alanine, glycine, methionine, arginine and the branched-chain group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In "multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>" an increase was evident in CSF alanine, in plasma alanine and arginine, and in the plasma: CSF ratio of tyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor neuron diseases</z:e> (MND)" CSF glutamic acid, alanine, histidine and arginine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indicated an increase, along with the plasma: CSF ratio of tyrosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group C and in "neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome" glycine, methionine and lysine were lowered in the plasma: CSF ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, the ratio of valine in the former and histidine in the latter indicated a decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results can be supposed to reflect either biochemical abnormalities of plasma and/or the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, or changes in the transport systems of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
