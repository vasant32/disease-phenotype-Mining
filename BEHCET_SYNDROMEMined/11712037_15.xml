<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate local <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 60 expression and to quantify T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma delta-positive cells, which are known to respond to <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (n = 21) and controls (n = 18) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis was performed on peripheral blood to investigate TCR gamma delta-positive cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies were performed on active <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed by a streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> method using the monoclonal ML-30 antibody; <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> staining intensity and distribution were evaluated in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies were performed to quantify TCR gamma delta-positive cells at lesional sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mucocutaneous lesions of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had statistically significantly increased expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> 60/65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood TCR gamma delta-positive cell counts were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, lesional skin of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease had significantly increased gamma delta-positive T-cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> expression was found at lesional skin sites in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increased number of TCR gamma delta-positive cells, which are known to respond to <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, may support the function of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> in the etiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these findings may also be an epiphenomenon that needs to be further investigated </plain></SENT>
