<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The numbers and recurrence rates of mucocutaneous manifestations can be highly variable among patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (BS) but it is not known whether these differences influence the disease course at the long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the outcome of 30 patients that made up the placebo arm of a 6 months controlled trial of thalidomide and looked at the relation between the frequencies of mucocutaneous manifestations during the trial and the development of major organ involvement necessitating immunosuppressives during the post-trial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen (50%) patients had received immunosuppresives for major organ involvement during the post-trial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment were significantly younger at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of BS compared to those who did not (24.5±5 vs. 29.7±3.8 SD years; p=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> recorded throughout the trial was significantly higher among patients using immunosuppressives compared to those who did not (2.09±0.96 vs. 1.43±0.8; p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This significance disappeared when adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of BS (p=0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ROC curve analysis showed that having 10 or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> during 6 months has a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 53% for the subsequent necessity of immunosuppressive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same association was not true for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, follicular lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings on a limited number of patients suggest that frequent occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> during the initial years of the disease may predict the development of major organ involvement in men with BS </plain></SENT>
