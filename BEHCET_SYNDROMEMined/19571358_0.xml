<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the coronary guidewire and balloon were able to cross the CTO lesion retrogradely, the coronary guidewire was unable to cross antegradely after ballooning because of intractable engagement of the guiding catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 300 cm guidewire was inserted retrogradely and the guidewire was pulled out of the sheath placed in the right radial artery using a snare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the microcatheter was inserted antegradely into the RCA using the guidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 300 cm guidewire was removed and a standard guidewire was inserted antegradely into the RCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, a drug-eluting stent was successfully implanted in this difficult-to-treat CTO lesion </plain></SENT>
