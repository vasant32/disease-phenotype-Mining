<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of RA is important, since early and aggressive treatments lead to a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating autoantibodies are a serological hallmark of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More recently, antibodies directed to a cyclic citrullinated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies, have been established as specific diagnostic and prognostic tools for RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to assess the diagnostic and radiological prognostic value of the anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibody in Turkish patients with RA (n = 97) and those with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) (n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study also included 35 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies were measured by ELISA, and radiological damage was evaluated by using modified Larsen scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the RA group, sensitivity and specificity were 80.4% and 93.5% for rheumatoid factor (RF), and 74.2% and 97.8% for anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibody, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RF was positive in 3 BD patients (6.5%) and in one of the controls (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies were detected in one BD patient (2.2%), but not in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deformed joint counts and radiographic scores were higher in anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibody-positive RA patients (n = 72) than those in anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibody-negative patients (n = 25) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibody titer correlated with deformed joint count (r = 0.224, p &lt; 0.05) and radiographic score (r = 0.308, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study indicates the diagnostic and prognostic utility of anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies in Turkish patients with RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Importantly, anti-<z:chebi fb="97" ids="35889">CCP</z:chebi> antibodies are not associated with BD </plain></SENT>
