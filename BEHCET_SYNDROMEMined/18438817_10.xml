<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enthesopathy</z:e> is increased in this cluster, having features reminiscent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 35 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (BS-AA), 38 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (BS-WA), 37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS), 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), and 25 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five entheseal sites (the superior and inferior poles of the patella, the tibial tuberosity, and the superior and inferior poles of the calcaneus) on both lower extremities were examined by 2 independent observers, using ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A previously validated composite score was calculated for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of entheseal sites giving a positive power Doppler signal in each group were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AS had the highest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enthesopathy</z:e> score (mean +/- SD 4.1 +/- 2.4; F [4df] = 8.43, P &lt; 0.001) followed by BS-AA patients (3.0 +/- 1.9; F [3df] = 3.63, P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enthesopathy</z:e> scores among the remaining 3 groups were similar (for BS-WA, 1.8 +/- 1.4; for RA, 2.2 +/- 1.6; for healthy controls, 2.0 +/- 1.5 [F (2df) = 0.65, P = 0.53]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Power Doppler scores were highest for the BS-AA group (mean +/- SD 3.0 +/- 1.5; F [4df] = 15.54, P &lt; 0.001) followed by the AS group (2.7 +/- 1.8; F [3df] = 14.38, P &lt; 0.001), the RA group (2.6 +/- 1.8; F [2df] = 13.88, P &lt; 0.001), the BS-WA group (1.2 +/- 1.3; F [1df] = 4.48, P = 0.038), and the control group (0.5 +/- 1.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was 87% agreement between the 2 observers (kappa = 0.55, intraclass correlation coefficient 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enthesopathy</z:e> among BS-AA patients compared with that among BS-WA patients further supports the hypothesis that patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome who also have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> form a distinct cluster </plain></SENT>
