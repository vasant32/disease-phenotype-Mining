<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specifically, proteins, extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and separated by 2DE, were subjected to WB, using five serum samples from patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The detected candidate autoAgs were identified by mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, 17 autoantigenic spots were detected by the 2DE-WB, out of which eight spots were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are enolase-1, cofilin-1, vimentin, Rho-GDI beta protein, tubulin-like protein, and actin-like proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The autoAbs to one of the identified proteins, cofilin-1, were investigated by WB using a recombinant protein in 30 patients with BD, 35 patients with RA, 32 patients with SLE, and 16 patients with PM/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autoAbs to cofilin-1 were detected by WB in four (13.3%) of the 30 patients with BD, five (14.3%) of the 35 patients with RA, two (6.3%) of the 32 patients with SLE, and eight (24.2%) of the 33 patients with PM/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the generation of autoAbs to cofilin-1 may reflect common immunological disorders in BD, RA, and PM/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data would help understanding of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the proteomic approach would be a useful way to investigate autoAgs </plain></SENT>
