<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to analyze the OPN serum level in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and the association of gene polymorphisms of OPN and its receptors with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum level of OPN in active BD patients, inactive BD patients, and controls was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OPN and 4 SNPs of OPN receptors were genotyped in 318 BD patients and 313 controls using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OPN level was significantly increased in the serum of active BD patients compared with inactive BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNP analysis indicated an increased frequency of the OPN rs1126772 A allele in BD patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the significance was lost after Bonferroni correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of other SNPs of OPN and its receptors did not differ between BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that an increased serum OPN level was associated with clinical severity of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association of the tested SNPs of OPN and its receptors with BD in Chinese Han patients </plain></SENT>
