<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we investigated the long-term clinical outcomes and related prognostic factors after surgical treatment for intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 72 patients with intestinal BD who underwent surgery between March 1986 and May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors were identified by univariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test, and multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recurrence after surgical treatment was observed in 42 (58.3%) patients and reoperations were performed in 22 (30.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative recurrence rates after surgical treatment were 29.2% at 2 years and 47.2% at 5 years; the cumulative reoperation rates were 12.5% at 2 years and 22.2% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified volcano-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (≥ 4.4 mg/dL), and the presence of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> detected by pathology as independent predictive factors for recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, volcano-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, higher CRP levels (≥ 4.4 mg/dL), and a history of postoperative steroid therapy were independent predictive factors for reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to the current study, volcano-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, higher CRP levels, a history of postoperative steroid therapy, and the presence of intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> detected by pathology were factors of a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful follow-up is required in surgical patients with these risk factors, who are at high risk for recurrence and reoperation </plain></SENT>
