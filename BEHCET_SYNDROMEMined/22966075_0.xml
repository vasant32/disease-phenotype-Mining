<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and ninety-six consecutive Italian patients satisfying the ISG criteria for BD were followed up for 8 years, and 180 healthy age- and sex-matched blood donors were molecularly genotyped for the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique was used to serotype HLA-B51 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were subgrouped on the basis of the presence or absence of clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the CCR5Δ32 genotype differed between BD patients and controls (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CCR5Δ32 allele was more common in BD patients than in controls [P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) 2.28 (95% CI 1.1, 4.8)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the CCR5Δ32 allele (Δ32/Δ32 + CCR5/Δ32) were significantly more common in BD patients than in controls [P = 0.02, OR 2.37 (95% CI 1.1, 5.1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Population-attributable risk was 7.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In categorizing patients according to gender, the association between CCR5Δ32 polymorphism and BD was similar in females and males (ORs 2.76 and 2.0, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found when the frequencies of clinical manifestations were compared between CC5RΔ32 allele carriers and non-carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CCR5Δ32 polymorphism is associated with an increased susceptibility to develop BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemokines may have a role in the pathophysiology of BD </plain></SENT>
