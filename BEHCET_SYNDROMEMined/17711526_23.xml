<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natural course of BD is not fully known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We aimed retrospectively to determine the occurrence of the symptoms in chronological order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the influence of the treatment and follow-up on the clinical severity and tried to identify the factors determining severe organ involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six hundred and sixty-one patients were involved in this multicentre study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of the disease were recorded retrospectively in the time order of the manifestations in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcers</z:hpo> were the most common manifestation (100%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> (85.3%), papulopustular lesions (55.4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (44.2%), skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (37.8%), and articular (33.4%) and ocular involvement (29.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>Oral ulcers</z:hpo> were the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> manifestation (88.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- SD duration between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptom and the fulfilment of diagnostic criteria was calculated to be 4.3 +/- 5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical severity score was significantly increased in the noncompliant treatment group compared with the compliant group with the passage of time (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of ocular involvement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> was significantly higher in patients whose disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was at &lt; 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>Genital ulcers</z:hpo>, ocular involvement, papulopustular lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction were found to be significantly more frequent in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous lesions are the hallmarks of the disease, and especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> precede other manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increase in clinical severity score is more pronounced in patients without regular treatment and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Male sex and a younger age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are associated with more severe disease </plain></SENT>
