<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One month before this visit, he had had venous blood drawn from the same site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using color Doppler sonography, we diagnosed an iatrogenic pseudoaneurysm of the left radial artery, which was then treated with an ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A follow-up examination 6 months after the treatment revealed complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case report to demonstrate the use of this technique for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a pseudoaneurysm in a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that the safety, efficiency, speed, and minimal invasiveness of this procedure make it feasible for use as a treatment for peripheral pseudoaneurysms in such patients </plain></SENT>
