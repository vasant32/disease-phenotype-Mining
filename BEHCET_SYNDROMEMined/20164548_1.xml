<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of IkappaBalpha promoter polymorphisms in the development of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, eighty-six patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 120 healthy controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IkappaBalpha -881A/G, -826C/T, -550A/T, -519C/T, and -297C/T polymorphisms were measured by the method of polymerase chain reaction/ restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that the genotype frequencies of IkappaBalpha -826C/T and -826T/T were significantly higher in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in the dominant and in the recessive models, the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease have higher frequencies of the IkappaBalpha -826T containing genotype than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of IkappaBalpha -826T was significantly increased in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the IkappaBalpha -881A -826T -550A -519C -297C and IkappaBalpha -881A -826T -550A -519T -297C haplotypes were significantly higher in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the haplotype frequency of IkappaBalpha -881A -826C -550A -519C -297C in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study also revealed that the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with IkappaBalpha -826T/T have higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> than those without IkappaBalpha -826T/T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the IkappaBalpha -826T allele, IkappaBalpha -881A -826T -550A -519C -297C and IkappaBalpha -881A -826T -550A -519T -297C haplotypes might be associated with susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IkappaBalpha -826T/T genotype was related to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
