<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features of 216 consecutive Caucasian patients were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seven patients had been diagnosed as having a primary systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>-specifically, 39 had temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (TA), 25 polyarteritis nodosa (<z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>), 9 Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e>), and 34 Behcet's disease (BD)-, 90 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), and 19 had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151449" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary Sjogren's syndrome</z:e> (SS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AECA were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and four (48%) patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> were found to have a positive titre of AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specifically, AECA were detected in 41 (38%) patients with a primary systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (13 (33%) with TA, 14 (56%) with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>, 5 (56%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> and 9 (26%) with BD), in 58 (63%) patients with SLE, and in 5 (26%) patients with a primary SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with a primary systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, those with AECA were found to have an increased prevalence of disease activity (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SLE patients, those with AECA were found to have an increased prevalence of vascular lesions (P &lt; 0.05), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.05), and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> have a high prevalence of AECA and they are associated with the presence of vascular lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and aCL in SLE, as well as with disease activity in several primary systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (TA, <z:chebi fb="59" ids="53571">PAN</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WG</z:e> and BD) </plain></SENT>
