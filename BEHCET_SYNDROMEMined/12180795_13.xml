<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to investigate whether increased production of ROS may affect erythrocyte oxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), one of the end products of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, in plasma and erythrocyte, and the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-Px), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes, in erythrocyte, also C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were measured in 22 patients in active stage of the disease and also in 30 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased CRP, ESR, and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels in plasma and erythrocyte and increased SOD but decreased GSH-Px activities in erythrocytes were observed in the patients, when compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, significantly positive correlations between plasma and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-CRP, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-ESR, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>-SOD, SOD-ESR and SOD-CRP levels, but negative correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and erythrocyte GSH-Px, were found in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It may be suggested that increased production of ROS in BD, as reflected by higher plasma and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels, may impair erythrocyte membrane integrity and also may lead to the alterations in the erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system, as reflected by higher SOD and lower GSH-Px activities in erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
