<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical effect of low doses of cyclosporin (5 mg/kg/day) on 20 patients of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with refractory ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of cyclosporin was judged by the frequency of ocular inflammatory attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was effective in more than 70% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it had some adverse side effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">indigestion</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most side effects were mild with low dose treatment, but neurological side effects were similar in frequency and severity to those seen with 10 mg/kg/day usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that low dose cyclosporin (5 mg/kg/day) administration may be acceptable as a standard plan for treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but that we have to use cyclosporin with great attention to its side effects, especially neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
