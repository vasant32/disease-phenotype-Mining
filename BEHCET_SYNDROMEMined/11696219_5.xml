<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic evidence supports that the susceptible gene for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is the HLA-B51 allele at the HLA-B locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to determine the HLA-B51 nucleotide sequence variation in three <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients and three healthy controls in order to elucidate if any disease specific mutations or polymorphisms may exist in the HLA-B51 gene of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was first carried out to give a PCR-amplified product of 9.5 kb which was then used as a template for nested PCR to give a final amplified product of 4.2 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This final product containing the 1.3-kb promoter/enhancer region and the entire HLA-B gene except for a 363-bp 3' terminal end segment encoding the 3' untranslated region was subcloned by the BP cloning technique and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequencing results showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients possessed the HLA-B*51011 allele, and there were no differences in the exonic nucleotide sequences between the three <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients and the three healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B*51011 intronic and promoter/enhancer nucleotide sequences from the three patients had 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a single insertion of 6 bp and a single deletion of 2 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the three healthy controls had 24 SNPs in their intronic and promoter/enhancer regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, none of these polymorphisms in the patients were specific for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these results clearly demonstrate that the HLA-B exonic sequence that encodes the HLA-B51 allele is the real pathogenic factor in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
