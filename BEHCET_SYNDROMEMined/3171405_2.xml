<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy patients were investigated and 27 of them (38%) had history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>; they were compared to 27 healthy subjects and to 16 hospitalized patients in whom the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease was ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic activity after a 10 minute venous occlusion was significantly decreased while fibrinogen, factor VIII and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor was increased as well as the tPA inhibitor (PAI-I): the last 3 proteins are synthetized by the endothelial cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between patients with or without history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coagulation and fibrinolysis changes observed are not specific of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease since they were also found in a population of patients without <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease and without history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
