<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic features of 100 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) and 100 healthy controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the individuals had a family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> in the patient and control group, and none of the individuals in the control group had a family history of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MEFV gene analysis was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with BD and healthy controls; twelve different regions were scanned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the BD group, mutations were detected in more than one region in 27 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients had heterozygous and two patients had compound heterozygous mutations (M680I-V726A and M694 V-A744S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent mutation was M694 V with an allelic frequency of 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies of E148Q, M680I (G/C), and V726A were 3, 2, and 2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies of P369S, A744S, and K695R were 1, 1, and 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MEFV gene analysis revealed mutations in 27 (27%) of the individuals in the control group; the allelic frequency was 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most frequent mutation was E148Q that was detected in 16 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One individual was compound heterozygote (E148Q-M694 V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies of E148Q, M694 V, V726A, and M680I were 8, 3, 1.5, and 0.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies of K695R and P369S were 0.5 and 0.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequency was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was not a significant relation between the mutations in the BD group and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
