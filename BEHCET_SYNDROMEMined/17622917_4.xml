<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency and characteristics of peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine BD patients (36 women, 33 men) followed by neurology and dermatology outpatient clinics between October 1999 and October 2004 were enrolled into study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A careful history was taken and physical and neurologic examinations were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other medical causes that may be related to peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent nerve conduction studies using standard electrophysiologic procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement was detected in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no sign and symptom related to peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Causes other than BD were found in 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic delay in conduction velocities of the median nerves was detected in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients with clinically evident peripheral nerve involvement due to BD, 3 had sensorimotor and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003390'>sensory axonal neuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Axonal type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> may be seen in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Peripheral involvement may be detected by electrophysiological examinations in asymptomatic BD patients </plain></SENT>
