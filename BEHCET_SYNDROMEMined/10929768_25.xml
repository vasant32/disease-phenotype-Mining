<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 75 healthy individuals matched for age and sex served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytokine levels were determined using commercially available ELISA kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 patients with active disease and 19 with inactive disease, 38 (51%) and 4 (21%), respectively, and 23 healthy controls (31%) were found to have detectable levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in their serum (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, increased IL-8 serum levels were found in patients with active disease (median 12 pg/ml, P = 0.010) compared to patients with inactive disease (&lt; or = 10 pg/ml) and to healthy controls (&lt; or = 10 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In particular, patients with oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (n = 51, 34 pg/ml) and neurological features (n = 4, 71 pg/ml) exhibited increased IL-8 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no correlation between disease activity and the serum levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second set of experiments, the involvement of dermal microvascular endothelial cells in IL-8 secretion was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immortalized human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1 cells) were maintained for 4 h in vitro with serum from 18 ABD patients or with IL-1beta, a known stimulator of IL-8 synthesis, TNF-alpha or their combination at five- to tenfold higher concentrations than those found in the serum of ABD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased IL-8 secretion was found after incubation with ABD patients' serum (median 20 pg/ml), but IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta + TNF-alpha failed to induce IL-8 secretion by HMEC-1 cells (&lt; or = 1-1.2 pg/ml) in biologically relevant concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study showed increased IL-8 serum levels in ABD patients with active oral and neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Human microvascular endothelial cells may, at least partially, be responsible for the enhanced IL-8 secretion in the active stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
