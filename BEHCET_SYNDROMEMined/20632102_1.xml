<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But unlike CD and UC, serologic markers for intestinal BD are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, anti-α-enolase antibody (AAEA) has been detected in sera from BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of AAEA in intestinal BD and its clinical correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study sample included 80 patients with intestinal BD and 23 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgM AAEA was detected by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positivity of IgM AAEA was defined as an optical density greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the control sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other parameters, such as demographic information, subtype of BD, colonoscopic findings, disease severity and treatment modality, were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of IgM AAEA was 67.5% in intestinal BD and 0% in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positivity rate of IgM AAEA was higher in complete or incomplete BD than in suspected BD (77.5% vs. 51.6%, P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean HBI score was higher in antibody positive patients than in antibody negative patients (5.60 vs. 4.61, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of steroid use for aggravation of intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms was higher in antibody positive patients than in antibody negative patients (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with systemic involvement was higher in the AAEA positive group than in the negative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring IgM AAEA may be helpful for diagnosis of intestinal BD and could be used to predict clinical course and disease severity </plain></SENT>
