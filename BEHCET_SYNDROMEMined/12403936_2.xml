<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Defects in immune responses have been reported in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> and its contribution to the pathogenesis, we have studied Fas ligand (FasL) expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and mononuclear cells in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FasL expression in PBL was studied with RT-PCR and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-human FasL antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression of FasL in cryostat sections of biopsy specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum lesions from 4 patients with BD and of a genital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> lesion in another patient using immunohistochemical staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was detected with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and FasL protein expression was detected marginally in the unstimulated PBL, and was induced upon activation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PBL from patients with BD exhibited an enhanced expression of FasL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and FasL protein without in vitro stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation failed to augment FasL expression of their lymphocytes, suggesting a dysregulation of FasL expression of PBL in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The skin biopsy specimens revealed that cells infiltrating into <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> expressed FasL and there were several TUNEL staining-positive cells in the lesions, suggesting that Fas/FasL-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is involved in the development of the skin lesion and thus may be associated with the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an excessive expression of FasL in circulating as well as skin-infiltrating lymphocytes and the presence of apoptotic cells in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, suggesting that lymphocytes expressing FasL aberrantly may play a role in the development and pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
