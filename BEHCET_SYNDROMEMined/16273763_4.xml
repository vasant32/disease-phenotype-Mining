<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a stimulant of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> while monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) is induced by shear stresses leading to vascular collateral development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 has been also shown to contribute to the recanalization of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, up-regulation of secreted <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and VEGF was observed following stimulation with TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In view of the above functions of VEGF, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and TNF-alpha, we hypothesized that these factors may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> seen in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 36 patients with a diagnosis of BD were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BD patients were separated into 3 groups with respect to vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group BD-AT (n = 9) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, BD-CT (n = 12) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and BD-MC (n = 15) with mucocutaneous involvement only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The control group (group H) was comprised of 20 healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, DC-AT (n= 11) and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> DC-CT (n = 9) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> without BD served as disease controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum measurements of VEGF <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and TNF-alpha were performed by quantitative sandwich ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase reactants, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of VEGF were significantly higher in the patients in group BD-AT than either in group BD-CT or BD-MC (p = 0.03 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was found for VEGF levels of thrombotic patients regarding the cause (BD-AT vs. DC-AT, p = 0.063; BD-CT vs. DC-CT, p = 0.084) or the stage of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (DC-AT vs. DC-CT, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Both BD patients and disease controls with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had significantly higher levels of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 as compared to corresponding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> patients (BD-AT vs. DC-CT; p &lt; 0.001; DC-AT vs. DC-CT, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD and disease controls had significantly higher serum TNF-alpha level when compared with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No significant difference with respect to serum TNF-alpha level was noted when patient subgroups with BD and disease controls were compared with each other Serum levels of VEGF, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, and TNF-alpha were not found to be correlated with either ESR or CRP (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of VEGF and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 detected in BD <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> suggest the possible role of those angiogenic cytokines in the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although not specific for BD, detection of VEGF or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 levels seems to serve as an assay for differentiation of BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
