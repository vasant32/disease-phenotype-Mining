<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This may indicate a hyperreactivity, and in two instances a spontaneous blastogenesis prior to addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulins and complement levels in serum were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
