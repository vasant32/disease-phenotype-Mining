<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NC values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMN were lower than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes with mean values of 5.0% and 30%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NC values of patients' PMN were also lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ADCC values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PMN were moderately high with a mean value of 16.0%, which was almost a half of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher ADCC values of PMN were found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, SLE and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, and in these cases the ADCC values of their lymphocytes were extremely low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The supernatants of PMN mix-cultured with unlabeled K562 or the antibody-coated P815 cells were fairly cytotoxic to both cells, though the similar supernatants of lymphocytes were cytotoxic only to K562 cells, but not to the antibody-coated P815 cells </plain></SENT>
