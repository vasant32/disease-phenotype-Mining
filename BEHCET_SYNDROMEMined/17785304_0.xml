<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proteins recognized by antibodies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> have been intensively studied over the past two decades since cDNAs encoding autoantigens have become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identity of many of them has been defined, and specific structural motifs or post-translational modifications, which may be important to explain the generation of such antibodies during the autoimmune process, have been pointed out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screening of human umbilical artery or microvascular endothelial cell expression libraries appears to be a useful tool for the characterization of endothelial autoantigens allowing us to identify several molecules recognized from serum anti-endothelial cell antibodies of patients with diseases characterized by immune-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
