<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has long been postulated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo>, which are possibly induced by microbial pathogens in genetically susceptible individuals, are important in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent findings have both supported the significance of genetic factors and better defined the nature of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic studies have strengthened the primary association of HLA-B51 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exact pathogenic mechanism of the HLA-B51 molecule is still unknown, and its contribution to the overall genetic susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is estimated to be less than 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and/or induced overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (mainly Th1 type) from various cellular sources seems responsible for the enhanced inflammatory reaction in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and it may be associated with the genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An antigen-driven immune response superimposed on this primed-state and induced by heat shock proteins or other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> from different strains of streptoccocci or other microbial agents has been suggested to trigger manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endothelial activation/injury and the resultant occlusive vasculopathy may also contribute to the tissue damage </plain></SENT>
