<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed a novel assay using human thrombomodulin (TM), which detected overall abnormalities in the protein C <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> pathway (PC pathway) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This assay indicates the degree of inhibition of prothrombinase by TM, which is represented as the percentage of prothrombinase inhibition by 25 ng/ml of TM, termed PIP25 (Prothrombinase Inhibition Percentage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined PIP25 in plasma samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), and patients with miscellaneous thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> and compared these with the PIP25 of plasma samples from healthy volunteers in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PIP25S were significantly lower in SLE alone (35.5 +/- 12.8%, P = 0.036) and SLE with LA (33.0 +/- 13.3%, P = 0.030) and BD (33.3 +/- 13.4%, P = 0.010) than those in healthy volunteers (43.5 +/- 10.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significance between healthy PIP25 and those with miscellaneous thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> (44.2 +/- 8.4%, P = 0.823) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the abnormalities of the protein C <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> pathway were present in patients with SLE(LA) and BD </plain></SENT>
