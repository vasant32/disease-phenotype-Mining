<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of HLA class II gene with BD has been described to be different according to different countries and regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the association between polymorphism of HLA-DRB1 alleles and BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with BD and 100 healthy controls were typed for HLA-DRB1 alleles by the LABType SSO method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was significantly higher in BD patients than in controls (P &lt; 0.05), while the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was markedly lower in BD patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding clinical manifestations, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly decreased in BD patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> compared with controls (P &lt; 0.05); the frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was significantly increased in BD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions and in BD patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp>-like lesions when compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the frequency of HLA-DRB1*14 was significantly increased in BD patients under 20 years of age at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease (P &lt; 0.01), while the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 was significantly decreased in them (P &lt; 0.05), compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggested that HLA-DRB1 alleles might play an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and clinical manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
