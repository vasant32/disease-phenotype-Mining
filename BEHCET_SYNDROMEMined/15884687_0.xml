<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The two-stage classification process proposed by the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) multicenter criteria committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> was applied after completion of a questionnaire about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stage I: A plain questionnaire to a sample of 90 (41 female and 49 male) patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, mean age 37.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage II: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with wide spread pain were examined by a physician blinded to the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> for 18 tender points and 4 control non-tender points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sample of 40 (16 female and 24 male) healthy individuals were examined as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 53 (58.9%) patients with BD with widespread pain compared to 6 (15%) individuals in the control group, whereas only 8 (8.9%) (7 female and 1 male) patients with BD fulfilled the 1990 ACR criteria for classification of FMS, compared to one individual in the controls (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significantly more females with BD having FMS compared to male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also the FMS associated features were more prevalent in BD group compared to control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FMS and widespread pain are more prevalent in patients with BD than in the general population while it is less prevalent when compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0810058" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other connective tissue diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a trend for an increased frequency of FMS in females with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BD patients with FMS may benefit from psychological evaluation as a part of their treatment </plain></SENT>
