<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, two discrete protein bands of approximately 72 and 74 kDa, were found to be present in B cells of naive Lewis rats as well as in EBV transformed B cells from a human patient with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhanced expression of these <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-binding proteins was achieved by incubating the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) from S. typhimurium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The approximately 72 and 74 kDa <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-binding proteins reacted in western blot with monoclonal antibodies specific for both constitutively expressed and inducible 72/74 kDa hsp 70 proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that these proteins bind to the immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> of IRBP indicates that they may play a role in the processing and presentation of antigens by antigen-presenting cell (APC) </plain></SENT>
