<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) employing delta-bar-delta training algorithm was used to detect the presence of ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spectral analysis of the ophthalmic arterial Doppler signals was performed by least squares (LS) autoregressive (AR) method for determining the MLPNN inputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MLPNN was trained with training set, cross validated with cross validation set and tested with testing set </plain></SENT>
