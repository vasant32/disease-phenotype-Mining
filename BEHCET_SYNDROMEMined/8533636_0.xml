<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 100 cells were examined per subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytolysosomes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003736'>autophagic vacuoles</z:hpo>) were frequently observed in cells of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average frequency of appearance of cytolysosomes was 5.4 +/- 1.5% (mean +/- deviation) in erythrocytes of the 5 patients, and 0.5 +/- 0.4% in those of the 3 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cytolysosomes of erythrocytes may reflect abnormal production or removal involved in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
