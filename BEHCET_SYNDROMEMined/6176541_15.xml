<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average IFN titer was 51.4 +/- 9.3 IU/ml in the patients and 5.9 +/- 1.1 IU/ml in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were then divided into two groups according to the stage of ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients in the ocular convalescent stage had higher IFN levels (61.3 +/- 11.2 IU/ml) than did 12 patients in the exacerbation stage (13.2 +/- 3.0 IU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the kinetics of the IFN level in the circulation of seven patients showed a significant decrease of IFN in the exacerbation stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN activity in sera from patients was destroyed by acid treatment and heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min and was not neutralized with anti-human IFN-alpha and -beta sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was demonstrated that vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus inhibitors detected in sera from both the patients and the controls had no effect on our IFN assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, antiviral activity detected in sera of patients seems to be due to gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
