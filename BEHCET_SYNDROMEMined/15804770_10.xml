<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To define the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) and fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographic (FFA) features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 49 eyes of 25 patients (19 males, 6 females; mean age: 34.1 years; age range: 14-68 years) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and active ocular involvement that fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient, FFA and ICG angiography were performed consecutively in the same session using a TRC-50I/A fundus camera (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan) coupled to an Image Net digitizing system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were analyzed and FFA, ICG, and clinical findings summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean duration of ocular involvement was 52.4 months (range: 2-240 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FFA showed staining and dye leakage at the optic disc in 44 (89.8%) eyes and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in 36 (73.5%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were observed in 31 (63.3%) and 3 (6.1%) eyes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight (16.3%) eyes exhibited detectable <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> FFA alterations, but no abnormalities on ICG angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disc ICG hyperfluorescence was observed in 23 (46.9%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography revealed choroidal fuzziness in 16 (32.6%) eyes, hyperfluorescent spots in 13 (26.5%) eyes, and hypofluorescent plaques in 12 (24.5%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven eyes (22.4%) showed no abnormal findings on ICG angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICG and FFA complement each other as tools for diagnosing patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FFA often serves as a fairly reliable guide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although some ICG findings cannot be demonstrated by FFA, they are not specific or pathognomonic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We do not recommend performing both procedures for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
