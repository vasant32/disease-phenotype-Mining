<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 176 Italian patients who satisfied the International Study Group criteria for BD and 134 healthy age- and sex- matched blood donors were genotyped for A-13G and G79A polymorphisms of the protein Z gene by molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>113 and 112 of the 176 BD patients were also genotyped for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serological HLA class B51 typing was performed by a standard microlymphocytotoxicity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were subgrouped according to the presence or absence of clinical manifestations.RESULTS: The distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of A-13G and G79A polymorphisms did not differ significantly between BD patients and healthy controls.The frequencies of carriage rates of protein Z G79A and A-13G polymorphisms in BD patients with and without DVT were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no associations between thrombotic events and the protein Z gene polymorphisms studied were observed in BD patients carrying factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene G20210A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were observed between protein Z polymorphisms and the occurrence of specific clinical findings.CONCLUSION: No association between DVT and A-13G or G79A polymorphisms of the protein Z gene was found in Italian BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these protein Z polymorphisms in BD do not seem to increase the risk of DVT due to factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene G20210A mutations </plain></SENT>
