<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most remarkable aspect of this case is the patient's ethnic group since <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is less frequent in Africans than Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most likely explanation for this difference is the absence of genetic susceptibility linked to HLAB51 that is rare in Africans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However lack of awareness of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and changes in environmental triggers in Africa cannot be ruled out </plain></SENT>
