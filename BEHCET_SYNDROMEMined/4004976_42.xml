<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been theorized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is immune complex mediated, and is characterized by multiple attacks which often lead to severe visual handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> patients with severe ocular involvement and cytotoxic and/or systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> agent failures were treated with cyclosporin (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CsA therapy effectively abrogated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the ocular attack and either totally prevented, or markedly reduced, the recurrences of these attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Generally, patients tolerated the medication well; occasionally however, renal toxicity secondary to cyclosporin therapy prevented prescription of a maximally effective therapeutic dose of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CsA levels in plasma were dose-dependent for each patient, but the dosage per kg of CsA needed to obtain a specific plasma level varied greatly from patient to patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circulating immune complex levels were not universally elevated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ocular attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, increases in circulating immune complex concentrations were noted after treatment with CsA was begun and the disease became clinically inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data, as well as the effectiveness of CsA, an agent with predominantly anti-T cell effects, raise a question as to whether circulating immune complexes are centrally relevant to the pathogenesis of this disorder, and if T cell mediation of this disease must be contemplated </plain></SENT>
