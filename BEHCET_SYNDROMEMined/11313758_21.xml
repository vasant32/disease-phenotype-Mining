<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the possibility that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-BD may indeed be carriers of a single mutated MEFV is further analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of mutations in the coding region of MEFV of eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>-BD, representing six families with 47 members, was determined by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A possible role for the non-carrier chromosome and for BD in the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> in patients with a single mutated MEFV allele was determined by analysing the association between these variables and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> in heterozygous kin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients had indeed only one mutation in the coding region of MEFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' non-carrier chromosomes converged into three different MEFV haplotypes and were shared by heterozygous unaffected kin in five of six families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BD was found in 10 of 11 carriers with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> vs one of 16 carriers without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> may be expressed in individuals harbouring only one coding mutation in MEFV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings argue against a role for the non-carrier chromosome in the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, and suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> phenotype in this cohort was associated with the simultaneous presence of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may mirror a more generalised rule, that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> may be precipitated in carriers of a single mutated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> gene by factors unrelated to the other MEFV allele </plain></SENT>
