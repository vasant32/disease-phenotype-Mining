<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the possible association between these two diseases, this study is designed to determine the frequency of non-diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sera of 288 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were screened with anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with a positive test underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and duodenal biopsies to confirm the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> were put on a gluten free diet to evaluate its efficacy on the improvement of their lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients had positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody test (two with positive anti-endomysial antibody as well) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duodenal biopsies showed findings compatible with Marsh 3 in one and Marsh 1 in three other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the diagnosed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> responded to the gluten free diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings didn't support any association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> in Iranian patients compared to the general population of Iran </plain></SENT>
