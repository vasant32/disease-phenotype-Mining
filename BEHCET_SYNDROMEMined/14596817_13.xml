<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied cytokine production in patients with active and inactive BD, and evaluated the effect of treatment with infliximab (anti-TNF-alpha antibody) on disease activity and cytokine production by the ELISPOT assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numbers of cells spontaneously secreting IFN-gamma, IL-12, and TNF-alpha were significantly increased in patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">Mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated IL-4 secretion was elevated in active patients, though the ratio of IFN-gamma:IL-4 secreting cells was significantly increased in active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, we monitored cytokine production and expression of IL-12 receptor beta1 chain (IL-12Rbeta1) during short- and long-term infliximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single infusion of infliximab significantly reduced the number of PBMC secreting TNF-alpha within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rise in TNF-alpha production was associated with clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infliximab treatment induced a significant increase in the number of cells secreting IFN-gamma and expressing IL-12Rbeta1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A favorable clinical response to infliximab was associated with a persistent reduction in TNF-alpha secretion, but did not correlate with IFN-gamma production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that TNF-alpha plays a pivotal role in BD, and that anti-TNF-alpha therapy both reduces TNF-alpha production and modulates the functional activity of type 1 cells </plain></SENT>
