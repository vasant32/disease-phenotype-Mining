<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease have been reported to be sensitised to S-antigen (S-Ag) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, four T cell clones established from the peripheral blood of a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A CD4+ T cell clone (clone 2) and a CD8+ T cell clone (clone 10) proliferated specifically to bovine S-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although these S-Ag specific T cell clones proliferated vigorously to the intact antigen, their responses to S-Ag derived synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> M and G were weak, suggesting that the sites of human T cell recognition of S-Ag may be different from those established in the experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proliferative responses of both clones (2 and 10) were inhibited by anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody but not by anti-HLA-class 1 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two clones studied, clones 6 and 30, were CD3+, CD4-, CD8-, and they did not proliferate specifically to S-Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clone 6 expressed gamma delta T cell receptors (TCR) and showed non-specific cytotoxic activity toward K562 and Daudi cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clone 30 expressed alpha beta TCR, and was devoid of cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human T cell lines and clones specific to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> antigens will provide the framework necessary to examine the events that lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
