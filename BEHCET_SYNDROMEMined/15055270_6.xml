<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> are common among the arterial lesions, affecting various arteries but mostly the abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical interposition graft insertion is the treatment of choice for large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in these patients is the reason for the notorious surgical complications that result in up to 50% false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in anastomotic sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, endovascular repair for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> has been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To learn more about vascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's and, specifically, to compare the results of surgical treatment and endovascular repair of AAA in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrieved the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 53 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease admitted to Rambam Medical Center during the years 1985 and 2001, and analysed the results and follow-up of open surgery versus endovascular repair of AAA in patients with known <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 53 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease 18 had vascular manifestations (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AAAs were encountered in 8 patients (15%) and 5 were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Open surgery (group 1), under general anesthesia, lasted less than 3 hours with an average aortic damping time of 34 minutes (range 26-41 min) after which the patients were transferred to the intensive care unit for 24-48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment (group 2), although lasting about the same time without the need for intensive care, necessitated contrast media and fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The length of hospital stay was considerably shorter for patients after endovascular repair compared to open surgery (3 days vs. 6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Combined mortality and morbidity was higher in patients who underwent open surgery compared to endovascular repair (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, one major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> and three anastomotic pseudoaneurysms compared to one temporary contrast-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients with AAA are better candidates for endovascular treatment than atherosclerotic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Combined morbidity (especially anastomotic pseudoaneurysms) and mortality of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients after endovascular repair is considerably lower than after open surgery </plain></SENT>
