<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of BD is unknown, although raised levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a family of critical transcriptional factors involved in the regulation of a large variety of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the -94 insertion/deletion ATTG promoter polymorphism of the NF-kappaB1 gene (NFKB1) in 86 patients with BD and 100 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the -94ins ATTG (I) allele was 61.6% in patients with BD and 59% in controls and the frequency of the -94 del ATTG (D) allele was 38.4% in patients with BD and 41% in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the -94ins ATTG (I) allele was significantly higher in patients with ocular involvement (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the genotype study, the overall frequencies of II, ID and DD were 40.7%, 41.9%, and 17.4% in the patient group and 30%, 58% and 12% in the control group (P: 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The II genotype was significantly higher in patients with ocular involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> or papulopustular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the II, ID and DD genotypes showed no marked difference in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> positivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> or vascular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was found for gender, positive family history or age at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence that the -94ins/del ATTG promoter polymorphism of NFKB1 may have functional consequences in BD, especially in patients with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
