<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system occurs in 10%-29% of cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of repetitive auditory stimulations on event-related potentials (ERP) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s without neurologic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 14 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ERPs were recorded from Fz, Cz and Pz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The auditory ERPs test was continued until 20 artefact-free rare tones were averaged, which was accepted as one trial block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After six blocks were obtained in a sequential manner, the test was completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the results of the present study, P300 latency changed in different manners over trial blocks in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>P300 latency values showed a progressive increase in the controls; however this was not determined in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e> was not observed in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of the lack of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e> related to P300 latency, it may be thought that there is an insidious pathologic process in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> without neurologic manifestation </plain></SENT>
