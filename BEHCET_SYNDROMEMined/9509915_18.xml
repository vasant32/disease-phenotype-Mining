<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sometimes, clinical symptoms appear after treatment of these foci in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is believed that BD might be related to an allergic reaction to a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in view of the many clinical symptoms, especially the presence of aphthous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital ulcerations</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An attempt to obtain cutaneous responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> antigens has been carried out using various vaccines developed from bacteria isolated from the ulcerative lesions and oral cavities of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BD patients often show intense hypersensitivity to various strains of streptococci, not only by their cutaneous reactions but also by in vitro testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe our previous studies on the correlation between streptococcal antigens and the pathogenesis of BD and also discuss the recent reports of other authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intense hypersensitivity to streptococcal antigens acquired after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal infection</z:e> is thought to play an important role in the appearance of symptoms in BD patients since the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was enhanced when stimulated with streptococcal antigen in a culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi>, an antibiotic to which certain strains of streptococci are sensitive, reduced the frequency of clinical symptoms in BD patients as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by BD-PBMC stimulated with streptococcal antigen </plain></SENT>
