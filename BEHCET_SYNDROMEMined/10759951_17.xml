<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: We reviewed six cases of vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, four of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and seven inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which underwent surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue using a labelled streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> method, as was in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, neutrophils and lymphocytes accumulated around the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were prominent as compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elastic fibres were not severely destroyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial cells (ECs) of most vasa vasorum expressed HLA-DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of vasa vasorum around which inflammatory infiltrating cells were observed in vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease was significantly greater than in inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cytokines IL-1alpha, TNF-beta and IFN-gamma were expressed in neutrophils and lymphocytes which were distributed around vasa vasorum, as well as neutrophils adherent to HLA-DR positive ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that vasculo-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease should be classified as a neutrophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> targeting the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> formation may be related to degeneration of arterial wall caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
