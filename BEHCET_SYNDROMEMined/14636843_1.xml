<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is believed to be involved in the progression of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought the source of IL-8 in the enucleated eye of the present patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 40-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His vision deteriorated due to persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His left eye had lens-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003665'>endophthalmitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: The left eye had to be enucleated, and it was investigated by an immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies for CD 1a (dendritic cells), CD 3 (T cells), CD 68 (monocytes/macrophages), interferon-gamma, or IL-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fibrovascular tissue had formed on and beneath the lens where inflammatory cells had infiltrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the mononuclear inflammatory cells were T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large number of macrophages were observed especially around the lens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interferon-gamma-positive cells were scattered, while IL-8 was observed only in the accumulated granulocytes, but not in either mononuclear cells or macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-8 is thus considered to play a role in the progression of intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and granulocytes are thought to be a possible source of IL-8 in <z:mp ids='MP_0003665'>endophthalmitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
