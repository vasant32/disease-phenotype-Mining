<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Circulating antibodies that bind to human endothelial cells cultured in vitro have been detected in a variety of diseases, including <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this disorder the reported prevalence of AECA has varied widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One likely source of variability is the ELISA assay itself, in which differing conditions and reagents have been used in different reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have re-examined the frequency of AECA in 132 Turkish <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients and 50 healthy Turkish controls, comparing several different methods of preparing the target endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used either: 1) fresh and non-treated, 2) fixed, or 3) TNF alpha-stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stages of the procedures were performed at room temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients, using fresh, non-treated HUVEC, 17 of 130 (13.1%) and 9 of 132 (6.8%) sera were positive for IgG- and IgM-AECA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, among 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 2 (4.0%) had IgG-positive and 4 (8.0%) had IgM-positive ELISAs under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in the frequency of positives between patients and controls was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fixed HUVEC and TNF alpha-treated HUVEC gave similar results as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When group means were examined, only the mean for IgG-AECA determined with TNF alpha-stimulated HUVEC reached statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The discrepancy between our data and earlier reports in the literature probably reflects the methodological differences alluded to, and highlights the difficulties in interpreting ELISA assays for AECA </plain></SENT>
