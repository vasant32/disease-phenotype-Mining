<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with a mean age of 41.3 years (range 21-64) and 41 control subjects with a mean age of 39.5 years (range 18-66) were selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, four pupillometric techniques were used: pupil cycle time (PCT), dark-adapted pupil size (DAPS), 0.05% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39462">pilocarpine</z:chebi> drop test, and 1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> drop test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four tests, there were significant differences between the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean PCTs were 1,156 ms (range 856-1,560 ms) and 919 ms (range 650-1,261 ms) in the patients and controls, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean DAPS was 0.45 (range 0.31-0.66) in the patients, whereas it was 0.56 (range 0.42-0.67) in controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Iris sensitivity to both 0.05% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39462">pilocarpine</z:chebi> and 1% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> showed significant differences between patients and controls, respectively (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four tests, only 0.05% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39462">pilocarpine</z:chebi> sensitivity was correlated with the duration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system innervating the iris is affected in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This involvement may be due to the vasculitic nature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
