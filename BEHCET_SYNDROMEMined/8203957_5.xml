<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with BD were prospectively and consecutively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aEC were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein (large vessel) as well as from retroperitoneal adipose tissue (microvasculature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients (50%) had aEC, either directed to large vessel [8(26%) patients] or microvascular [13(43%) patients] endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of active patients was significantly higher in the aEC-positive group [12(80%) patients] compared with the aEC-negative group [5(33%) patients] (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BD have a high prevalence of aEC when microvascular endothelial cells are used in the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These antibodies seem to be a marker of disease activity in this condition, previously considered as negative for autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
