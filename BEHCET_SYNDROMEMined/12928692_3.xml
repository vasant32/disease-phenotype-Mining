<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular oedema</z:hpo> (CMO) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 67 eyes of 35 Behcet's patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, but well-controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and CMO were randomised into a double-masked, crossover trial comparing the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> vs placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients received an initial 4-week course of either 250 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> twice daily (b.i.d.) or placebo, followed by a 4-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They then received a 4-week course of the reverse study medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An improvement in visual acuity and fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographic findings was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 29 patients (55 eyes) completed the trial and were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 29, 16 men and 13 were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The age range was 13-50 years (mean 33.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> showed a slightly better improvement of angiographic signs (at least by one grade improvement) over that of placebo (12 vs five eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also had less deterioration of angiographic signs over that of placebo (three vs seven eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, these findings were not statistically significant (P=0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> had no statistically significant effect (P=0.53) on the improvement of visual acuity of patients over that of placebo (13 vs eight eyes), nor on the deterioration of visual acuity (three vs 11 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite seemingly favourable results, the 4-week course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (250 mg b.i.d.) has no statistically significant effect on the improvement of the visual acuity and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographic findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients with CMO </plain></SENT>
