<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The etiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is uncertain but there is strong evidence that the immune system is implicated in its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed circulating immune complexes (CIC) in peripheral blood of 34 patients with BD, forming eight clinical groups, using a laser nephelometer to obtain more insight in the pathogenesis of different clinical forms of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy controls and eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> were also included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of CIC were significantly higher in patients (1.83 +/- 0.93 microgram/mL) than in controls (0.84 +/- 0.51 microgram/mL; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High titers were found in the groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum (3.14 +/- 0.44 microgram/mL), neurologic manifestations (2.9 +/- 0.58 microgram/mL), and ocular manifestations (2.34 +/- 0.93 microgram/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulcerations</z:e> (1.91 +/- 0.77 microgram/mL), the mean value of CIC in patients with BD did not differ significantly, but the groups of patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>, and neurologic manifestations had significantly higher levels (P &lt; 0.05) and the group of patients at the mild end of the spectrum (group 8) had a significantly lower level (1.09 +/- 0.41 microgram/mL) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the groups having <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e>, and neurologic manifestations had significantly higher levels of CIC when compared to other groups lacking these clinical features, whereas group 8 had a significantly lower level (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results show that CIC may be involved in the pathogenesis of BD, especially in those clinical forms of the disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum, neurologic manifestations, and ocular manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients at the mild end of the BD spectrum do not show significant changes in CIC levels compared to healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We can, therefore, suggest that in BD CIC may be implicated more in the pathogenesis of some features than of others </plain></SENT>
