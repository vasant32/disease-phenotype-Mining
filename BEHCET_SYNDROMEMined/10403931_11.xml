<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the peripheral T cell repertoire was analysed in patients with BD with MoAbs against T cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta gene products in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments, and these were compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) patients and healthy controls (HC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the CD4+ T cell compartment, oligoclonal TCR Vbeta expression was observed in 56% of BD (10/18), 71% of RA (5/7) patients and 21% (3/14) of HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the CD8+ T cell group 50% of BD (9/18), 57% of RA patients and 28% of HC (4/14) had an oligoclonal TCR repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase of TCR Vbeta5.1 subset was observed in five BD patients among CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other elevations of TCR Vbeta subsets were heterogeneously distributed with one to three different Vbeta subsets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest an antigen-driven oligoclonal increase of T cells in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no overall increase in any Vbeta group to suggest a superantigen effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the responsible antigens causing the increase in T cell subsets may give insights into the aetiopathogenesis of BD and immunomodulation of these T cells may lead to new treatments </plain></SENT>
