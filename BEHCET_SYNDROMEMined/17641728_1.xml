<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 20 healthy control subjects were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While 27 patients had ocular involvement (18 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, 9 had inactive ocular involvement), 30 did not have ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and serum leptin levels were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and control group for both logarithm of leptin (P = .000) and logarithm of CRP (P = .031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logarithm of leptin in non-ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients was significantly higher compared to its level in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and controls (P = .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference between the patients with active ocular disease and control group (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Leptin might have a possible role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
