<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of infliximab in the treatment of sight-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and extraocular manifestations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were treated with infliximab after unsuccessful therapy with other immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were as follows: the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> relapses, the number of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease-related extraocular lesions, and the amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> administered during the treatment as well as during an equal prior period of time while the patients were on other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was recorded at the beginning of infliximab therapy and at the end of follow-up, and was defined as stable if it did not change from baseline, increased if it showed at least one line of improvement from baseline, and decreased if it showed at least a one line decrease from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 16.67 +/- 7.63 months (median, 15 months), 11 patients (91.6%) showed a reduction in the number of ocular relapses (relapse/month, from 0.35 +/- 0.17 to 0.12 +/- 0.17, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients (n = 11) who were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> before infliximab were able to reduce the amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> taken daily during infliximab treatment (from 24.33 +/- 10.84 mg/prednisone per day to 8.97 +/- 6.81 mg/prednisone per day, P &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presented with a reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of extraocular manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (mean total number, from 2.83 +/- 3.61 to 1.51 +/- 2.35, P = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient, who had to stop treatment 2 months after starting because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e>, showed the same number of relapses during infliximab treatment but was able to reduce the mean daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity increased by one or more lines in three eyes (12.5%) and remained unchanged in 87.5% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infliximab-related side effects appeared in four patients (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab was effective in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in these <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients, significantly reducing the number of ocular relapses and making possible a significant reduction in the daily dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extraocular manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were also controlled by infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, side effects were not uncommon, and an extensive study of systemic conditions before infliximab administration had to be carried out to exclude <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e>, particularly prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
