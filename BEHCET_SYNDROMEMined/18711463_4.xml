<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of 120 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> due to BD followed at the National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, from 1962 to 2004, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the time of follow-up: the first group was followed from 1962 until 1972, the second group from 1983 until 1992, and the third group from 1992 through 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Snellen visual acuity was converted to logMAR values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The range of values for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was 0.5 (trace), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 45 patients (89 affected eyes) in the 1960s group, 26 patients (52 eyes) in the 1980s group, and 49 patients (94 eyes) in the most recent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that the mean logMAR score decreased with each decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean visual acuity in the 1990s group was significantly better than in the previous decades (p &lt; 0.001 for the 1960s group and p = 0.019 for the 1980s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score was significantly higher in the 1960s than in the subsequent decades (p &lt; 0.001 both for the 1980s and for the 1990s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: BD is a severe, blinding disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a definitive trend toward improvement in clinical outcome from the 1960s to 1990s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We attribute this trend to the introduction of newer, more potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-sparing agents and targeted therapy </plain></SENT>
