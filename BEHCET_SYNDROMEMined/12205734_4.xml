<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Esophageal involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is very rare, and normally is observed as aphtosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100633'>esophagitis</z:hpo>, but serious complications such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath>, and stenosis may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out this prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of esophageal involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and to establish if routine endoscopy and/or manometry are necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the international study group for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None were taking drugs or had disease that might produce esophageal abnormalities or alter any existing changes due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty- three patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy by a single observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsies were performed in thirteen patients and esophageal manometry in twenty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the beginning of the study, the disease activity was defined by the presence of more than one symptom related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, and upon the classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the twenty three patients enrolled two were excluded from final analysis because of the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatus hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, 13 men and 8 women, ranging in age from 20 to 63 years with a mean age of 36.2 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (47.6%) had active disease and four (19%) complained of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper gastrointestinal symptoms</z:e> at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had endoscopic, manometric and/or microscopic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Esophageal manometry was performed in twenty patients and was abnormal in 7 cases (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Esophageal biopsies were done in 13 patients and revealed histopathological abnormalities in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microscopic findings showed vasculities in one case, and non-specific inflammatory infiltration mainly consisting of neutrophils in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the prevalence of esophageal involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> is rather high and occur even in asymptomatic patients, but that this usually does not result in specific abnormalities </plain></SENT>
