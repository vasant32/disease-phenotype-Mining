<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A series of 47 overlapping synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (15ers) derived from the sequence of the Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> 65 kDa <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> was used in ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in IgA and IgG antibody levels were observed with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> 111-125, 154-172 and 311-326 in sera from BD, compared with those from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Homologous <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> derived from the sequence of the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> 60 kDa <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> were then examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> 136-150 and 336-351 showed comparable results to the homologous mycobacterial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> 111-125 and 311-326, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> defined in this investigation overlap with the T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> the authors have previously reported in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhibition studies are consistent with the view that antibodies to each of the three B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> represent a small proportion of the total B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> repertoire elicited by the 65 or 60 kD <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential antibody studies suggest that IgA and IgG antibody titres to one or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> tested may increase during exacerbation of ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The functional role of these antibodies needs to be determined, but the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of BD as they can induce experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in Lewis rats, which is a principal manifestation of BD </plain></SENT>
