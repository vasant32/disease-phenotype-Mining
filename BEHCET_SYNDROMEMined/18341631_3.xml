<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) (P &lt; 0.001) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels (P = 0.022) were significantly higher in 79 patients than in 84 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in CPB2 (TAFI) Thr325Ile and SERPINE1 (PAI1) 4G/5G polymorphism distribution between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TAFI activity levels were significantly higher in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than in those without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the increased TAFI levels in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease could contribute to the increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
