<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two consecutive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease patients who were initially diagnosed according to clinical judgement, and 56 control patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, were recruited from the rheumatology out-patient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had their charts reviewed, were interviewed and clinically examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Various models including different combinations of the six diagnostic criteria were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the model that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the information gathered, the International (sensitivity = 0.95, specificity = 1.00), Japanese (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity - 0.95) and Mason &amp; Barnes criteria (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.94) were the most accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinician judgement also performed very well in identifying a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease case (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The International, Japanese and Mason &amp; Barnes criteria were the most accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latent class method led to these conclusions without making any initial assumptions about the accuracy of any of the competing criteria (including clinical judgement) </plain></SENT>
