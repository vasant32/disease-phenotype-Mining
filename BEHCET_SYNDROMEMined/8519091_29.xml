<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 72 Turkish patients (33 female, 39 male) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in order to investigate the prevalence of antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECA) and to examine their possible relationship with clinical and laboratory features of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from 30 healthy Turkish people were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured and used unfixed in a cellular ELISA to detect AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IgG and/or IgM AECA were found in 13 (18.1%) patients but not in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antiendothelial cell antibodies did not induce complement-mediated cytotoxicity as assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay and the binding was not due to immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic events and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> at the time of the AECA assay among patients with AECA were significantly higher than those in patients without AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory parameters of active disease were higher in patients with AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between other clinical and laboratory features of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative in our series, excluding a possibility of cross-reaction with AECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a possible role of AECA in association with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
