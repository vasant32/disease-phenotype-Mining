<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient presents a characteristic triad: apparently <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015480" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">factitious disorders</z:e>, migration from hospital to hospital resulting in unnecessary explorations and treatments, and fabulated medical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old man was hospitalized in the psychiatric unit for alleged <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, psychomotor excitation and multiple hallucinatory phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The factitious nature of the patient��s condition was rapidly suspected in light of the large number of previous unconfirmed medical conditions and a rather unbelievable history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Unlike the classical description of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026785" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Munchausen's syndrome</z:e>, this patient had no history of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unusual aspect should not exclude the clinical diagnosis as for some patients, the invasive nature of certain explorations may be a valid substitute for surgery </plain></SENT>
