<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several proteins are investigated as candidate auto-antigens in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to screen the cellular responses to auto-antigen (alphaB-crystallin, alphaBC), and microorganism (Streptococcus sangius KTH-1 BES-1 protein) derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> as well as to isopentenyl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">pyrophosphate</z:chebi> (IPP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 22 BD patients and 22 healthy controls (HC) were stimulated in vitro with alphaBC, <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>-1 peptides, IPP and <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> and induced proliferation as well as the secreted interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma production levels were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any significant difference in cellular proliferation between BD patients and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Induction of IL-12 secretion with alphaBC was stronger in BD patients (P = 0.04) and in the disease subgroup with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.027) compared the HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When responses to <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> were compared, proliferation of PMBC was lower (P = 0.03), whereas IL-12 secretion was higher in BD (P = 0.04) as well as in patients under colchicum treatment (P = 0.04) and with vascular involvement (P = 0.006) compared to HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>-1(373-385 )<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> induced also higher IL-12 productions by PBMC of BD patients (P = 0.017) and of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, IPP stimulated higher IL-12 secretions from PBMC in BD patients (P = 0.035) and in patients with (P = 0.02) or without (P = 0.017) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (P = 0.04), under colchicum treatment (P = 0.01) or not receiving any immunosuppressive treatment (P = 0.007) compared to HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a more prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from PBMC in BD patients compared to HC in response to various antigens including alphaBC protein, <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>-1(373-385), IPP and <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
