<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study autoantibody formation in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) who received long-term treatment with the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serial sera from infliximab-treated patients (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 4, 8, and every 6-8 weeks thereafter) were tested for various autoantibodies, using commercially available methods, at baseline and at 6 months (n = 20), at 12 months (n = 16), and at 18 months post-baseline (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five age- and sex-matched BD patients, not treated with infliximab, served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Autoantibodies were rarely seen in controls, as well as in infliximab treated patients at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> (ANA) at low titers was evident in 13/20 (65%) patients at 6 months post-baseline; one additional patient developed anti-beta2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I IgM antibodies (anti-beta(2)GPI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 ANA-positive sera, low titers-IgM of anti-dsDNA or anti-beta(2)GPI were detected in 7 (35%) and 6 (30%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional measurements at 12 and 18 months showed that the persistence and/or increasing titers of these autoantibodies depended on continuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (anti-RNP, anti-SS-A/Ro, anti-SS-B/La, anti-Sm), rheumatoid factors, anti-cyclic citrullinated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, were never detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No antibody-related symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>-like disease, or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were observed in any patient up to 18 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early induction of ANA and specific autoantibodies is common in BD patients treated with infliximab, including low titers of non-pathogenic anti-dsDNA and anti-Beta&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt;GPI antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A possible clinical significance of these findings needs to be documented in further studies, including more patients and longer follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
