<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of combined low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (Cs/Pd) treatment on circulating CD56+ T cells in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and 10 healthy control subjects were prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with Cs/Pd for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic and functional changes in circulating CD56+ T cells were assayed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD56+ T-cell subsets were determined by flow cytometric analysis with monoclonal antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, pan gammadelta TCR, and Valpha24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absolute numbers of cells in the lymphocyte subsets were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytokine (IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10) expressions were measured by ELISA and by intracellular cytokine staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of CD56+ T cells, specifically CD8highCD56+ and CD56+gammadelta T-cell subsets, were significantly higher in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> but normalized after treatment, whereas the total T-lymphocyte count and the absolute numbers of CD56- T cells were unaffected by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4 were elevated in aqueous humor and serum in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001), whereas IL-10 was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment, serum IL-4 levels markedly increased (P &lt; 0.001), and IFN-gamma production by circulating CD56+ T cells was then suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-4 and -10 production by CD56+ T cells was increased by treatment, but in contrast, minimal changes were found in CD56- T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that Cs/Pd treatment for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> selectively affects the population of and the cytokine expression in CD56+ T cells, but without significant changes in CD56- T cells, and that IFN-gamma-producing CD56+ T cells are the central pathogenic immune cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
