<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A unifying feature of BD <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is the skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> reaction (SPR), a nonspecific tissue hyperreactivity to minor trauma involving epithelial disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared skin responses to needle prick in BD patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two study groups, each consisting of 10 BD patients with SPR(+) and 6 controls, were evaluated using either immunohistochemistry or quantitative real-time PCR to measure inflammatory cell and cytokine levels in biopsy specimens obtained serially from independent sites at 0, 8, and 48 h after needle prick </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found similar cellular infiltration patterns in response to needle prick in BD patients and controls between 0 and 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further development of this immune response was limited in skin of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects, with stable or decreased <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> observed at 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in BD-derived skin specimens, increased influxes of mature dendritic cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes, including T regulatory cells, were noted by 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, increases in cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12 p40, IL-15), chemokines (MIP3-alpha, IP-10, Mig, and iTac), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) were noted at 48 h in the skin of BD patients with SPR(+) but not in the skin of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, in contrast to the self-limited <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> associated with epithelial disruption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin, BD patients experience marked cellular influxes into the injury site, leading to an exaggerated lymphoid Th1-type response </plain></SENT>
