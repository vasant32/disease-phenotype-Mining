<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the immune system in 18 cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD69+ cells in CD4+ cells was significantly higher in patients with active uveoretinitis than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After OKT-3 stimulation of cultured cells, the proportion was significantly increased in controls (p &lt; 0.01) but not in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fas-ligand positive cells in CD8+ cells in patients did not increase after OKT-3 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the T cells in patients were in an activated state in vivo but were not further activated by OKT-3 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cultured lymphocytes of patients after OPT-3 activation and anti-Fas antibody stimulation showed that the T cells in the active stage of the disease were resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and unlikely to undergo regression by activation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (AICD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean level of soluble Fas antigen was significantly elevated in sera of patients with active uveoretinitis as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TdT-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive infiltrating cells were present in the inflamed retina and the posterior chamber in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) in rats, suggesting the involvement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of infiltrated cells in the regression of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was significantly elevated after 9 days of immunization in rats (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> score was suppressed by intravenous administration of anti-TNF-alpha antibody from days 7 to 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is associated with activation of T cells and abnormality in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and AICD mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Systemic anti-TNF-alpha antibody promises to be of value in the treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
