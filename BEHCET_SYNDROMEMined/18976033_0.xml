<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the possible relation between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level and ocular involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients who fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (96 females and 54 males) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were evaluated carefully by an experienced ophthalmologist for the diagnosis of ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were categorized according to the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data were statistically analyzed by using Student's t-test and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty- nine patients (39.3%) had eye involvement, which included <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vitritis</z:e>, macular damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> were comparable in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level in patients with and without eye involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level does not have significant effect on eye involvement in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
