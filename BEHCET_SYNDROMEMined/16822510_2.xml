<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether human monocytes can also acquire the specific functions by TGF-beta2 treatment, even when the monocytes are isolated from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adherent monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 16 BD patients and 16 healthy controls, were cultured overnight with or without 5 ng/ml of TGF-beta2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, TGF-beta2-treated or untreated adherent cells were co-cultured with allogeneic CD4(+) T cells obtained from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TGF-beta2 treatment inhibited the abilities of adherent monocytes obtained from BD patients to stimulate the proliferation and IFN-gamma production of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduced IFN-gamma production was also confirmed by IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the co-cultured T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-12 production and CD40 molecule expression by adherent monocytes obtained from BD patients were strikingly reduced by TGF-beta2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a possibility that adherent monocytes isolated from BD patients may acquire a property to induce ACAID by treatment with TGF-beta2 </plain></SENT>
