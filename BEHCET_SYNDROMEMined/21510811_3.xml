<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to investigate in vivo and in vitro production of interferon (IFN)-γ and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) during <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (BU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we evaluated the implication of IFN-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 in the regulation of NO production in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytokines' concentrations were measured by ELISA, and NO levels were assessed by modified Griess's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that patients with active disease had significant elevation of IFN-γ and NO concentrations in both plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants compared with controls (P&lt;0.01) or to patients with inactive disease (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, IFN-γ induced significantly higher production of NO in cell culture supernatants, whereas IL-10 significantly reduced it (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the elevated levels of IFN-γ in vivo and in vitro in patients with BU reflect the implication of this cytokine in the disease physiopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IFN-γ, through the induction of NO synthase 2 and the production of NO, is implicated in the genesis of the inflammatory process during active BU; whereas IL-10 seems to have protective properties </plain></SENT>
