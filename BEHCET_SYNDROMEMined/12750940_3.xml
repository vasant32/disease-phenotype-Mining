<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apart from being involved in fibrinolysis and thrombolysis, the plasminogen activation system can contribute to the pathogenesis of destructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a well known fibrinolysis inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, local synovial fluid and circulating plasma PAI-1 concentrations of BD were assessed in comparison to RA patients and healthy controls to investigate the nonerosive, nondestructive nature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with BD (mean age 34+/-11 years, males:females 6:6), 15 with RA (mean age 36+/-8 years, males:females 3:12), and 15 healthy adults (mean age 32+/-10 years, males:females 6:9) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma PAI-1 antigen levels and PAI-1 activities were significantly greater in BD patients than in RA patients and healthy controls ( P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Synovial fluid levels of both parameters were also higher than in RA patients ( P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PAI-1 may promote hypofibrinolysis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's vasculopathy and also have a protective role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> of BD </plain></SENT>
