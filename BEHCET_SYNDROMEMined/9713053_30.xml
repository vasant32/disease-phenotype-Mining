<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients were treated with IFN alpha 2a for a mean of 23.6 months (14-37 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They received an initial dose of IFN alpha 2a of 6 x 10(6) IU/day, followed by 3 x 10(6) IU/day after 1 month and 3 x 10(6) IU every other day after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients received low dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/body weight) additionally at the beginning of the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete cessation of IFN alpha 2a was possible in three patients (observation period 22, 6, and 4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked improvement occurred in six patients who had ocular manifestations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease for the first time or with minor damage during their course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient with advanced ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, new relapses were prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> infiltrates resolved within 2 weeks; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, infiltration of the anterior chamber and vitreous resolved within 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> score before treatment (nine affected eyes) was 6.6, 4 weeks after IFN it was reduced to 0.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean observation period is 27.6 months, ranging from 14 to 42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment of ocular symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with IFN alpha 2a alone or in combination with low dose steroids led to complete remission of ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated in this open, uncontrolled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment with IFN alpha 2a may prevent permanent <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> or optic nerve damage due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No severe side effects occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Controlled randomised studies are warranted in order to prove the efficacy of IFN alpha 2a in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and to compare it with other, established treatments such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
