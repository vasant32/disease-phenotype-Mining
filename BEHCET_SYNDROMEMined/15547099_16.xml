<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the type of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) involvement (parenchymal disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT)) and extra-cranial large vessel events, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Conventional venous angiograms, Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were used to study 88 patients with BS, with (n = 88) and without (n = 80) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease for the presence of major vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Major vessel involvement among the male patients with and without <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease (21/73 (29%) v 18/80 (23%), respectively) showed no significant differences (p = 0.374) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease were stratified according to the type of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement, 7/11 (64%) patients with CVT had major vessel disease compared with 15/77 (19%) patients with parenchymal disease (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean (SD) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of CVT (23.1 (8.8) years) among the male patients was significantly earlier than among the men with parenchymal disease (32.0 (7.5); p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CVT in BS was strongly associated with peripheral major vessel disease and occurred earlier in the disease course than the parenchymal type of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> also occurs more frequently in patients with major vessel disease in BS, this may suggest a common pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
