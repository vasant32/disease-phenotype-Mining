<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme activities were found to be significantly high in the aqueous humor of the patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but not detectable in those with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>, and maxillar <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that cathepsin B and collagenolytic cathepsin have a certain role in the inflammatory collagenolytic process of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
