<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Saliva, as a part of the innate immune response, contains antimicrobial <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMPs</z:chebi>) that are derived from both oral epithelial cells and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between salivary levels of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMPs</z:chebi> HNP 1-3, LL-37 and S100 and disease course in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-three patients with BD and 44 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disease severity score reflecting organ involvement was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Salivary HNP 1-3, LL-37 and S100 levels were measured in unstimulated saliva samples by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Salivary HNP 1-3 and S100 levels in BD patients (2715.2 ± 1333.4 μg/ml and 430.6 ± 203.9 ng/ml) were significantly higher compared to HC (1780.6 ± 933.2 μg/ml and 365.3 ± 84.7 ng/ml) (p = 0.000 and p = 0.004, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although LL-37 levels were also higher in BD than HC (190.9 ± 189.1 vs 143.1 ± 128.9 ng/ml), no significant difference was observed (p = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Salivary HNP 1-3 and LL-37 levels were associated with the severity of BD (mild disease: 1975.1 ± 1174.2 μg/ml and 115.9 ± 109.4 ng/ml vs severe disease: 2955.7 ± 1305.6 μg/ml and 215.3 ± 203.8 ng/ml, p=0.020 and p=0.031, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Salivary LL-37 levels also correlated with the number of monthly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> (r = 0.5 p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An increase in salivary HNP 1-3 and S100 levels might be associated with enhanced local and systemic innate responses in BD </plain></SENT>
