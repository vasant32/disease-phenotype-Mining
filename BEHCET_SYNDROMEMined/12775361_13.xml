<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 35 active (n=17) or inactive (n=18) patients with BD (16 men, 19 women) satisfying International Study Group criteria, and 20 age-matched and sex-matched controls (nine men, 11 women) were included in this cross-sectional case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD and TBARS were measured in plasma, catalase in red blood cells (RBC), and SOD and GSHPx in both plasma and RBC in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> phase reactants (alpha(1)-antitrypsin, alpha(2)-macroglobulin, neutrophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were used to classify patients as active or inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma AD (mean+/-standard error of the mean, 36.1+/-0.7 U/l) and TBARS (4.2+/-0.1 nmol/ml) levels were significantly (for each, p&lt;0.001) higher in BD than in controls (24.1+/-0.8 U/l and 1.6+/-0.1 nmol/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RBC catalase activity was significantly (p&lt;0.001) lower in BD than in controls (120.9+/-3.8 versus 160.3+/-4.1 k/g <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SOD and GSHPx activities were significantly lower in both plasma and erythrocytes of patients with BD than in controls (plasma SOD, 442.4+/-8.6 versus 636.4+/-9.2 U/ml, p&lt;0.001; RBC SOD, 3719.2+/-66.0 versus 4849.7+/-49.0 U/g <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, p&lt;0.001; plasma GSHPx, 73.1+/-1.5 versus 90.6+/-2.9 U/ml, p&lt;0.001; RBC GSHPx, 600.7+/-8.0 versus 670.6+/-10.1 U/g <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Active BD patients had significantly lower <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes (except RBC catalase) and higher AD and TBARS levels than inactive subjects (for each, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BD patients, a significant positive correlation was present between AD and TBARS (p&lt;0.001) whereas both AD and TBARS were negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes (for each, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AD and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation are increased and associated with defective <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> in BD, suggesting interactions between activated T cells and neutrophil hyperfunction </plain></SENT>
