<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients and 56 controls were recruited prospectively from the outpatient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> clinic at the Escola Paulista de Medicina between July 1991 and July 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was diagnosed using one of the accepted sets of criteria (Japanese Committee, International Committee, O'Duffy, Mason &amp; Barnes, and James) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control patients, who had other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, were matched on age and sex with the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate environmental factors, a standardized questionnaire was administered to each subject during an interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory investigations were performed in each subject according to a predefined protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (Cochran's restriction) disclosed significant associations between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus type 1 infection or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">streptococcal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size, our data strongly support a role of infectious agents in the etiopathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies in larger patient populations are needed to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
