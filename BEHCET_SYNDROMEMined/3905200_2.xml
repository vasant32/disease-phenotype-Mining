<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have recently investigated two patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysms</z:hpo>, one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan's syndrome</z:e> and the other with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial diagnosis in both cases was made by ultrasound, but CT was inconclusive and aortography was contraindicated in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging was performed to see if further information could be obtained </plain></SENT>
