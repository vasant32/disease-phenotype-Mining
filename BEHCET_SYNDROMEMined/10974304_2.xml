<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum prolactin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 17 patients with ocular findings, and 20 patients without ocular findings of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and in 17 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average prolactin levels were measured as 9.53 ng/mL in patients with ocular findings, 8.84 ng/mL in patients without ocular findings, and 9.59 ng/mL in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical significance among these three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, the average levels were 9.84 ng/mL in remission periods and 7.54 ng/mL in attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In some studies, it has been suggested there is a correlation between high serum prolactin levels and activation of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found no such correlation in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, prolactin levels were lower in attacks than in remissions </plain></SENT>
