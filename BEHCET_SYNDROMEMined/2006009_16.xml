<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 3 different stages of imaging appearance: (1) During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illness, there were scattered areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with predilection to the central structures of the cerebrum, the cerebral peduncles, and basis pontis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) During the recovery phase, most of these findings improved, but some white matter high signal areas persisted in the upper brainstem and peripheral subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, findings were suggestive of microhematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of posterior fossa structures became evident with decreased signal intensity suggestive of hemosiderin deposits </plain></SENT>
