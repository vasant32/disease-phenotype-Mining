<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interferon (IFN)-alpha which has an ability to promote strong Th1 type immune response has been shown to increase in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to clarify if plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) abnormally respond to a stimulus in patients with BD, we investigated the levels of intracellular IFN-alpha and beta in pDCs with or without CpG D ODN stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study population consisted of 8 patients with clinically active BD, 8 ankylosing spondilitis (AS) patients having active disease and 11 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pDC subsets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) cultures were analysed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:The percentage of IFN-alpha+ pDCs in unstimulated PBMCs cultures from patients BD was significantly higher (p=0.036) than in AS and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But this difference disappeared in stimulated PBMCs cultures (p=0.167) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFN-alpha+ pDCs in stimulated PBMCs cultures of BD patients was significantly higher than those from patients with AS and HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of IFN-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30225">beta+</z:chebi> pDCs in unstimulated PBMCs cultures from patients with BD and AS was significantly higher (p=0.004) than in HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But this difference was not significant in stimulated PBMCs cultures (p=0.694) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When compared to healthy subjects, the MFI of IFN-beta + pDCs in unstimulated and stimulated PBMCs cultures from patients with BD and AS was not different (p=0.287, p=0.152, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with BD, the percentage and MFI of IFN-alpha+ pDCs were higher (p=0.012 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) in stimulated PBMCs cultures as compared to unstimulated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that increased frequency of IFN-alpha+ pDC in BD patients and the higher sensitiveness of these cells to CpG D ODN stimulus contribute to high serum IFN-alpha levels found in these patients which eventually resulted in Th1 type immune response </plain></SENT>
