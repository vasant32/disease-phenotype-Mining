<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> has been described as one cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> (AR), clinical features of this disease entity have not been fully characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 153 consecutive patients (103 male), who underwent open-heart operation to correct predominant AR from January 1990 to December 2000 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 16 patients (10%) were found to have AR associated with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>; there were 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> (TA) and 7 with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with TA, but only 3 with BD, were female (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed redundant motion of the elongated aortic cusp with the frequent periaortic echo-free space in BD, and characteristic motion limitation of thickened cusp with dilated and thickened aorta in TA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with TA, but only 1 patient with BD, were given a diagnosis before operation (P &lt;.05); the others underwent emergency operation to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AR of unknown etiology, and were given a correct diagnosis after detection of paravalvular leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In TA, paravalvular leakage developed in 1 patient (11%) and another died suddenly with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In BD, paravalvular leakage developed in 6 patients (86%) who needed repeated operation, and 2 died even after the third operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 2-year survival without clinical events (paravalvular leakage, repeated operation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was 76 +/- 15% in TA and 14 +/- 13% in BD (P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TA and BD are 2 important causes of AR, and show different clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high rate of paravalvular leakage, especially in BD, warrants cautious systemic evaluations for the cause of AR, and characteristic echocardiographic findings seem to be helpful in the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
