<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to describe the macroscopic features of early untreated knee <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> in BD and PsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen consecutive patients with active early knee <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> (seven BD and seven PsA) undergoing rheumatologic arthroscopy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following macroscopic synovial features were evaluated and scored by analyzing the video recordings of each procedure: capillary hyperaemia, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo>, vascular pattern, fibrinoid membranes, and topographic distribution of these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Video-recording of 35 early untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> patients with different diagnoses were also studied looking for BD-like macroscopic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six out of seven BD patients had extensive fibrinoid membranes and large areas of erythematous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> without villi or a distinctive vascular pattern, while PsA patients had diffuse erythematous villous <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> with a tortuous vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 35 patients with early untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the characteristic features of BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This exploratory study shows some distinctive features between BD and PsA knee <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> that confirm macroscopic differences in patients with previously reported immunopathological differences </plain></SENT>
