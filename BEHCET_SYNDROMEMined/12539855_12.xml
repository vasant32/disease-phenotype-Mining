<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the long-term use of low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> (CsA) which is a potent immunomodulatory agent in the treatment of ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two patients (104 eyes) with ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease using CsA for at least 1 year were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients underwent complete ophthalmological and systemic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five mg/kg/per day CsA was started to the patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> and/or frequent anterior inflammatory attacks unresponsive to the conventional therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to ocular response and adverse effects, the dose was tapered gradually over 2 months to a maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg/per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">Prednisone</z:chebi> (0.2-0.8 mg/kg/per day) was added when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-six of the patients (88.5%) were males and six (11.5%) were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 33.65 +/- 7.75 (range, 19-53) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean ocular involvement period was 64.1 (range, 12-180) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>Posterior uveitis</z:hpo> was present in 49 (94.21%) and severe, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> in three (5.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean CsA administration period was 38 +/- 18.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity improved in 31(29.8%), deteriorated in 32 (30.8%) and unchanged in 41(39.4%) of the 104 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No ocular attacks occurred in 50% of the eyes during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nine (17.3%) of the patients had to stop the therapy because of the adverse effects of the CsA and the others tolerated well for a long-term period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CsA is not the ideal therapeutic agent in ocular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease because it can not completely eliminate the disease, but it is currently one of the most effective and efficient drug to control the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and its complications until better treatment modalities are developed </plain></SENT>
