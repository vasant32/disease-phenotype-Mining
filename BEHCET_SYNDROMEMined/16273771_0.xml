<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the pathogenesis of this response, the effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e> on in vitro oxidative burst reaction of neutrophils and monocytes were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (BS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA), familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) and healthy controls (HC) were incubated with 100 ng/ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e> at different dosages (25-500 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidative burst reaction was evaluated in neutrophils and monocytes by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with BS, oxidative burst of neutrophils was significantly increased compared to HC at 125 microg/ml and 250 microg/ml dosages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e> (p &lt; or = 0.001 and 0.004 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>; there was also an increased oxidative burst reaction at 75 microg/ml, 250 g/ml and 500 microg/ml (p &lt; or = 0.007; 0.001 and 0.004 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with BS, oxidative burst of monocytes was increased only at 125 g/ml dosage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e> (p &lt; or = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> monocyte burst response was increased at 25 microg/ml, 75 microg/ml and 125 g/ml (p &lt; or = 0.004; &lt; 0.0001; &lt; 0.0001 and 0.002 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In RA group, stimulation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> resulted in a higher oxidative burst reaction than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> and BS (p &lt; or = 0.000 and p &lt; or = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between oxidative burst of neutrophils or monocytes and intradermal responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e> crystals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oxidative burst reaction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSU</z:e> is augmented in neutrophils and monocytes of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the response is not specific and is unassociated with skin dermal test which has a high specificity for BS </plain></SENT>
