<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has been postulated that a dysregulation of the prooxidant/<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> balance may be important to its pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ceruloplasmin (CP) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase protein expressed at the surface of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties and with a relevant role in iron (Fe) metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study CP expression at the surface of PBL (PBLCP) in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We measured serum CP and PBLCP obtained from BD patients (n=10) and respective controls (n=10) using nephelometry and flow cytometry techniques, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, haematological parameters, biochemical Fe metabolism markers [serum Fe, serum ferritin, serum transferrin, total Fe binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation] and non-specific markers of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> [serum C reactive protein (CRP), beta2-microglobulin] were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite the absence of significant differences between the two study groups when comparing serum CP, a significant difference in PBLCP was found in BD patients mainly due to a significant decrease of CP expression at the surface of CD3-CD56+ lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, a significant decrease of PBLCP was observed in patients treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> compared to patients that were not being treated with this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, we suggest that the significant decrease of PBLCP observed in BD patients might be due to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> treatment and not directly related to the pathophysiology of BD </plain></SENT>
