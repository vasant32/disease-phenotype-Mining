<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen BD patients with ocular complications (BDo), including 11 BD patients with ocular attack (BDa) and eight BD patients with inactive ocular complications (BDi), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four BD patients without ocular complications (BDwo) were also evaluated as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively followed by our outpatient clinic between autumn 2004 and spring 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD4+ CD25+bright T cells (Treg cells) from peripheral blood were measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of Treg cells in CD4+ T cells from BDo were significantly decreased before ocular attack compared with those after ocular attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, surprisingly, these levels before attack were significantly lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level, whereas the percentages of Treg cells in both BDi and BDwo patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treg cells were significantly decreased in BDa before active ocular attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Treg cells play an important role in ocular attack in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, decreased percentages of Treg cells may be a predictive marker of ocular attack in BD patients allowing treatment of BD patients before an ocular attack </plain></SENT>
