<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002907'>microscopic hematuria</z:hpo> which was pointed out by urinary mass screening for school children at age of 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As he was subsequently evolved <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, a renal biopsy was performed at age of 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specimen showed diffuse proliferation of mesangial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent studies showed granular deposition of IgA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At age of 17, he showed typical symptoms of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, namely aphthous <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo>, perianal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> nodosum-like lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and genital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038363" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphtha</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore he showed an increasing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and an impairment of his renal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum IgA level and immune complexes during the exacerbation stage were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> markedly improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> A therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and improvement of renal function were simultaneously observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings may suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000794'>IgA nephropathy</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's a disease have common immunological pathogenesis, including circulating immune complexes </plain></SENT>
