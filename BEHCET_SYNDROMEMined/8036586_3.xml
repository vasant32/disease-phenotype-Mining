<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients group was multinational, of them 19 were Caucasoids and 4 Mongoloids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that HLA B5 in Caucasoids occurred more frequently vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (73.7% and 15.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the correction of the antigens number up to 21, the differences continued to be statistically high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristic for B5 antigen was a high relative risk and close association with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In antigen group B5 + B35 the relative risk and association power grew still higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The B5 positive group statistically more frequently had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and less frequently gastrointestinal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that class 1 HLA antigens, B5 in particular, are closely associated with BD in CIS countries </plain></SENT>
