<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A receptor which binds secretory IgA (sIgA) is expressed on human T cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000794'>IgA nephropathy</z:hpo> and on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells following phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The specificity of this receptor was initially probed with a panel of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum immunoglobulins in competitive inhibition assays with sIgA using two-colour immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the receptor showed the strongest affinity for IgA1 (IC(50)10(-6) M), IgD which has a similarly glycosylated hinge region to IgA1, also bound to the receptor (IC50 10(-5) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IgA2, which lacks the 'O'-glycosylated hinge region, did not significantly inhibit the binding at these concentrations suggesting that the IgA determinants for this receptor might be the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> present in the hinge region of IgA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IgA1 has up to 10 'O'-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> and four N-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> per molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to probe the role of the 'O'-linked hinge <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> in the binding event, a sugar library was prepared from IgA1 by a procedure designed to release 'O'-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> preferentially, and to retain them in the natural closed ring formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> were released by hydrazinolysis at 65 degrees and the resulting <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> library analysed by high voltage paper electrophoresis (HVE) and P4 gel permeation chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that both the library and the individual 'O'-linked <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> associated with IgA1 were implicated in the binding of IgA1 to this receptor (IC50 between 1 x 10(-5) M and 6 x 10(-5) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within this range the individual <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi> showed small differences in their affinity for the receptor in the following order: <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> beta 3GalNAc = NeuNAc2 alpha 3(6)<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> beta 3GalNAc &gt; NeuNAc2 alpha 3(6)<z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> beta 3[NeuNAc2 alpha 6]GalNAc &gt; or = GalNAc </plain></SENT>
