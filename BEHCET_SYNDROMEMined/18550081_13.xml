<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown the beneficial effect of infliximab in ocular manifestation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current studies examined the efficacy of infliximab in progressive neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome (NB) refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five male patients with progressive NB with sustained elevation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6 (over 20 pg/ml) despite administration of MTX and steroid, were given intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 with MTX (10-17.5 mg/week) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (&lt;10 mg/day) at the same doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical responses were judged by neuropsychiatric findings, revised Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS-R), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 5 patients, CSF IL-6 were markedly decreased by 1/2-1/37 on the next day of the first infusion and remained below 20 pg/ml before the last infusion at 14 weeks, whereas CSF TNF-alpha were not significantly changed at any time point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 weeks from the initial infusion, none of the 5 patients showed exacerbation (3 patients significantly improved) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nor did the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in midbrain, pons and medulla on brain MRI scans show significant progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that infliximab might have a beneficial effect in the treatment of progressive NB by reducing CSF IL-6 levels but not TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since infliximab has been shown to have cytotoxic effects on monocytes/macrophages, the rapid fall of CSF IL-6 after the infusion suggest that infliximab might directly act on such inflammatory cells producing IL-6 </plain></SENT>
