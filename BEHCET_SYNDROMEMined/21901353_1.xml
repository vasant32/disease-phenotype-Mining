<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to investigate the association of a certain polymorphism (C438T) of the SUMO4 gene with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) in terms of its incidence and clinical features in Korean patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We consecutively enrolled 83 patients with BD and 120 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a single nucleotide change (C438T) in the SUMO4 gene using an amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To validate the ARMS technique, we compared its results to the results of direct sequencing in 20 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 status was determined by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of papulopustular lesions (P = 0.006) and vascular involvement (P = 0.045) was significantly different between C438T genotypes in HLA-B51-positive patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in allelic or genotypic frequencies of the SUMO4 C438T polymorphism between patients with BD and controls (P = 0.567 and P = 0.818, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference in papulopustular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> between CC and CT + TT genotypes in HLA-B51-positive patients with BD was also statistically significant (P = 0.002, OR = 23.40, 95% CI: 2.33-235.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The C438T polymorphism in the SUMO4 gene is associated with significantly increased risk of papulopustular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in HLA-B51-positive patients </plain></SENT>
