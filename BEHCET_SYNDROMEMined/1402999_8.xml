<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) There was a significant positive correlation between CSF T-N levels and CSF/serum albumin ratios only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, increases of CSF T-N levels were not associated with those of plasma T-N levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> patients, CSF T-N levels remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, although CSF T-B levels significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) A gradient for the CSF T-N value (lumbar greater than ventricular CSF), being reverse to the CSF T-B value, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the significance of CSF T-N is quite different from CSF T-B, and that CSF T-N appears to be a valuable biochemical marker for evaluating the activity of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> within the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
