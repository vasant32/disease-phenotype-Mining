<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16336">Hyaluronic acid</z:chebi> (HA) is a primary component of the extracellular matrix, and the efficacy of HA on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> is rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy and safety of the topical application of 0.2% HA gel on recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> and to compare its effects in patients with recurrent aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (RAU) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three outpatients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were included in the study (17 patients: BD, 16 patients: RAU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients used topical 0.2% HA gel twice daily for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subjective parameters of patients [number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, healing period, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain] were investigated and objective assessments (number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, maximal area of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> and inflammatory signs) were inspected by a physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A subjective reduction in the number of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> was observed in 72.7% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> healing period was observed in 72.7% of the patients; 75.8% experienced improvement in VAS for pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Objective inspection of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> showed a reduction of numbers in 57.6% of the patients, and 78.8% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> showed a decrease in area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the inflammatory signs, swelling and local heat were significantly improved after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the BD group and RAU group in subjective and objective parameters, except for inflammatory signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No side-effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The topical application of 0.2% HA gel seems to be an effective and safe therapy in patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo>; the study supports the use of HA in BD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
