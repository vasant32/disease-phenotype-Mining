<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here an autopsy case of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 28-year-old man, who developed a slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018784" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory neural hearing loss</z:e> at the age of 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These symptoms relapsed repeatedly despite treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eventually he was admitted to hospital because of progressing neurological deficits such as pyramidal symptoms, somatic sensorial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1145628" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic disorders</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's condition deteriorated and he died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total clinical course was about three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In postmortem examination, various-sized necrotic foci, often accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and foamy macrophage infiltration, were scattered in the diencephalic region and brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>Meningitis</z:hpo> was observed on the ventral side of the brain stem as well as inferior cerebral surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonbacterial or non-fungal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> perivascular inflammatory foci were also present in the brain stem and cerebellar parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These histopathological findings suggest that a destructive multifocal neutrophilic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> might have caused the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perivascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> might be important to understanding the pathogenesis of neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
