<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> have been demonstrated in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), the exact mechanism of the inflammatory changes occurring is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antigen-presenting cells, such as mononuclear phagocytes, play a major role in the regulation of immune-mediated as well as of non-specific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the serum activity of patients with BD on antigen and chemokine expression of human macrophages in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum of 15 patients (8 women, 7 men; mean age 33 +/- 10 years) with BD was incubated with cultured macrophages isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macrophages maintained in patients' serum, fetal calf serum with/without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> and interleukin (IL)-4 or gamma-interferon were investigated for alternative macrophage-activation-associated CC-chemokine 1 (AMAC-1) and IL-8 mRNA expression by Northern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, cytocentrifuge macrophage preparations were stained with monoclonal antibodies against proteins indicating alternative (anti-inflammatory) macrophage activation, such as MS-1 high-molecular-weight protein (MS-1-HMWP), RM3/1 antigen (CD163) and 25F9, as well as classical (pro-inflammatory) macrophage activation, such as CD11c, class I receptor binding the Fc part of IgG (FcgammaRI: CD64) and class III receptor binding the Fc part of IgG (FcgammaRIII: CD16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macrophages treated with patients' serum showed neither AMAC-1 expression nor staining with monoclonal antibodies for MS-1-HMWP, CD163 or 25F9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concomitant treatment with IL-4/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> up-regulated significantly the expression of CD163 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-8 mRNA expression and staining for CD11c and CD64 were strongly positive after treatment with serum of patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CD64 positivity and IL-8 mRNA expression were more prominent in patients with active BD than in patients with inactive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate that serum of patients with BD induces classical (pro-inflammatory) activation of human peripheral blood macrophages in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that serum factor(s) may be responsible for inflammatory changes in BD </plain></SENT>
