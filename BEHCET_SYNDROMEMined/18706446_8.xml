<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a multisystem <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> characterised by recurrent orogenital ulceration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> whose aetiology is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that levels of cytokines in the serum might provide either diagnostic or activity markers for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Levels of 10 cytokines were analysed in a multiplex bead analysis system as well as IL-15 by ELISA, in 79 serum samples from 52 patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same cytokines were also measured in serum samples from 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011107'>recurrent aphthous stomatitis</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp>), as disease controls, and 15 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with disease activity and current drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CXCL8 and TNF were the most abundant cytokines and were significantly raised compared to both patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-15 was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples and was significantly raised in both patients with BD and <z:mp ids='MP_0011356'>RAS</z:mp> compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By comparison, cytokines associated with an adaptive immune response such as IFNgamma and IL-2 were found in few samples, while IL-4 and IL-10 were not detected in any sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of cytokines correlated with each other suggesting a response to the same stimulus, however, there was no association with either disease activity or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cytokines related to activity of the innate immune response were most prominent in this study and showed good correlation with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In particular, it was shown that IL-15 was raised in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no pattern of cytokine expression relating to disease activity or treatment </plain></SENT>
