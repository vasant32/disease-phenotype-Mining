<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (ivTA) injection in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular edema</z:hpo> (CME) due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten eyes of seven patients with CME associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A quantity of 4 mg of triamcinolone acetonide was injected intravitreally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maculas of the patients were evaluated with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography (FA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The change in visual acuity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> leakage, macular thickness, and potential complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 15.6 months (range 7-19 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increase of more than two Snellen lines in the visual acuity in seven of the ten eyes (70%) at the last examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> regressed completely in eight of the ten eyes (80%) at the last visit on OCT and FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean central macular thickness assessed by OCT was 406 mum before treatment and 186.9 mum at the last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intraocular pressure (IOP) exceeded 21 mmHg in six eyes of five patients (60%) during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the last visit, the IOP was less than 21 mmHg in five eyes with medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>One eye</z:mp> underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> filtration surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four eyes of three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In four eyes of four patients (40%), a second ivTA injection was given due to relapsing CME </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (ivTA) may be beneficial in the management of CME in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Repeated ivTA injections might be required if CME reoccurs </plain></SENT>
