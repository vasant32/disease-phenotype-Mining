<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is common in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), we looked for an association between <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in BD and the presence of factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-three patients with BD according to International Study Group criteria and 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> by American College of Rheumatology criteria as controls participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD and controls were tested for the presence of factor V Leiden by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA and by restriction enzymatic analysis of PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three of 23 patients with BD were positive for factor V Leiden (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among BD patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 0/15 were positive; among those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 3 of 8 were positive (37.5%) for factor V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient with RA was positive for factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of factor V Leiden in patients with BD may markedly increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
