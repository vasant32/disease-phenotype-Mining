<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case series of 14 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were born in the Comoros, reporting to the single primary general medicine department of Mayotte's island since 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients but one satisfied the international group study criteria for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report a series of 14 patients (13 unrelated) including 10 men and features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two multicase family histories were elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean diagnosis delay was 5.5 ± 5.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease presented mainly as neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet in five patients including three with progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1328447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in three patients, relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> in two patients, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic disease</z:e> with mucocutaneous disease in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were tested and were found to be HLA-B51 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and most of them received additional immunosuppressive treatment, mainly <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be an under-reported, HLA-B51 negative, condition in native East African populations and appears to be often life-threatening and/or associated with severe damage in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A high degree of awareness of physicians is necessary to shorten diagnostic delays and to improve the management of patients </plain></SENT>
