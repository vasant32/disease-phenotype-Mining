<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the relationship of the eNOS Glu298 --&gt; Asp polymorphism with the presence and severity of BD in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two patients with BD and 100 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses of Glu298Asp polymorphism in exon 7 of the eNOS gene were made by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of the eNOS genotypes were similar for BD patients (GG:GT:TT = 58.7%:38%:3.3%) and controls (59.2%:33.7%:7.1 %), P = 0.335 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No evidence of difference was found in the frequency of the T allele between BD patients (22.3%) and controls (24%), [OR = 0.91, 95% CI (0.55-1.50), P = 0.690] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glu298 --&gt; Asp polymorphism of the eNOS gene does not appear to be associated with the presence of BD in the Turkish population </plain></SENT>
