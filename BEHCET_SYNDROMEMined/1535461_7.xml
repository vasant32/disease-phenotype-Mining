<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here an unusual case of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, characterized by the importance of the thrombotic events (7 <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> of both legs and resection of two toes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional manifestations of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome occurred only 10 years after the first thrombotic episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The oldest daughter of the propositus and his brother suffered also from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>; this familial history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> led to the performance of a haemostatic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> was found in the propositus and in three of his children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> protein S levels were found in nine unrelated patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus this observation suggests that, when thrombotic manifestations are the first and major symptom of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome, an additional cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has to be investigated </plain></SENT>
