<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is closely related to endothelial cells, leucocyte functions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate circulating selectin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, which are known to play a significant part in the immune response especially by regulating interactions of the leucocytes with endothelium, in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma E-, L-, and P-selectin concentrations were evaluated in 11 patients with widespread BD (group I), 10 cases with merely mucocutaneous involvement (group II) and 15 age and sex matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were newly or previously diagnosed cases not taking any drug for BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> selectins were significantly higher in group I compared with group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E-selectin and P-selectin were significantly increased in each subgroup of patients compared with the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>L-selectin concentrations were higher than the controls only in group I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increases in the selectins in BD may be a direct consequence of the leucocyte, endothelium and platelet activations observed during the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, abnormal/increased selectin expression to various triggers should also be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More prominent increases in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0849867" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">extensive disease</z:e> suggest that circulating selectin concentrations are related to disease severity </plain></SENT>
