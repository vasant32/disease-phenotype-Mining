<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the feasibility of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in the evaluation of intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients diagnosed to have intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease prospectively underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients had previously undergone abdominal surgery for intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease 27-81 months previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Breath-hold T2-weighted single-shot fast spin echo, T1-weighted multiplanar spoiled gradient recalled echo, and postgadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted opposed-phase multiplanar spoiled gradient recalled echo images were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings were analyzed by three independent radiologists in terms of the presence and location of bowel wall thickening and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>, maximal bowel wall thickness, grade of bowel wall enhancement, and presence and nature of extraluminal manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>K statistics were used to evaluate interobserver variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven cases (88%), including the five cases with previous operations, demonstrated bowel thickening of more than 9 mm and increased enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>Ulcer</z:mpath> was depicted in four cases (50%) in the terminal ileum or an anastomosis site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three cases (38%) showed extraluminal manifestation, such as mesenteric infiltration around the involved bowel (two cases) and a sinus tract to subhepatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Breath-hold <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is useful for the evaluation of bowel wall thickening, enhancement, mesentery infiltration, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Characteristic ulcerative lesions may be also depicted on T1- and T2-weighted breath-hold images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is a useful method for postoperative follow-up study for the evaluation of recurrence </plain></SENT>
