<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the Japanese, HLA-B8 positives have been assumed to be extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using some HLA-B8 typing sera, a new HLA-B antigen, HLA-Bw4 positive, was found in the Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This new HLA-B antigen, tentatively named HOK-1, showed a phenotype frequency of 3.7% and a gene frequency of 1.9 +/- 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strong linkage disequilibrium was noted between HOK-1 and HLA-Cw1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HOK-1 antigenic specificity was assigned as HLA-Bw 59 by the WHO nomenclature committee after the 8th International Histocompatibility Workshop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations of this antigen with following diseases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> vulgaris, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, so far as, in the Japanese, compared with that the HLA-B8 antigen has a characteristic association with organ specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> in Caucasian </plain></SENT>
