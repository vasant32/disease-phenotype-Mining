<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the involvement of gammadelta T-cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gammadelta T-cells in the peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Israeli patients with definite BD (n = 23), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 16), and patients with familial Mediterrranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>; n = 20) were evaluated by means of flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The responses of patient and control gammadelta T-cells to medium conditioned by microorganisms cultured from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> of a patient with active BD were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportions of CD3(+) and CD8(+) cells in the PBMCs were not significantly different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, gammadelta-T-cells accounted for 7.01% +/- 4.42% of the PBMCs in BD compared with 3.56% +/- 3.45% in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> (P &lt; .005) and 3.7% +/- 3.15% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (P &lt; .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their numbers were significantly higher during active disease than in remission (9.45% +/- 5.08% versus 2.27% +/- 3.3%; P &lt; .009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of T-cell-receptor gammadelta(+) and Vdelta2(+) cells of BD patients, but not of controls, increased after 96 hours of culture in medium containing supernatant of microorganisms cultured from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> in a patient with BD relative to their proportions in control medium: 58.2% vs 13.9% (P &lt; .05) and 28% vs 9% (P &lt; .04), respectively, of the cultured T-cells (n = 4).gammadelta T-cells are expanded in BD PBMCs during active disease </plain></SENT>
