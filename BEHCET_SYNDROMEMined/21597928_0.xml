<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate ANS function by using electrophysiological tests in patients with BD and to determine the relationship between the disease activity parameters and the indicators of autonomic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We included 70 BD patients and 50 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic characteristics including age, sex, and disease duration were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A detailed neurological examination was performed, and clinical autonomic symptoms were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) was used to determine the disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined for laboratory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological assessments of ANS function were performed by sympathetic skin response (SSR) and R-R interval variation (RRIV) tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean values of sympathetic (SSR latency and amplitude) and parasympathetic (RRIV at rest [R%] and deep breathing [D%], D% - R%, and D%/R%) parameters were compared, and any correlations between ANS parameters and clinical disease characteristics were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy BD patients (23 males, 47 females) with a mean age of 41.2 ± 10.01 years and 50 control subjects (18 males, 32 females) with a mean age of 39.5��± 8.94 years were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects were totally symptom free with respect to ANS involvement, and the subjects in both groups had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological examination findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The demographic characteristics were similar between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean latency of SSR was increased (1.4 ±���0.4 vs 0.7 ± 0.8), and R% (0.3 ± 0.3 vs 0.5 ± 0.4) and D% (0.3 ± 0.3 vs 0.6 ± 0.5) values were decreased in BD patients compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between BDCAF scores and ANS variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant correlation between SSR latency and ESR and CRP values (p &lt; 0.01, r = -0.25, r = -0.31, respectively) in the patient group, indicating a more sympathetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>dysautonomia</z:hpo> in patients with active laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study indicates a subclinical sympathetic and parasympathetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> in patients with BD, which may be related with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As the early recognition of abnormalities in ANS may be very important in order to prevent excessive morbidity, simple electrophysiological methods are suggested to identify <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients at high risk for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>dysautonomia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
