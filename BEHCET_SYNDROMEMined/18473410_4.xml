<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To research the etiology, portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and other features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (BCS) patients prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 75 patients (40 female, 35 male) who were diagnosed between January 2002 and July 2004 as having BCS were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings from on physical examination, ultrasonography, duplex ultrasonography and venography were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemogram and blood chemistry were studied at the time of diagnosis and on each hospital visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination and immune phenotyping were performed by a hematologist when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Protein C, S, antithrombin III, activated protein C resistance, and anticardiolipin antibodies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo>, and anti ds-DNA were studied twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of ascite, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002040'>esophageal varices</z:hpo>, and portal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were evaluated at admission and on every visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least one etiological factor was determined in 54 (72%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The etiology could not be defined in 21 (28%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One etiological factor was found in 39, 2 factors in 14 and 3 factors in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common cause was the web (16%), the second was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013502" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hydatid disease</z:e> (11%), the third was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was present in 11 patients and at least one etiology was identified in 9 of them (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013502" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hydatid disease</z:e> are more prominent etiological factors in Turkey than in other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with web have an excellent response to treatment without signs of portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> while patients having thrombofilic factors more than one are prone to develop portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with worse clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
