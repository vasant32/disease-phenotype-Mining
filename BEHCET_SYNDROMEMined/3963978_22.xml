<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide, an oral pharmaceutical available on strict protocol, has therapeutic effects based on proposed modulation of CIC- and neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thalidomide therapy was started for four patients with significant morbidity from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and for one patient with bowel-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatosis</z:e>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
