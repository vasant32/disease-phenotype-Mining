<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to E. faecalis, compared with 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to S. pyogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls, using S. pyogenes, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and E. faecalis as antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
