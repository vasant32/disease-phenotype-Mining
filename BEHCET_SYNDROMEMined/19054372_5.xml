<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, both of which are codependent and contribute to the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we sought to investigate whether the selected VEGF polymorphisms [-634 C/G, +936 C/T and an 18 bp insertion/deletion (I/D) at -2549 of the VEGF promoter region] are associated with susceptibility and severity of BD in the Tunisian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-five Tunisian BD patients and 157 healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VEGF gene was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by digestion with restriction endonucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VEGF serum levels of BD patients and healthy controls were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no association between the VEGF polymorphisms and the susceptibility to BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, when data were analysed according to the presence of each symptom, we found a positive association between VEGF 18 bp I/D polymorphism and ocular involvement as well as BD severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, among the BD patients, the frequency of the 18 bp I/I genotype was less in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> (6.1% vs 24.6%, P = 0.007) and in patients with severe BD (9.2% vs 21.4%, P = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mean serum VEGF level was considerably higher in BD patients (P &lt; 0.01) than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that VEGF gene polymorphisms may be involved in the development of the ocular BD as well as the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
