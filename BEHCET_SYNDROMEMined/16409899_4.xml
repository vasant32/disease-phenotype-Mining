<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple therapeutic modalities have been used to treat <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These agents act through different mechanisms and are associated with a variety of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a case-comparative study to evaluate efficacy of combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> in the treatment and prophylaxis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients who fulfilled the international study group criteria for diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups: group 1 (20 patients) received 1.2 Mu <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> injection monthly; group 2 (21 patients) received two tablets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> daily (each tablet contained 0.5 mg); and group 3 (25 patients) received both 1.2 Mu <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> injection monthly and two tablets of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient was followed up monthly for 5 months, 4 months on treatment and 1 additional month followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestation index (CMI), the numerical sum of the clinical features, was calculated for each patient initially and then monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pathergy</z:e> test was performed for each patient monthly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The CMI was reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> treatment, and the reduction was highly significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the CMI remains satisfactory and good for 1 month after stopping the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When each <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">Penicillin</z:chebi> are used alone the index is also reduced significantly, but this reduction is much less than when both drugs are used together and there is also rapid and earlier relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51344">benzathine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> appears to be of greater efficacy in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease than the use of either drug alone </plain></SENT>
