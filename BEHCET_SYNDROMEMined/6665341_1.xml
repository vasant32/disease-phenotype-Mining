<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had severe forms, essentially ocular, which had been previously treated by steroids and/or immunosuppressors for a number of years without effect on the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PE was associated with classical medical therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had daily PE on three consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poor results were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had monthly PE and a clinical improvement was observed in 4 cases, usually with a reduction in the number of exacerbations </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cases, PE should be repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a longer follow-up is necessary to confirm these results </plain></SENT>
