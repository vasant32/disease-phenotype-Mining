<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination is regarded as safe and effective for the general population, recommendations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B immunization in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to elucidate the response of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination and to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination has any adverse effects on the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> and 15 healthy individuals were enrolled into a prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received the 3-dose series of routine <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface response was evaluated 1-3 months after the third dose of vaccine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The responder rates for patient and control groups were 12/13 (92.8%) and 14/15 (93.8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of both the responder rates and mean antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings might suggest that the majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> develop protective antibody response after <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B vaccination and that the immune response against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen is adequate, efficient and intact </plain></SENT>
