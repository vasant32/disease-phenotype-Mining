<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients undergoing simple aortic valve replacement (AVR) required a second or third operation as a result of prosthetic valve dehiscence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyze our experience with surgical management for AR in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease during an 11-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 1997 through December 2008, 10 male patients (mean age, 38.4 ± 6.9 years) with AR caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease underwent surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary procedures were AVR in seven cases and aortic root replacement in three (two Bentall, one Cabrol) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of follow-up was 5.3 ± 3.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the seven patients with simple AVR, valve dehiscence occurred in six after an interval of 2.9 ± 1.7 months, necessitating 11 reoperations (four redo AVRs, one redo redo-AVR, four aortic root replacements, and two heart transplants) with one early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In aortic root replacement patients, two Bentall patients survived and required no reintervention, and the Cabrol patient died from electromechanical uncoupling one year postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the seven survivors, the definite procedure was aortic root replacement in four cases, heart transplantation in two, and AVR in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rate of valve dehiscence was high after isolated AVR in patients with AR caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the first operation, aortic root replacement should be the procedure of choice, preferably with a homograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Heart transplantation might be a feasible alternative to aortic root replacement in selected patients </plain></SENT>
