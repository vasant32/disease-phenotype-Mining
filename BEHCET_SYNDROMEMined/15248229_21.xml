<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 20 patients with active BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this group, a set of chemokines as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines in biopsy specimens obtained from oral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406191" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudofolliculitis</z:e> lesions, and lesions at the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> testing were studied using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed important increases in the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) ( approximately 700-fold), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( approximately 65-fold), interferon-gamma ( approximately 71-fold), and IL-12 ( approximately 69-fold) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> in BD lesions compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for IL-10 ( approximately 75-fold increase), Th2 cytokines (i.e., IL-4 and IL-13) were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a direct role of Th1 lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of mucocutaneous BD lesions </plain></SENT>
