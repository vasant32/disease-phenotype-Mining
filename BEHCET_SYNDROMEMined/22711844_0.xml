<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several genetic factors such as the TNF-α gene have been evaluated as contributors to the pathogenesis of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the association between six TNF-α SNPs and susceptibility to BD, or the major clinical manifestations, in Moroccan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The six SNPs studied were: c.-1211C&gt;T (rs1799964), c.-1043C&gt;A (rs1800630), c.-1037C&gt;T (rs1799724), c.-556G&gt;A (rs1800750), c.-488G&gt;A (rs1800629) and c.-418G&gt;A (rs361525), known as -1031T&gt;C, -863C&gt;A, -857C&gt;T, -376G&gt;A, 308G&gt;A and -238G&gt;A, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SNPs were genotyped by direct sequencing in 120 unrelated Moroccan BD and 112 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele and genotype distributions were compared between groups using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the -1211C allele was higher in (i) BD patients than in controls [P = 0.02, odds ratio (OR) = 1.68, 95% CI 1.10, 2.56] and in (ii) patients with GUs than in those without (P = 0.002, OR = 3.84, 95% CI 1.55, 9.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The -418A frequency was lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> (P = 0.0003, OR = 0.19, 95% CI 0.07, 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report the first association between BD and TNF-α SNPs in Moroccan patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We mainly observed that -1211C constitutes a susceptibility allele for both BD and GU, as previously reported for other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The -418A allele could be considered as a good prognostic factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo>, in Moroccan BD patients </plain></SENT>
