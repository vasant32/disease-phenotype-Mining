<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The "hygiene hypothesis" suggests that a reduction in the exposure to infectious agents due to improved health conditions has contributed to the increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the hygiene hypothesis, many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> such as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) are more frequently observed in developed countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the relevance of hygiene hypothesis in neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (NBD), another <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, we developed and administered a multiple choice questionnaire to evaluate the hygiene conditions and practices of age and gender-matched NBD patients (n = 50) and control MS (n =5 0) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (n = 50) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, MS patients had the highest socio-economic and hygiene features, whereas NBD patients displayed a lower socio-economic status group and showed poorer hygiene conditions than MS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These poor hygiene conditions might be increasing the susceptibility of exposure to infectious agents that might, at least in part, trigger the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> involved in NBD pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
