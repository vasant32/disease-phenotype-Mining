<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to investigate synovial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_188'>immunopathology</z:mpath> differences between early <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et disease (BD) and psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (PsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Needle arthroscopy of an inflamed knee joint was performed in patients with early untreated BD (n = 8) and PsA (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Synovial fluid (SF) was collected for cytokines, perforin, and granzyme analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight synovial biopsies per patient were obtained for immunohistochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate (T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, B cells, plasma cells, mast cells, and neutrophils), blood vessels as well as expression of perforin and granzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stained slides were evaluated by digital image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The global degree of synovial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> was similar in the two types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of the innate immune cell infiltration, there was a striking neutrophilic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in BD <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> whereas PsA displayed significantly higher numbers of cells positive for c-kit, a marker of mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As for lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, but neither CD20+ B cells nor CD138+ plasma cells, were significantly increased in BD versus PsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the T-lymphocyte population showed no clear shift in CD4/CD8 ratio or Th1/Th2/Th17 profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SF levels of perforin, an effector molecule of cytotoxic cells, displayed a significant four- to fivefold increase in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This systematic comparative analysis of early untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100769'>synovitis</z:hpo> identifies neutrophils and T lymphocytes as important infiltrating cell populations in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of perforin in BD suggest the relevance of cytotoxicity in this disease </plain></SENT>
