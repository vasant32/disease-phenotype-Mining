<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate whether neurological impairment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing brain can be assessed by means of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The averaged apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values were calculated in 22 different radiologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing brain regions in 32 patients with and without neurological findings and 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in bilateral frontal, temporal and occipital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing white matter were significantly higher in the patient groups compared with the control subjects (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these brain regions, DWI revealed differences in the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values between patients with neurological findings (including symptomatic and neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet patients) and the asymptomatic patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values of patients without symptoms to those of the control group allowed clear discrimination between patients with and without neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI may serve to assess subclinical neurological involvement in BD, even when structural changes are absent </plain></SENT>
