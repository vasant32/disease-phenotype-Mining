<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT), prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), associated with impairement of fibrinolysis were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total fibrinolytic activity, measured on fibrin plates, plasma concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA:Ag) and plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complexes (<z:mp ids='MP_0010998'>PAP</z:mp>) were low, whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 concentration (PAI-1:Ag) was elevated in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There intravenous 500 mg doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, given on day 0, 7 and 50, resulted in a marked clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by the normalization of augmented thrombin generation and increased fibrinolytic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to show prothrombotic tendency in a relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> and beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy on haemostatic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A degree of activation of coagulative and fibrinolytic system seems to be of importance in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e>, and monitoring of hemostatic parameters could be helpful in clinical assessment </plain></SENT>
