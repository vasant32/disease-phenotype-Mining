<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 12 Turkish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> patients who had been treated with IFN-α-2a between February 2009 and October 2011 because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> refractory to traditional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFN-α-2a was initially administered at 4.5×10(6) IU/day subcutaneously; then, the dosage was tapered gradually depending on the clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous immunosuppressive drugs such as systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were stopped 1 day before the initiation of IFN-α-2a treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean duration of IFN-α-2a use was 13.3 months (range: 3-28 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of patients with ocular BD achieved partial or complete response </plain></SENT>
