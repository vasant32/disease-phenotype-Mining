<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is often resistant to empirical treatments such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">5-aminosalicylic acid</z:chebi>, immunomodulators and steroids and often causes a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, requiring surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, intestinal lesions are considered to be a poor prognostic factor in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, against intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, however, it remains unknown whether anti-TNFα therapy can improve the prognosis of patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We herein report the case of an adult female patient with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who responded well to the induction therapy with infliximab, and has been maintained in remission by scheduled administration of infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her C-reactive protein level has been sustained at a negative level, and endoscopic findings revealed complete mucosal healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, infliximab may have the potential to induce "sustained deep remission" in patients with intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
