<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A descriptive questionnaire survey was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 25 eye centres in 14 countries returned questionnaires on prevalent cases in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were analysed on 1,465 patients with ocular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent oral aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> were reported in 94.5%, <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in 69.5% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo> in 61.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients had bilateral and recurrent intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>Poor visual acuity</z:hpo> was seen in 18.9% in women, but 24.8% in men (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>Panuveitis</z:hpo> was seen more in men than in women (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>23% of the patients had visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/200 at the final visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>poor vision</z:hpo> were more frequently in India, Iran and Japan than in other countries (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report the largest contemporary international case series of patients with ocular involvement in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>Panuveitis</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in men than women, and men tended to have a worse visual prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were some differences in the clinical pattern of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in different countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite modern treatment, the disease still carries a poor visual prognosis with one-quarter of the patients blind </plain></SENT>
