<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of two tertiary Spanish centres (Hospital Clínico San Cecilio, Granada and Hospital Clínic, Barcelona) with the use of adalimumab for the treatment of severe clinical manifestations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) in whom immunosuppressive therapy had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review from patients with BD treated with adalimumab in two specialized Spanish centres (Hospital Clínico San Cecilio, Granada and Hospital Clínic, Barcelona) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From November 2006 to February 2011, 19 patients with BD were treated with adalimumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reason to initiate adalimumab was refractory disease in 17 (89.5%) patients and adverse events to CSA and infliximab in two (10.5%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main clinical manifestations leading to adalimumab administration were <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> in eight patients, severe bipolar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> in eight, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in three and severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, adalimumab achieved clinical improvement in 17 of the 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, ocular manifestations (<z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>) responded rapidly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to clinical improvement, treatment with adalimumab was associated with reduction in the number and dose of standard <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of interest, seven patients had received TNF-α inhibitors before adalimumab, five infliximab and the remaining two etanercept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adalimumab was withdrawn in only one patient due to severe infusional reaction in the form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001025'>urticaria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100665'>angioedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adalimumab is a valid option for patients with BD and recalcitrant non-controlling manifestations with good safety profile </plain></SENT>
