<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-B51 was present in 71 percent of the patient group as compared with 13 percent of the control group (relative risk = 17.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four of 30 families in the B51-positive group, there was a close relative of the proband with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome who was carrying the HLA-B51 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophilic chemotaxis in this group was enhanced in 80 percent of the patients, and in most patients no deposition of immunoglobulin in the dermo-epidermal junction was observed, whereas C3 was present in papillary vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the B51-negative group, the family history was negative for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, neutrophilic chemotaxis was enhanced in only two of eight patients, and in four of six patients, IgM deposition was detected in the dermo-epidermal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in Israeli non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs, there is a significant association between HLA-B51 and the risk of developing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The B51-positive patient group has a family history of the disease, enhanced neutrophilic chemotaxis, and a lack of immunoglobulin deposition in the dermo-epidermal junction </plain></SENT>
