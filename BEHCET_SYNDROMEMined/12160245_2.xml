<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 32 patients with BD and 30 healthy volunteers, HSV-1 specific DNA was not detected in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a highly sensitive competitive RT-PCR method, HSV-1 specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was not detected either in peripheral blood leukocytes from any of the patients or volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, serum levels of IgG anti HSV-1 antibody were higher in patients with BD; however, there were 70% sero-positives among the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even though it has been reported that the highly frequent presence of the HSV-1 genome in peripheral blood is a characteristic feature of BD, our results show that the HSV-1 genome and its expression are not present in peripheral blood in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could not find any evidence that the lesions associated with BD were caused by the direct lytic effects of HSV-1 </plain></SENT>
