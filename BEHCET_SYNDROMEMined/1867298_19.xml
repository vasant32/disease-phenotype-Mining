<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 400 patients, 183 (45.75%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo>, 98 (24.5%) ahd <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, 61 (15.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo>, and 58 (14.5%) had isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0012123'>posterior uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only four of the 98 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> (4.1%) were considered idiopathic after a comprehensive examination, whereas 94 of the 183 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012122'>anterior uveitis</z:hpo> (51.4%) were similarly classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found an associated condition in 242 of the 400 patients of the study group (60.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 242 patients, 61 had <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, which constituted the most frequently encountered associated condition in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 61 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 58 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> and constituted 59.2% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An associated condition was found in 95% and 96.2% of patients with unilateral and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012121'>panuveitis</z:hpo>, respectively, but in none of the patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012124'>intermediate uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
