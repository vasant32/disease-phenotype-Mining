<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, recurrent, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e>, and serious ocular involvement may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some BD patients, latent tissue damage caused by recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> is not reflected by visual acuity or ophthalmoscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the morphological and functional changes of ocular features related to duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in BD patients, and analysed their association with visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight eyes of 20 patients with ocular BD were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eyes with marked complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011505'>cystoid macular oedema</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000608'>macular degeneration</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During clinical remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo>, perimetric sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness were measured by Micro Perimeter 1 (MP-1) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between MP-1 and OCT findings, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) and duration from initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> were analysed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: logMAR correlated with perimetric sensitivity measured with MP-1 at the fovea, inner macula and outer macula, but not with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness based on OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> correlated significantly with logMAR and with OCT-based <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness at the fovea, inner macular and outer macula, but not with MP-1-derived <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> perimetric sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between OCT-based <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness and the corresponding MP-1-derived <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> sensitivity at the fovea, inner macula or outer macula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that visual acuity, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> perimetric sensitivity and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thickness decrease with an increase in the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> in BD patients, but that <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> perimetric sensitivity is relatively preserved among these factors </plain></SENT>
