<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested 23 patients with BD and 139 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls for autoantibodies to nuclear, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and smooth muscle antigens using indirect immunofluorescence, immunodiffusion, Western blots and an enzyme immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum immunoglobulin G, M and A levels were measured by standard radial immunodiffusion techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the following autoantibodies was raised in patients with BD compared with the control group: ANA on rodent (P &lt; 0.05) and human (P &lt; 0.01) substrates and smooth muscle antibody (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibody was detected in one patient (GPL 23.1 U) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to the ribonucleoproteins Ro, La, Sm and RNP were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of serum immunoglobulins G, M and A were elevated in BD compared with the controls and this was significant for immunoglobulin M (P &lt; 0.05) and A (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings support the concept of a polyclonal B cell activation in BD </plain></SENT>
