<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease in many patients does not fully meet the diagnostic criteria defined by the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease, and instead such patients are diagnosed as having an incomplete type of BD according to the criteria of the BD Research Committee of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient reported here developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> of the extremities as the initial symptoms and was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 16 years, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> relapsed and multiple deep <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> suddenly developed in the gastrointestinal tract, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcer</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intestinal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, progressive, severe, and extensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a diagnosis of incomplete BD with intestinal involvement, she was treated with high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, uncontrollable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> led to her <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination revealed that she suffered from intestinal and vascular BD, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> of the extremities has rarely been reported as a manifestation of vascular BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the disease course of this patient was characterized by the reappearance of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> after a long interval that preceded the devastating intestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
