<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normative values of RRIV and SSR were determined in a group of 25 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>R-R interval variation at rest (R%) and during deep breathing (D%), the difference between D% and R% (D-R), and the ratio of D% to R% (D/R) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>R-R interval variations did not show a significant difference between patients and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation with age for R%, D%, and D-R in the control group, but none was found in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SSR latencies were two standard deviations above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean values in three patients who described symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, symptoms of autonomic disturbance must be evaluated carefully for a possible involvement of ANS that might occur in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
