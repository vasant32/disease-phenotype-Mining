<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A sensitive radio-assay for ferritin was developed and used to examine serum ferritin levels in 105 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0554021" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent oral ulceration</z:e> (ROU), 41 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's syndrome (BS), 42 with other ulcerative oral lesions, 35 patients with non-ulcerative oral lesions and in 78 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ferritin levels increased with age and were significantly higher in males than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean ferritin concentrations in male patients with ROU, BS or with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> were significantly reduced in comparison with controls, and in female patients were significantly reduced in those with major aphthous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of low serum ferritin levels was about 8% in patients with ROU, 15% in BS and 9.5% in patients with other ulcerative oral lesions, compared with less than 3% in patients with non-ulcerative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral disorders</z:e> and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the iron-deficient patients were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin levels did not directly correlate with serum iron levels and may be a more accurate indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, serum ferritin can distinguish between patients with true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> and those with secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sideropenia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that in a small number of patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149745" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral ulceration</z:e> may be a presenting sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>, and that in a further small proportion of patients, ROU already present will be exacerbated by concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups will show a therapeutic response to correction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that serum ferritin levels are a useful part of the haematological investigations in patients with ROU </plain></SENT>
