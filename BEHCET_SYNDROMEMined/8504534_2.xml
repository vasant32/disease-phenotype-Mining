<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Total reflection x-ray fluorescence was used for quantitative analysis; in general, atomic absorption spectrometry was used only for control of the Se values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Zn, Se, and Rb concentrations were significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) lower for patients than for control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was determined in the Fe content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a significant increase in Cu in the patients so that the ratios Cu/Zn, Cu/Se, and Cu/Rb were significantly higher for the patients than for the control subjects (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
