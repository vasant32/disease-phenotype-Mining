<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase (COX), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was determined in neutrophils isolated from BD patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional assay of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase was significantly increased in BD patients, both at basal conditions and in response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in plasma MPO activity in the disease group as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total COX activity was significantly increased in BD neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in total COX activity was accompanied with enhanced activity of COX-2, differentiated by using the COX-1 isoform-specific inhibitor SC-560 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels showed no significant difference in BD; however, plasma nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> contents in BD patients were significantly greater compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, increased plasma MPO, neutrophil <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> and COX activities may contribute to intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> documented in BD patients </plain></SENT>
