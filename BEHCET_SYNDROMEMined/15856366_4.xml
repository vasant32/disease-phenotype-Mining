<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gastroduodenal mucosa appears to be the least frequently involved segment of the gastrointestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to assess the severity of gastric/duodenal involvement in BD patients in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria issued by the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We obtained and recorded clinical and laboratory data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A routine endoscopic examination with a urease test for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005202'>Helicobacter pylori infection</z:hpo> was arranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HLA tissue typing was also performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers to evaluate the possible genetic loads associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total 28 BD patients, diagnosed at DaLin TzuChi hospital from 1999 to 2002, were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence rate of gastric/duodenal ulceration was 43% (six patients had combined gastric and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo>, three patients had simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002592'>gastric ulcers</z:hpo>, and three patients had simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No risk factors of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi>) or H. pylori <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were found to be associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003300'>gastrointestinal ulcers</z:mp> in our BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004398'>peptic ulcers</z:hpo> responded well to systemic steroids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> treatment in this preliminary observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 7 of 12 gastric/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcer</z:hpo> patients (58%) carried an A2/B46/Cw1 or A11/B46/Cw1 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that gastric/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002588'>duodenal ulcers</z:hpo> were a common manifestation in Chinese patients with BD in Taiwan in close association with the distinct genotypes of A2/B46/Cw1 or A11/B46/Cw1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A good response to systemic steroids, rather than conventional H2 blockers, might be due to downregulation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
