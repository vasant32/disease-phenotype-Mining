<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease during an attack showed cellular hypersensitivity to their aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and synovial fluid, but not to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue extracts of humans, such as oral mucous membrane, skin, retina and uvea, nor to their peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
