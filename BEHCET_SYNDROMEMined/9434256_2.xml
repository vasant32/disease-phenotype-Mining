<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide clinical support for the earlier data, erythrocyte membrane integrity was investigated by measuring malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, a marker of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation) levels in the erythrocytes of BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) at 25 and 250 microg/ml concentrations on lipoperoxidation induced by <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>) in erythrocyte obtained from BD patients was examined in in vitro conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared to healthy controls, basal erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were found to be higher in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the in vitro study, there was also a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>-induced <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> production in the medium containing no EGb 761 in the patient group, whereas significant decreases in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were observed in the mediums containing EGb 761 both in the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decrease in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> production was found to be related to EGb 761 concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that an oxidative damage is present in erythrocytes obtained from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients, and EGb 761, which may strengthen the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system, may contribute to the treatment of BD </plain></SENT>
