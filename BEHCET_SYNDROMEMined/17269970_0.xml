<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Caspase-9 is responsible for initiating the caspase activation cascade during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine caspase-9 expression in both endothelial and perivascular infiltrates of patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, attending the First Dermatology Department, Ankara Numune Hospital, Ankara, Turkey between June 2003 and December 2005, were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Oral biopsy specimens from nine healthy volunteers were taken as the healthy control group, and skin biopsies from 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> patients were used as the inflammatory control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specimens were examined with caspase-9 primary antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean caspase-9-positive endothelial cell counts were 7.17 +/- 2.45 in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 4.81 +/- 0.76 in healthy controls, and 4.35 +/- 1.34 in inflammatory controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and healthy controls was statistically significant, with increased endothelial staining in active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (P = 0.049) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and inflammatory controls was also statistically significant; the rate of staining was higher in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean caspase-9-positive dermal perivascular cell counts were 5.15 +/- 2.32 in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 3.32 +/- 0.82 in healthy controls, and 5.54 +/- 4.95 in inflammatory controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These values did not show any statistically significant difference (P = 0.407) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endothelial cells are one of the key cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, and our findings support the role of endothelial cells in the etiopathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
