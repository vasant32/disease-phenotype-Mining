<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of pre-operation diagnosis, surgical treatment methods and prospective efficacy of 26 patients who were diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome between January 2003 and April 2011 was analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 3 patients showed the clinical symptoms as <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion, 9 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, 13 patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> or phlebothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Totally 11 patients had experienced 22 cases surgical treatment including interventional therapy for 8 cases, open operation for 13 cases and hybrid operation for 1 case </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome patients combined with various vascular lesions should be thought of angio-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Choosing correct surgical treatment according to patient's condition and timing of pathological changes are the keys of gaining satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
