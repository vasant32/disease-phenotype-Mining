<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 41 patients (mean age 42.8 +/- 12.3 years) with BD and 35 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treadmill exercise test and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37804">thallium-201</z:chebi> myocardial perfusion single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a diagnosis of SMI in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting electrocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with BD (19.5%) had evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on exercise testing and myocardial perfusion SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one SMI positivity (2.9%) was recorded in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> was not found with coronary angiography in the patients with a diagnosis of SMI in Beçet's group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SMI positivity was recorded in 2 of 18 female patients (11%) and in 6 of 23 male patients (26.1%) with BD (p = 0.429) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of BD was 13.8 +/- 2.6 years in patients with SMI and 7 +/- 4.1 in patients without it (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 8 patients (87.5%) with SMI had a duration of BD of greater than 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the prevalence of SMI is high in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings, screening with myocardial perfusion scintigraphy may be recommended for patients with duration of BD greater than 10 years </plain></SENT>
