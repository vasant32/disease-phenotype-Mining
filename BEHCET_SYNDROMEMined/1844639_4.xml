<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the stigmata of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome could appear simultaneously or separately with intervals of several months to years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Besides, when a physician first meets patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intestinal ulcerations</z:e> of aphthoid or punched-out shape, if they do not have any stigma of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, the physician has some difficulty in making a diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the followings: 1) The upgrade in clinical type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with the advance of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="?"><plain>2) What portion of the patients with aphthoid or punched-out ulcerations, but without any other clinical feature of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, could be diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> with the advance of time </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the nonspecific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileocolitis</z:e> group, who had no major stigma of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome on their initial visit, 3 (30%) out of 10 patients were subsequently diagnosed as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> during the mean follow-up period of 33.3 months </plain></SENT>
