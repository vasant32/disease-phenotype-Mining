<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data and radiological findings on CT, MRI and cerebral angiography of 16 patients with NBD attending King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, from January 1990 to February 2003 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 16 patients with NBD, 11 patients (68.75%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> predominantly involving superior sagittal sinus causing intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, while 5 patients (31.25%) had symptoms and signs related to brain parenchymal involvement predominantly affecting brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pattern of distribution of brain parenchymal lesions in NBD might help to differentiate it from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> as well as from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating disease</z:e> such as multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a common manifestation of NBD </plain></SENT>
