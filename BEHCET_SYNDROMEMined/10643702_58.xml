<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG and IgM antinucleosome activities on nucleosome core particles from 496 patients with 13 different CTD and 100 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with CTD, 120 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), 37 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo> (systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>; SSc), 20 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026272" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MCTD">mixed connective tissue disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>), and 319 had other CTD, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sjögren's syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009071'>inflammatory myopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, Wegener's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032453" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsing polychondritis</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036202" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sarcoidosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antinucleosome-positive sera were further analyzed, by isotype-specific ELISA, for antinucleosome and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> (anti-dsDNA) IgG subclasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SLE, SSc, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e> were the only 3 CTD in which antinucleosome IgG were detected (71.7%, 45.9%, and 45.0% of patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antinucleosomes of the IgG3 subclass were present at high levels in patients with active SLE and were virtually absent in those with SSc, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCTD</z:e>, or inactive SLE, and their levels showed a positive correlation with SLE disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of note, an increase in levels of antinucleosome of the IgG3 isotype was observed during SLE flares, and this increase was found to be closely associated with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of antinucleosome of the IgG1 subclass showed a trend toward an inverse correlation with SLE disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant fluctuation in the anti-dsDNA isotype profile was observed in relation to SLE severity or clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IgG antinucleosome is a new marker that may help in the differential diagnosis of CTD; antinucleosome of the IgG3 isotype might constitute a selective biologic marker of active SLE, in particular, of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
