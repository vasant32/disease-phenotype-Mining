<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prolongation in seconds of PTT 1:1 mix after incubation in the confirmed presence or absence of LAC was correlated to strength of the LAC as well as length of incubation (1 vs. 2 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests that when screening for possible Factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors, a 2 hour incubation of a PTT 1:1 mix increases the frequency of false positives as compared to 1 hour incubation, and that most of these false positives are due to LACs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolongation of clotting times for PTT 1:1 mixes in patients with LAC is influenced by both length of incubation time and strength of the LAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: When using PTT 1:1 mixes to screen for FVIII inhibitors, the effect of a possible LAC on the interpretation of the PTT prolongation should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect is influenced by both incubation time and LAC strength </plain></SENT>
