<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1992 to 1998 data were collected on 100 pregnancies from 84 mothers who received tacrolimus systemically; 83 cases of solid organ transplantation, and 1 case of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maternal mean age at conception was 28 years and pregnancy outcome was live birth in 68%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> in 12%, induced abortion in 12%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>/perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 3%, ongoing pregnancy in 2%, and lost to follow up in 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine percent of the neonates were delivered prematurely (&lt; 37 weeks of gestation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Birth weight was appropriate for the gestational age in 90% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Malformations occurred in 4 neonates: case 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002435'>meningocele</z:hpo> and urogenital defects; case 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015923" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FAE|ARBD">alcoholic embryopathy</z:e>; case 3, ear defect, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003124'>hypospadia</z:mp>; case 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000003'>multicystic dysplastic kidney</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no consistent pattern of malformations and 2 mothers subsequently delivered a healthy neonate while on tacrolimus therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly 70% of pregnancies following systemic tacrolimus administration resulted in a favourable outcome without any significant effect on intrauterine growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of malformations was similar to that reported with other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> in transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
