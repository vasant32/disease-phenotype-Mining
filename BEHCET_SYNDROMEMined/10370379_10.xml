<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 patients with BD and 27 healthy controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro E-selectin endothelial cell expression was investigated by ELISA after HUVEC incubation with sera or purified IgG from patients with BD and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased E-selectin expression was observed when endothelial cells were incubated with sera from patients with active disease or from patients with circulating anti-endothelial cell antibodies and high levels of plasma myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of endothelial cell function have been suggested to play a role in the occurrence of vascular damage in BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that anti-endothelial cell antibodies and neutrophil <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, as inferred from the high plasma MPO levels in patients with active disease, may explain endothelial cell activation and neutrophil accumulation in vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
