<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old female who had <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease for 13 years complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, and was referred to our hospital for treatment in May 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bilateral meso-hypopharyngeal walls were swollen, and the epiglottis was edematously folded, occluding the larynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Epiglotectomy and thyrohyoidpexia were performed, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> disappearing after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two years after the operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> recurred because of two stepped cicatricial stenoses at the mesopharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An enlargement operation, incising the pharyngeal cicatricial tissue bilaterally and covering raw surfaces with free skins and the pedunculated cervical flap, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>, and tranilast (anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0869403,C0700625,C0020517" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">allergy</z:e> drug) were administered to prevent re-stenosis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases undergone surgical interventions have been reported, and this is the first case reporting long term result of the surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the skin and mucosa of patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease shows hyperreactivity to stimuli, the choice of surgical procedure is controversial and recurrence of stenosis is possible </plain></SENT>
