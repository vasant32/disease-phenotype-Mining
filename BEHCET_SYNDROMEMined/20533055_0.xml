<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intestinal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (BD) is challenging to diagnose, especially if the patient presents with typical colonoscopic findings of intestinal BD without systemic manifestations of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed this study to evaluate the systemic manifestations of BD in patients with typical colonoscopic findings of intestinal BD at the time of initial presentation and to identity the chronologic changes of these features during an extended follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-six consecutive patients who showed typical colonoscopic findings of intestinal BD at a single institution in Korea were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and endoscopic data were collected from a medical database and using a written questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters including demographic characteristics and the subset type of BD at the initial and endpoints of the follow-up were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 63.9 ± 50.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of cases that satisfied the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease criteria at initial diagnosis, 19.0%, increased to 53.2% by the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the Japanese criteria were used for classification, the proportion of complete and incomplete type BD increased (2.4% and 26.2% to 18.3% and 49.2%, respectively), while that of suspected and not-satisfied subtype BD decreased (22.2% and 49.2% to 19.0% and 13.5%, respectively) during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients who lack the systemic manifestations of BD could be included in the category of intestinal BD when typical intestinal lesion is identified, indicating that close examination and early treatment should be considered in such patients </plain></SENT>
