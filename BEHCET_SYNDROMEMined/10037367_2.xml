<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1991 through July 1996, 7 men and 1 woman 25 to 53 years old with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome were evaluated for lower urinary tract symptoms (7) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 8 patients 5 had neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation consisted of history, physical examination, urinalysis and urine culture, excretory urography, urodynamic studies, urethrocystoscopy, bladder biopsies and histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cystoscopy revealed bladder <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> in 1 patient and an indurated, hypervascular lesion in another with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000126'>hydronephrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common urodynamic finding was detrusor overactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 4 patients with poor compliance 1 had additional sphincteric deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common histopathological features were moderate and marked thickening of bladder vessel walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytic vascular reaction was present in 2 patients and lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clamshell augmentation ileocystoplasty was performed in 3 patients, including 1 who also underwent a sphincter enhancement procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining 5 patients received various nonsurgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Various types of voiding dysfunction relating to bladder and sphincteric components in both phases of micturition can be seen in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Voiding dysfunction can be due to either neurological or direct bladder involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Augmentation ileocystoplasty is a good treatment option for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome with severe bladder involvement </plain></SENT>
