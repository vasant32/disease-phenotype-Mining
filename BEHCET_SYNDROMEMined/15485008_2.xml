<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) has been proved to be useful in detecting neuro-<z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> in various diseases affecting the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we attempted to characterize the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in Korean patients with NBD and then examined the usefulness of 1HMRS in evaluating the MRI-negative brain area of NBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed brain MRI in 18 BD patients with neurologic symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven NBD patients without thalamic lesions and 8 healthy controls underwent brain 1H MRS, in which an 8 ml voxel was placed in the left thalamus and the N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>)/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> (Cr) ratio was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen of 18 BD patients were diagnosed as having NBD and 12 NBD patients (86%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and located in the midbrain, pons, basal ganglia, and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On 1H MRS, the thalamic area without gross abnormalities on MRI showed a significantly lower <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio in NBD patients compared to healthy controls (1.07 +/- 0.08 versus 1.54 +/- 0.27, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 NBD patients, the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratios, monitored serially, were normalized along with clinical improvement 6 months after treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and immune suppressive agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI is a very sensitive diagnostic method for NBD, and 1H MRS may be useful for the early detection and follow-up of MRI-negative NBD </plain></SENT>
