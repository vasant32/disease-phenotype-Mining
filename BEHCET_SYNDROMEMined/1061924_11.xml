<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reticuloid cells came in contact with small lymphocytes, to which the immunologic information was transferred, inducing them to undergo blast transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid cells, corresponding to T-cells, may produce a cytotoxic factor, since the prickle cells ultimately undergo degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes are consistent with those of delayed hypersensitivity reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasm of prickle cells apparently acts as an autoantigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome the macrophages were encountered in the epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other consequences were quite similar to those of RAU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nucleus of the macrophage is more electron dense and has condensed chromatin along with the nuclear membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This can be a difference between <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's syndrome and RAU only at the initial stage of the diseases </plain></SENT>
