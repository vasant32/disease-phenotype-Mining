<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bürger's disease was diagnosed initially based on the finding of bilateral radial artery obstruction, and the patient underwent vascular reconstructive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the operation, however, formation of false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was observed frequently in the left brachial artery at the elbow, which necessitated performance of vascular reconstructive surgery up to five times in total, including of the right common femoral artery, which had been punctured several times for investigational procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the clinical course, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, oral aphthoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003249'>genital ulcers</z:hpo>, and nodular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> appeared, and incomplete <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination suggested that the vascular lesion was consistent with necrotizing <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The systemic inflammatory findings and <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> improved following steroid administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vascular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is known as a special type of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, but usually develops in the patients with a long history of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our patient was believed to be very instructive because, when <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease occurs with <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> and the epidemiological characteristics agree with those of Bürger's disease like in our patient, differentiation may be difficult </plain></SENT>
