<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: Reports and abstracts published in 1986 through 1997 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> languages were identified by the MEDLINE database, the Reference Index Related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's Disease</z:e>, the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease conference proceedings, and abstract booklets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indexing terms used <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet and interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Twenty-two reports identified were included to estimate the efficacy of interferon alfa on mucocutaneous, ocular, and joint manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Responses of individual mucocutaneous signs were evaluated in 8 reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects were sufficiently documented in 12 reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met the criteria of the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet Syndrome Research Committee of Japan or those of the International Study Group for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and evaluated according to the following criteria: complete remission, disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> manifestations during treatment; partial remission, greater than 50% decrease in the number, severity, duration and/or frequency of recurrence of the lesions; stable disease, less than 50% change in the manifestations; and progressive disease, greater than 50% deterioration of existing manifestations or/and the development of new ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DATA SYNTHESIS: Systemic interferon alfa has been administered in 144 patients with Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease by subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of 3 to 18 x 10(6) units of interferon alfa-2a (70 patients) or 3 to 5 x 10(6) units of interferon alfa-2b (74 patients) daily or 3 times per week for 1 to 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent (92/124) of patients with mucocutaneous manifestations, 95% (37/39) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and 93% (51/55) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> exhibited a partial or complete response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interferon alfa-2a regimens were more effective than interferon alfa-2b ones on mucocutaneous (47% vs 7% complete response) and ocular (67% vs 8% complete response; P &lt; .001) manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mucocutaneous and ocular manifestations responded within 1 to 4 months after initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight percent (20/52) of patients with mucocutaneous lesions, 73% (8/11) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, and 88% (21/24) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> experienced recurrences immediately or up to 7 months after discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mild adverse effects were generally recorded; transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e>-like symptoms (87% vs 63%; P &lt; .05) and reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (24% vs 4%; P &lt; .05) occurred more often under interferon alfa-2a regimens, while reversible mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> was more common in patients receiving interferon alfa-2b (2% vs 28%; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Systemic interferon alfa treatment is reasonable for Adamantiades-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A 3-month high-dose regimen (9 x 10(6) units 3 times per week) followed by a low maintenance dose (3 x 10(6) units 3 times per week) is recommended </plain></SENT>
