<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased incidence of HLA-B51 in the patient group has also been reported in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, the B51 antigen has been identified to comprise 21 alleles, B*5101-B*5121 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, not only HLA-B*5101 but also HLA-B*5108 were found to be relatively increased in the patient groups among Italian and Saudi Arabian populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed HLA-B*51 allele genotyping by the polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method in order to investigate whether there is any correlation of one particular B51-associated allele with Japanese BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six Japanese patients with BD and 132 healthy Japanese volunteers were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, the phenotype frequency of the B51 antigen was confirmed to be remarkably increased in the patient group as compared to the ethnically matched control group (59.4% in patients vs. 13.6% in controls; Pc=0.0000000000098, R.R.=9.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the B*51 allele genotyping, 56 out of 57 B51-positive patients were defined as B*5101 and the remaining one was B*5102 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 18 B51-positive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were B*5101 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the Japanese patients and healthy controls carried the HLA-B*5108 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that B*51 allelic distribution in Japanese was different from those in Italian and Saudi Arabian populations, and that the significantly high incidence of the HLA-B51 antigen in the Japanese BD patient group was mostly caused by the significant increase of the HLA-B*5101 allele </plain></SENT>
