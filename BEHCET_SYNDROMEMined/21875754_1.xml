<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry studies showed antibodies to hippocampal and cerebellar molecular layers and the surface antigens of cultured hippocampal neurons in sera and/or cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of 13 of 20 NBD and 6 of 20 BD patients but not in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-titer STIP-1-antibodies were detected in 6 NBD patients' sera but not in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neuronal antibodies could be useful as diagnostic biomarkers in NBD </plain></SENT>
