<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients showed negative rheumatoid factor by latex fixation reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The determination of the interference on the phagocytosis of gamma globulin aggregated by guinea pig's macrophages was obtained by one formula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum characterization was determined by selecting the ones that presented the most expressive results in the phagocytosis interference, by facilitation or inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results, in absolute and percentage values, showed the predominance of the interference phenomenon in phagocytosis, with significant statistical values (p &lt; 0.05), when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis among the diseases studied in the quantification of the serum interference in the phagocytosis of the immunocomplexes has not showed any significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phagocytosis inhibition occurred with more preponderance in the serum of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035012" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Reiter's Syndrome</z:e> and Psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo>; in serum patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035012" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Reiter's Syndrome</z:e> there was a statistically significant difference in the inhibition of the phagocytosis (p = 0.0247) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The serum characterization did not show that the serum fraction was responsible for the phagocytosis interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this stage it has been verified that there has not been an uniformity in the graphic curve of dilutions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility of the existence of more than one element with interference in the phagocytosis of the studied immunocomplexes was mentioned </plain></SENT>
