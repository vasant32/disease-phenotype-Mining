<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endogenous nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), produced by endothelial cells, has pleiotropic effects such as vasodilatator, antiplatelet, antiproliferative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced at sites of endothelial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ROS target polyunsaturated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, which results in malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in BD patients by measuring <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> and total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status (TAS) levels and to establish a possible relationship with respect to NO levels regarding disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 55 BD patients (30 active/25 inactive) and 20 healthy volunteers were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn following an overnight fasting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TAS and <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels were determined spectrophotometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> (NO(2-)) and nitrate (NO(3-)) levels were measured to estimate NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Data were expressed as mean ± SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TAS levels were significantly lower in BD patients than the controls (1.19 ± 0.34 vs. 3.29 �� 0.89 mmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the active BD group, <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels (0.36 ± 0.19 nmol/mL) were significantly higher than both the inactive BD group (0.25 ± 0.18 nmol/mL) and controls (0.18 ± 0.41 nmol/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NO levels were significantly lower in the active group compared to the inactive group (18.0 ± 2.80 vs. 19.40 ± 2.70 µmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi> levels correlated negatively with NO levels in the active group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decreased NO levels mediated by increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> significantly contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endothelial dysfunction</z:e> observed in BD </plain></SENT>
