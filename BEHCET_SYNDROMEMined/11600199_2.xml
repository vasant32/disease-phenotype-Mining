<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, long-term T cell lines from peripheral blood of BD patients (n=6) and controls (n=7) were stimulated with mycobacterial recombinant <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> and purified protein derivate (<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>) and expanded with IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the BD group, 15 out 27 and in the controls, 25 out of 35 PPD specific T cell lines have responded to the synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> of the human HSP60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of the primarily <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-specific T cell lines, 17/23 in patients and 8/8 in controls did recognize a <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> of human origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell lines specifically reactive to 136-150, 179-197, 244-258 and 336-351 could be raised with similar frequency in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a previous report, T cells also reacted to <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 425-441 frequently in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that the human proliferative response to mycobacterial <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> may also target the self-protein in both BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the responsive T cells may have different effects depending on their functional features such as cytokine secretions </plain></SENT>
