<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this time, 27 (24.5%) patients with neuro-BD were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty out of 27 showed at least one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack in their clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 14 of them, a neurological evaluation was carried out during the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other 13 patients were evaluated during a remission phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neuro-BD was usually characterized by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack with motor symptoms (66.6%) and behavioural/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> (47.6%), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was more frequent in the remission phase (76.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On magnetic resonance imaging, large brain-stem/diencephalon lesions were usually seen during the attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remission phase, they were often located in the white-matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Aspecific cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were usually seen during the attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid analysis together with radiological and clinical features seems to be useful for the differential diagnosis in these patients </plain></SENT>
