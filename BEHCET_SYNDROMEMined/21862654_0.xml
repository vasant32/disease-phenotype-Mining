<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Recent studies have demonstrated that a new anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α antibody, infliximab, is effective in controlling ocular inflammatory attacks in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of infliximab on gene expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients was investigated before and after initiation of infliximab treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A human whole-genome microarray of 54,359 genes was used to analyze <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from four patients (three women, one man, 21-64 years at age) at baseline and at 22 weeks after initiation of infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed for selected up- or downregulated genes, to confirm the microarray results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-TNF-α therapy reduced the frequency of ocular episodes in three of four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among inflammatory cytokine-related genes, TNF blockade reduced expression of interleukin (IL)-1 receptor type 2, interferon-γ receptors, IL6, IL6 receptor, gp130, and IL17 receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, gene expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), receptor for mycobacterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33563">glycolipid</z:chebi> (C-type lectin domain family 4, member E: CLEC4E), and complexin 2 (CPLX2) was downregulated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several up- or downregulated genes identified in this study may be candidates for further investigation in identifying the molecular mechanism of infliximab in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease with refractory uveoretinitis </plain></SENT>
