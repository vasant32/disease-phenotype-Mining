<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, he presented right-upper quadrantanopia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> and lack of the light reflex in the left eye, left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, and bilateral pathologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> fluid attenuated inversion recovery images showed left side dominant, high intensity lesions on the brainstem and the diencephalon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HLA-B51 was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CSF IL-6 was extremely elevated (998 pg/ml: reference value &lt; = 6.0 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these, we concluded he had the neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and treated him by high dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This treatment improved his symptoms and MRI lesions, and decreased the CSF IL-6 levels initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On 13th day after the first his discharge, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> appeared and the CSF IL-6 levels elevated again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to the high dose intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> attack, 15 mg/week of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was started to prevent the recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even with this prevention, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> related to neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease occurred within six weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We administered 5 mg/kg of infliximab intravenously at 0, 2, 6, and 14 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After the infliximab treatment, his symptoms improved and the IL-6 levels decreased, and no recurrence has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This case supports that infliximab, anti-TNF-alpha agent, is a good candidate for neuro-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease treatment when it is resistant to conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
