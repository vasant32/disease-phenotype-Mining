<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have characterized immune responses in intestinal lesions of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of BD and healthy controls (HC) and tissue specimens of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (intestinal BD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC) were analysed for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBL of BD patients expressed the Th1-related chemokine receptor, CCR5 and CXCR3 preferentially compared with those of healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intestinal lesions of BD expressed interferon (IFN)-gamma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-12 mRNA, indicating Th1 skewed responses in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of Txk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase specific to Th1 cells, was expressed in the lesions, suggesting its contribution to the Th1-dominant responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the intestinal samples, CCR5 was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases with BD, whereas Th2-related CCR3 and CCR4 were detected randomly, mainly in the cases with inactive BD and those receiving large amounts of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, indicating the Th1-dominant immune responses in the intestinal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As the ligands of CCR5, MIP1alpha and MIP1beta were detected, whereas RANTES was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) 60 was expressed in PBL and intestinal tissues of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Th1-dominant immune responses and HSP60 expression may induce the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> and thus be associated with the pathogenesis of intestinal BD </plain></SENT>
