<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T, CT60 A/G polymorphisms and BD using; (1) allele contrast, (2) the recessive model, (3) the dominant model, and (4) the additive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 8 separate comparison studies on BD were considered in the meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis of the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphisms showed no association between BD and the CTLA-4 +49 G allele in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 0.780, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.491-1.240, p = 0.294) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, stratification by ethnicity indicated no association between the CTLA-4 +49 G allele and BD in Turkish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No association was found between BD and the CTLA-4 +49 A/G polymorphisms using recessive or dominant models or contrast of homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was found between BD and the CTLA-4 -318 C/T or CT60 A/G polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis showed that no association was found between CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T or CT60 A/G polymorphisms and BD </plain></SENT>
