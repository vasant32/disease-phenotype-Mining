<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analysed the potential association of the type III TGF-β receptor (TGFBR3) genetic variations (rs2489188 and rs1805110) in the Chinese Han population for patients with either Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD), two <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> entities presumably mediated by Th17 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2489188 and rs1805110, in TGFBR3 were genotyped in 451 VKH patients, 330 BD patients and 468 healthy controls using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of the two SNPs with both diseases was analysed using the chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess the influence of the gender on the association of TGFBR3 polymorphisms with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly decreased frequency of rs1805110 CC genotype (corrected P (P(c)) = 0.03, odds ratio = 0.617, 95% CI = 0.441-0.863) was observed in BD patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After logistic regression analysis, this association was maintained (P(c) = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of genotype and allele of rs2489188 were not different between VKH disease or BD patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stratification analysis according to clinical features of VKH disease or BD failed to find any association of the tested SNPs with both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that rs1805110 CC genotype in TGFBR3 is probably associated with the protection from BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The tested two TGFBR3 SNPs are not associated with VKH disease </plain></SENT>
