<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> enzyme CYP2C9 metabolizes several important drugs, such as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enzyme is polymorphic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known alleles, for example, CYP2C9*2 and*3, give decreased activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultra-high activity of the enzyme has not yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present a patient with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease who required treatment with high doses of phenytoin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>, a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9, was added to the treatment regimen, the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001350'>slurred speech</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, indicating phenytoin intoxication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On suspicion of ultra-high activity of CYP2C9, a phenotyping test for CYP2C9 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient was shown to have a higher activity of CYP2C9 than any of the 190 healthy Swedish Caucasians used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of an ultrarapid metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6541">losartan</z:chebi> and phenytoin may apply to other CYP2C9 substrates, where inhibition of CYP2C9 may cause severe adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
