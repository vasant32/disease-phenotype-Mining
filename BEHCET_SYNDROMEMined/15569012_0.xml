<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism have been described in patients with BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apo E) polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations in 30 patients with BD were compared with those of 27 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients and controls were found to be normolipidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with BD had significantly higher concentrations of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol than those of controls (P &lt; 0.05); however, there was no difference in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distribution of apo E genotypes and alleles was the same in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were slight differences in allele frequency between the groups, but this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0001556'>high HDL cholesterol levels</z:mp> observed in our patients were not related to abnormalities in apo E alleles </plain></SENT>
