<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is relatively rare and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement is seen in 5% of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) can provide information that shows the presence of clinically unsuspected lesions in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of changing the stimulus frequencies on latencies of SEP potentials and central conduction time (CCT) in patients with neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (NB) have not been studied yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, our aim was to reveal these effects to investigate whether the change of stimulus frequencies could be of convenient use in obtaining more accurate CCT estimations in SEP studies of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed median nerve SEPs of 14 patients with NB and 15 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We changed the stimulus frequency: 2 Hz, 4Hz, 6Hz and 9Hz in successive recordings and statistically compared the changes on SEP potentials and peak and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> CCT in the neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e> (NB) group and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results indicated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> CCT values of the NB group were higher than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group at 4Hz and 9Hz stimulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the comparison of peak CCT in the NB group and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group did not show any statistically meaningful differences at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stimulation frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> CCT has not been measured before in former SEP studies of patients with NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We highly recommend measuring <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> CCT at higher stimulation frequencies in order to reveal central conduction time pathologies in these patients </plain></SENT>
