<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean ET-1 plasma concentrations were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) increased in patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (35.99 +/- 5.06 fmol/ml, mean +/- standard error) compared to concentrations found in healthy volunteers (10.98 +/- 0.84 fmol/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No difference in plasma ET-1 level was observed between patients with inactive <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (12.98 +/- 1.14 fmol/ml) and volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased plasma levels of ET-1 in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be attributable to increased secretion or leakage of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> from injured vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that ET-1 may play an important pathogenetic role in the development or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> common to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of ET-1 correlates with the activity of illness </plain></SENT>
