<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Soluble CD28 concentration was determined by ELISA in 120 patients with BD (80 patients in active stage), 60 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and 60 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Concentrations of sCD28 were significantly higher in patients with BD and RA than in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with active BD expressed the highest level of sCD28 in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soluble CD28 exhibited a drastic increase in active BD patients, compared to BD in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Soluble CD28 concentrations were higher in patients with active BD patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant positive correlation was observed in a longitudinal study of 15 BD patients, between sCD28 and C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that fluctuations of sCD28 in BD reflects disease activity and should be assessed in evaluating disease activity </plain></SENT>
