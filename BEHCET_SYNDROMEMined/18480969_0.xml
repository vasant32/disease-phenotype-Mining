<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 30 Behcet's patients (52 eyes) with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aqueous flare and cells were quantified using the laser flare-cell photometry before treatment and 1 and 2 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Before treatment, mean aqueous flare (ph/ms) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s eyes was 25.7 ± 20.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment, flare values were significantly reduced after 1 and 2 months compared with those before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found between flare values after 1 and 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, mean cell counts (cells/0.5 mm(3)) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s eyes were 23.2 ± 29.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After treatment, cell counts were also significantly reduced after 1 and 2 months compared with those before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell counts were further significantly reduced from 1 to 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both aqueous flare and cells were significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>'s patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> and improved after a two-month treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier lasts longer than aqueous cells in these patients </plain></SENT>
