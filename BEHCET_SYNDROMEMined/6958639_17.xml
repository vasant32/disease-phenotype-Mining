<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of eighty Caucasian patients was divided into four groups with the mucocutaneous, arthritic, neurological and ocular types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's syndrome</z:e> (BS) and a fifth group of patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunogenetic basis of the four types of BS was extended from HLA-B locus to the DR locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas B5 and more precisely the Bw51 split is the most discriminating marker of the ocular type of BS, DR7 also shows a significant increase in the ocular and neurological types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indeed, most if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the ocular type have B5 and/or DR7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> and/or DR2 is significantly increased at the less severe end of the spectrum, the mucocutaneous and arthritic types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000155'>oral ulcers</z:hpo> also show an increase in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> and/or DR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> and/or DR7 shows an increase in the relative risk in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four types of BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HLA-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>, B5, DR7 and DR2 might in some way be associated with tissue localization of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, since patients with HLA-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> show a significantly greater ratio of IgG:IgA circulating immune complexes than those with B5/DR7/DR2, tissue localization might be influenced by the immune complex isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant relationship was also found between the MT2 and MT3 B cell alloantigen system and BS, with particular reference to MT2 and the neurological type and MT3 and the ocular type of BS </plain></SENT>
