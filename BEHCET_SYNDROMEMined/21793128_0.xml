<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the influence of age at diagnosis and sex on the clinical course and long-term prognosis of intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> (BD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 291 patients with intestinal BD who underwent regular follow-up at a single tertiary academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to their age at diagnosis of intestinal BD or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probabilities of operation, admission, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> use, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> use after diagnosis were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 291 patients, 154 (52.9%) were diagnosed with intestinal BD when younger than 40 years old, and 132 (45.4%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Younger age at diagnosis was associated with a higher leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and disease activity index for intestinal BD, and with a greater prevalence of volcano-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> and a definite diagnostic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cumulative probabilities of operation, admission, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> use were significantly higher in the younger group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Male sex was associated with a higher CRP level and a greater prevalence of volcano-shaped <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there were no significant differences in cumulative probabilities of operation, admission, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> use, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> use according to sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In intestinal BD, younger age at diagnosis is associated with a more severe clinical course and a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, although some clinical manifestations at initial diagnosis tend to be more severe in male patients, clinical outcomes do not differ significantly according to sex </plain></SENT>
