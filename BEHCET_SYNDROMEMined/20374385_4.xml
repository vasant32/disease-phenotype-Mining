<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ICBD was created in 2006 to replace the International Study Group (ISG) criteria (created in 1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, 14 existing diagnosis/classification criteria (Curth, Hewitt, Mason and Barnes, Japan original, Hubault and Hamza, O'Duffy, Cheng and Zhang, Dilsen, Japan revised, International Study Group, Iran traditional, Iran Classification Tree, revised Dilsen, Korea), were evaluated and compared to ICBD by calculating their sensitivity, specificity and accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients from the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's Disease registry (6128) and controls (3400), up to January 2008, entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was clinical and not by any of the above-mentioned criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy (percent agreement), and 95% confidence interval were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performance of ICBD and ISG were compared by the McNemar test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity was 98.2% for ICBD and 78.1% for ISG (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity was 95.6% for ICBD and 98.4% for ISG (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The accuracy was 97.3% for ICBD and 85.5% for ISG (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In Iranian patients, ICBD has 20.1% higher sensitivity and 11.8% higher accuracy than ISG, while the specificity was only 2.8% lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>ICBD was better optimized than ISG (difference between sensitivity and specificity 2.6% vs 20.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ICBD has by far better performance than ISG in Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The difference is even more prominent in Iranian patients than in the cohort of the international patients upon whom the criteria were created </plain></SENT>
