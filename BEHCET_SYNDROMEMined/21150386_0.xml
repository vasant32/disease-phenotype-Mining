<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: (a) To investigate the neurologic soft signs (NSS) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet disease</z:e> (BD) patients who had no neurologic symptoms, by using the neurologic evaluation scale (NES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(b) To evaluate the effect of silent infarction on NES scores in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty six BD patients without neurologic symptoms and 36 healthy controls were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NSS were assessed with the NES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was conducted to determine the presence of silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with BD had significantly higher scores overall and on each subscale (except for subscale "others") of the NES than the control group's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tandem walk, adventitious overflow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, graphesthesia, fist edge palm test, Ozeretski test, finger thumb opposition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001335'>mirror movements</z:hpo>, extinction, synkinesis, convergence, finger nose test, glabellar reflex, grasp reflex, and suck reflex were also significantly higher in patients with BD than in the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the total NES scores, total subscale scores and each of the NES items between BD patients with silent infarction and those without infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of neurologic involvement in BD is important and the NES is a useful instrument for detecting subclinical neurologic involvement in BD patients </plain></SENT>
