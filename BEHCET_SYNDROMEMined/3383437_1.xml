<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[3H-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>] incorporation and phospholipase A2 activity of neutrophils from active cases of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and RA were significantly increased compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In lymphocytes from the patients with active <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and RA, a significant increase in methyltransferase activity and a marked enhancement of phospholipase activity were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A modest increase in these two membrane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> enzyme activities was observed in lymphocytes of patients with active SLE </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potentiated functions of neutrophils and lymphocyte abnormalities in the patients tested thus seem to be at least partly due to an increase in these enzymatic activities in the cell membrane </plain></SENT>
