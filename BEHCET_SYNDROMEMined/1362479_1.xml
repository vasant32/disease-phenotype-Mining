<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was revealed that HLA-B 51 was closely associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigation of genetic polymorphism of TNF-beta (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-beta) showed that 95% of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients had the 10.5 kbp Nco I fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was therefore concluded that the gene of susceptibility to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is located between HLA-B and TNF-beta loci on the short arm of chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar studies of HLA-DNA typing in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> frequently seen in Japan showed that frequencies of HLA-DRB1 * 0405, HLA-DQA1 * 0301 and HLA-DQB1 * 0401 were significantly increased in patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that those who have serine at position 57 of HLA-DR, glutamic acid at position 70 and aspertic acid at position 71 of HLA-DQ respond to certain unknown agents significantly more than those without them, thus leading to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same HLA association was observed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Harada's disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sympathetic ophthalmia</z:e>, and the immunogenetic mechanism was thought to be similar in both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent immunogenetic and molecular genetic investigations on various ocular diseases have shed new light not only on the genetic individual susceptibility and biased racial differences, but also on the diagnosis of the ocular diseases, reclassification of disease entities according to HLA associations, and judgement of disease prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further progress of molecular medicine may make it possible to treat various intractable ocular diseases by gene therapy in the near future </plain></SENT>
