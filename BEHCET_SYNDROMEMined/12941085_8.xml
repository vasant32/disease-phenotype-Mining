<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Papulopustular lesions (PPL), the most common type of cutaneous lesions in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD), clinically may not be differentiated from ordinary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disagreement exists as to the exact nature of these acneiform and <z:mp ids='MP_0000376'>folliculitis</z:mp>-like lesions and whether to include them as a major criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether PPL can be a useful tool for the diagnosis of BD when non-follicular lesions over the trunk or extremities were selected, and were correlated with histological and/or immunofluorescence study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with BD (five women, 12 men; mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> age, 32 +/- 7.9 years), were enrolled in the study with blind histopathological and immunofluorescence studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsies of the PPL and adjacent (approximately 2 cm distant) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing skin were performed from the extremities and trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follicle-based acneiform lesions and those lesions over face were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation primarily included epidermal and dermal alterations, cellular infiltration and vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also performed direct immunofluorescence studies, using polyclonal antibodies for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3 and fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lesional specimens of the patients with BD revealed a significant leucocytoclastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> as compared with non-lesional skin (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vessels of the lesional skin showed a higher IgM deposition than non-lesional skin (52.9% and 17.6%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IgG, C3 and fibrin deposits on the vessels of the lesional skin were also higher than non-lesional skin (35.3, 11.8%; 41.2, 17.6%; and 47.1, 17.6%, respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that non-follicular PPL over the trunk or extremities are more specific, and immune complex-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> is likely to be the main feature of these lesions, as they are in other cutaneous lesions of BD </plain></SENT>
