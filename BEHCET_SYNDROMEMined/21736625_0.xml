<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to measured the interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and analysis of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp-3(+) Treg cells in peripheral blood from patients with BD and RAU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition; we also analysed peripheral blood from healthy subjects for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients (15 men and 15 women) with BD, 30 patients (12 men and 18 women) with RAU and 15 healthy control subjects (nine men and six women) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp-3(+) Treg cells, IL-2 and IL-6 levels have been measured in flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed in the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-6 between BD and RAU patients, and healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were no statistical differences in the number of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp-3(+) cells between groups, there were statistically significant differences in the number of CD4(+) CD25(bright) Treg cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD4(+) CD25(bright) Treg cells were significantly increased in BD and RAU patients compared to healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed no difference according to the number of CD4(+) CD25(bright) cells between BD and RAU patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CD4(+) CD25(bright) T regulatory cells may be contributing factor in the pathogenesis of BD and RAU </plain></SENT>
