<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> capillaroscopy: thirteen had direct signs of microvalvular abnormalities (nine cases with two direct signs and at least two indirect signs; and four cases with two direct and one indirect, or one direct and three indirect signs) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We never observed any abnormality in the number of the capillaries, in the sweat droplets nor in the circulatory speed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no correlation between the capillaroscopic abnormalities and the age, sex, duration of the disease, or ethnic background </plain></SENT>
