<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to clarify when KD appeared in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We investigated the medical charts of patients who had been hospitalized at Tokyo University Hospital between 1940 and 1965 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 10 patients whose clinical signs fulfilled the criteria for KD </plain></SENT>
