<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) is known to be associated with HLA-B51 in many different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>, a member of a novel family of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes termed MIC (MHC class I chain-related genes), was identified near the HLA-B gene, and a triplet repeat microsatellite polymorphism was found in the transmembrane (TM) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because a strong association with BD of one particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM allele, A6, was shown in a Japanese population, the present study was conducted to investigate microsatellite polymorphism in Greek patients with BD to know whether this association is generally observed in BD occurring in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight Greek patients with BD and 40 ethnically matched control subjects were examined for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> microsatellite polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent automated fragment detection by fluorescent-based technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similar to the Japanese patients with BD, the phenotype frequency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM A6 allele was significantly increased in the Greek patients with BD (50.0% in control subjects versus 86.8% in BD cases), with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.60 (P = 0.0012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6 allele was found in a high frequency both in males and females (weighted OR = 6.68; P = 0.0017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was found between the A6 allele and several disease features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A strong association exists between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM A6 allele and the B*5101 allele in both the control subjects and patients with BD (weighted OR = 44.39; P = 0.0000023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed in Greek patients a strong association of BD with a particular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-TM allele, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e>-A6, providing insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the development of BD </plain></SENT>
