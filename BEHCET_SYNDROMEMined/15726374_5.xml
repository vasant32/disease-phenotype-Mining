<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> in which studies have given conflicting results about ventricular diastolic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, tissue Doppler echocardiography has never been used in any of these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e>, may also precede ventricular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess aortic stiffness and biventricular diastolic functions in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 26 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease (mean age; 33+/-10 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age; 33+/-7 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aortic stiffness was evaluated by aortic strain and distensibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular diastolic functions were evaluated with both conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mitral E and A wave, E/A ratio of E wave, deceleration time, and isovolumic relaxation time were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in diastolic Doppler parameters between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no significant difference in mitral annular E and A velocities between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Aortic strain in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was found to be significantly less than in the controls (8.3+/-4.9% and 15.7+/-2.7% respectively, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aortic distensibility was also significantly low in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease when compared to controls (0.45+/-0.28 and 0.78+/-0.13 respectively, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Beta index values were significantly high in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's patients (7.23+/-5.93 and 2.69+/-0.55 respectively, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No significant diastolic dysfunction was found in left and right ventricles in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease by using both conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, an increase in aortic stiffness was found, suggesting an inflammatory involvement of proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
