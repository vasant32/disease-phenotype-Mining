<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inflammatory character, central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathies</z:e> of BD led to this investigation of RLS risk in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 116 BD patients and 104 healthy control subjects were included; seven BD patients were excluded because of concurrent diseases, pregnancy or alcohol misuse that might cause RLS symptoms, and the remaining 109 BD patients were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of RLS was significantly higher in patients with BD (32/109; 29.4%) than in controls (5/104; 4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between BD patients with and without RLS with regard to the clinical features of BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RLS severity positively correlated with age in BD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, BD-related RLS should be considered in symptomatic RLS secondary to rheumatological disorders and BD patients should be examined for RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying BD-related RLS </plain></SENT>
