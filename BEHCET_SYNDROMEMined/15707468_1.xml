<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients, skin symptoms precede serious visceral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 78 patients whose mean age was 33.48 +/- 6.16 (21-48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the cases, 37 were females and 41 were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (53.8%) had EN-like lesion and 12 (15.3%) had ST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of 54 patients, who had EN-like lesion and ST, were found to have no visceral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six of the remaining 48 patients, it was established that visceral involvement developed before lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found in 42 patients that these two lesions preceded visceral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, 18 of 24 patients who did not have these two lesions, do not still have visceral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we think that EN-like lesion and ST can be guiding in predicting serious visceral involvement and complications that can develop in advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
