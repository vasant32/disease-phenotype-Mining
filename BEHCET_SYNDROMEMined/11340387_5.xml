<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To elucidate factors related to ocular inflammatory attacks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery, limited to a single procedure of phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study included 12 consecutive patients (16 eyes) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease, who underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation during 4 years from January 1995 to December 1998 at three institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their medical records were reviewed, and factors related to the ocular attacks were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four eyes of 3 patients experienced ocular attacks during 1 year before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery, while 4 eyes of 4 patients developed ocular attacks during 1 year after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The development of ocular attacks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery was significantly related with the presence of ocular attacks during 1 year before the surgery (p = 0.0286, chi(2) test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' age or gender, the duration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease or oral medications for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease did not show any relationship with the presence or absence of ocular attacks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after the surgery, including those who developed ocular attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The experience of ocular attacks during 1 year before <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> surgery is related to postoperative ocular attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite postoperative ocular attacks, phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation is a safe procedure to expect a good visual outcome in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet disease </plain></SENT>
