<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>Aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is rare, and prosthetic valve detachment after aortic valve replacement is one of the most serious complications reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the surgical results of valved conduit operation in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1987 and April 1999, 8 patients underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 7 males and 1 female, and their ages ranged from 33 to 60 years (mean, 48 +/- 10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The valved conduit procedure was a modified Bentall operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> during the hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period in the other 7 patients ranged from 1 to 138 months after surgery (mean, 74 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of these 7 patients died during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Valve detachment needing redo-operation occurred in 1 patient, and he underwent a valved conduit operation again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Valved conduit reconstruction is indicated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, in whom prevention of valve detachment is difficult even by current valve fixation methods </plain></SENT>
