<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) pathway is likely involved in the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the 2 TNFalpha receptors is TNF receptor superfamily 1A (TNFRSF1A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We searched for R92Q TNFRSF1A mutations in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A search for TNFRSF1A mutations was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the TNFRSF1A gene, followed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 74 unrelated European patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease, 5 (6.8%) carried the R92Q TNFRSF1A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the R92Q mutation in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease was significantly higher than that in controls (P = 0.006 by Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>Deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was significantly associated with the R92Q mutation (P = 0.001 [with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 30 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 10 had cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of these patients had the R92Q mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 20 patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease who had extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, 6 had the R92Q mutation, whereas 14 did not (P &lt; 0.0001) CONCLUSION: The R92Q mutation in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease is associated with an increased risk of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This new finding may help in understanding the complex prothrombotic state in patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
