<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, CD4+ T helper cells have been categorized into at least two distinct subsets based on their profiles of cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the number of interleukin (IL)-2 producing type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and IL-4 producing Th2 cells from 22 patients (male: 12, female: 10) with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease and 19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (male: 9) by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease were categorized into two groups by the activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo>; one group comprised the active cases (13 patients) and the other the inactive cases (9 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 mAb for 6 hours and immunostained with anti IL-2 and anti IL-4 mAbs followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>) conjugated 2nd Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of IL-2 producing CD4+ cells in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease patients with active uveoretinitis was significantly higher than that from both inactive cases (p &lt; 0.005) and controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the number of IL-4 producing CD4+ cells showed no significant difference among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results may indicate that Th1 cells play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100533'>ocular inflammation</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, analysis of Th subsets in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease may be useful for management of the disease </plain></SENT>
