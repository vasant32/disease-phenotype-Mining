We examined the efficacy and host response to the adenovirus (Ad)-mediated delivery of human apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) gene to the liver of APOA1(-/-) mice. Administration of a first-generation vector (FGAd-AI) resulted in a transient appearance of APOA1 in plasma and induced an anti-APOA1 antibody titer, whereas treatment with a helper-dependent vector (HDAd-AI) resulted in sustained APOA1 expression without inducing an antibody titer. With these results, we studied the effects of FGAd vectors on APOAI expression by HDAd-AI vector. Co-treatment with an FGAd vector inhibited HDAd-AI- mediated APOA1 expression independent of transgene cassettes, but only FGAd-AI induced a humoral response. Furthermore, APOA1 mRNA levels in mice co-treated with FGAd vectors were much lower than those expected from the vector copy number, suggesting that DNA of FGAd vectors interferes with the HDAd-AI vector's APOA1 promoter. A single treatment with an HDAd-AI vector produced a supraphysiological plasma APOA1 level that gradually declined to about half the normal human level over the course of 2 years, associated with a plasma cholesterol level that is persistently higher than that in controls. This investigation provides the proof of principle that liver-directed HDAd gene delivery is effective for the long-term phenotypic correction of monogenic hypoalphalipoproteinemia.
