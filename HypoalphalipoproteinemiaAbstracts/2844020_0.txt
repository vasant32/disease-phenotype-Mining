Thermo-induced structural reorganization in human high density lipoproteins subclasses HDL2 and HDL3 have been studied by means of electronic paramagnetic resonance method. A number of spin labels were used: 5- and 16-DOXYL stearates, DOXYL-labelled derivatives of pentadecane, phosphatidyl choline and sphingomyelin. In hypoalphalipoproteinemia one of the thermo-induced transitions in HDL2 (at 23-30 degrees) was not observed. In coronary heart disease the critical temperature for HDL3 was shifted from the physiological values and located at 42-48 degrees. The data obtained are discussed from the point of view of their potential role in atherogenesis.
