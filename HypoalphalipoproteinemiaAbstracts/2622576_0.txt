Data in the literature suggest that cases of hypoalphalipoproteinemia involve an increase in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) together with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. A recent detailed examination of a 32-year-old man revealed clinical and biochemical features strongly indicative of that pathology. The case presented several unusual features: marked infiltration of the skin and mesenteric lymph nodes by histiocytic lipids with sufficient hyperplasia to induce acute intestinal occlusion combined with an in vivo TXB2 generation curve, subsequently inhibited by aspirin, that was comparable to the curves of the control subjects. Furthermore there were no signs of early atherosclerotic damage so that it was possible to postulate the hypothesis that despite the 50% drop in alpha-lipoprotein levels, they were still sufficient to ensure normal turnover of the other lipoproteins so that, however complex the clinical condition, it was an incomplete expression of a phenotype.
