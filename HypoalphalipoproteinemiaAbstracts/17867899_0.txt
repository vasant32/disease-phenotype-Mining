OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of sex in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with lipodystrophy and its association with cardiovascular risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV-infected patients aged 20 or over managed at the outpatient Infectious Disease Unit in 2003. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection, lipodystrophy and cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 760 patients included in the study, women comprised 28%. Men with lipodystrophy had a higher prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia than those without lipodystrophy. Women with lipodystrophy had a higher prevalence of central obesity and hypertriglyceridemia compared with those without lipodystrophy (22.8 vs. 11.2%, p = 0.000; 20.6 vs. 9.3%, p = 0.001; 39.7 vs. 30%, p = 0.03 y 56.6 vs. 40.9%, p = 0.0001, respectively). The lipoatrophy pattern was predominant in men (24.9 vs. 12.6%, p = 0.0001) and lipoaccumulation forms in women (12.3 vs. 22.6%, p = 0.0001). Furthermore, women were younger, had a higher prevalence of smoking, family history of premature coronary heart disease and central obesity, and a lower prevalence of hypertension and hypoalphalipoproteinemia than men with lipodystrophy (42.1 +/- 8 years vs. 44.8 +/- 9.9 years, p = 0.03; 77.5 vs. 64%, p = 0.04; 22.5 vs. 9%, p = 0.003; 31 vs. 8.5%, p = 0.0001; 9.9 vs. 22.8%, p = 0.01; 25.4 vs. 39.7%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the influence of sex in lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients affects not only the lipodystrophy pattern, but also the cardiovascular risk profile.
