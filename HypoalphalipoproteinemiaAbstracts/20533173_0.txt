The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a membrane-bound protein that is abundant in macrophages and is essential for the first step of reverse cholesterol transport and maintenance of homeostasis of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-bound cholesterol. Low serum HDL levels are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Homozygous and heterozygous mutations in the ABCA1 gene may be associated with increased atherosclerosis. Here we report about two heterozygous mutations c.5398A>C and c.2369G>A in the ABCA1 gene associated with HDL cholesterol deficiency in serum.
