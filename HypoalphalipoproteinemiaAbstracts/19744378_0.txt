 OBJECTIVE: to describe the different clinical profiles of patients with dyslipidemia based on lipid phenotype, in an urban setting. METHODS: a survey was carried out among college students and general population. A structured interview was conducted. Blood was drawn for glucose and lipid profile from subjects considered to be healthy. RESULTS: we included 1286 subjects. They were grouped by socioeconomic status (low income = 437, medium income = 162 and high income = 133) and 554 college students who had lived in the area for at least one year. Women composed 61 % of the cohort; 86 % of the cases were studied after an overnight fasting period. The prevalent lipid phenotype was hypoalphalipoproteinemia, followed by mixed hyperlipidemia. Among medium income group, isolated hypercholesterolemia was a common finding. High fasting glucose and low c-HDL were observed among the low income group. Male gender and age are predictors for hypercholesterolemia. The BMI is the only identified predictor of hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 10.089). We identified that age > 55-year old (OR = 2.6), male gender (OR = 1.6), and sedentary life (OR = 1.35), were predictors of hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Conclusion: the most common lipid phenotype was hypoalphalipoproteinemia.
