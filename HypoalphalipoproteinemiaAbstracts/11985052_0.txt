Hyperlipidemia, especially hypercholesterolemia is one of the most important risk factors for coronary heart disease. Now it is well recognized that aggressive lipid-lowering drug treatment in high-risk individuals reduces coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality rates and increases overall survival. Hypertriglyceridemia has now been recognized as another important risk factor for coronary heart disease. Recently, much attention has been focused on the atherogenesis of small, dense LDL, remnant lipoprotein and isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is known to be deeply involved in the pathogenesis of all of these abnormal lipoprotein profiles. Therefore, treatment of hypertriglyceridemia as well as hypercholesterolemia must be fully discussed. In this issue, I will talk about new insights into treatment of dyslipidemia by changing the life style and/or by various hypolipidemic drugs.
