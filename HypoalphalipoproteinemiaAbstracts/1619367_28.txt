Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I is the major protein constituent of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL). A kindred has been identified in which a glycine to arginine mutation at residue 26 in apoA-I is associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hereditary systemic amyloidosis. We isolated the mutant protein, termed apoA-IIowa, from the plasma of an affected subject and studied its in vivo metabolism compared to that of normal apoA-I in two heterozygous apoA-IIowa subjects and two normal controls. Normal and mutant apoA-I were radioiodinated with 131I and 125I, respectively, reassociated with autologous plasma lipoproteins, and simultaneously injected into all subjects. Kinetic analysis of the plasma radioactivity curves demonstrated that the mutant apoA-IIowa was rapidly cleared from plasma (mean fractional catabolic rate [FCR] 0.559 day-1) compared with normal apoA-I (mean FCR 0.244 day-1) in all four subjects. The FCR of normal apoA-I was also substantially faster in the heterozygous apoA-IIowa subjects (mean FCR 0.281 days-1) than in the normal controls (mean FCR 0.203 days-1). Despite the rapid removal from plasma of apoA-IIowa, the cumulative urinary excretion of its associated radioactivity after 2 weeks (44%) of the injected dose) was substantially less than that associated with normal apoA-I (78% of injected dose), indicating extravascular sequestration of radiolabeled apoA-IIowa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
