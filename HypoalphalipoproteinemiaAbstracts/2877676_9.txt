Two restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein A-I-C-III gene complex were defined by digestion with PstI and SacI in a family with hypoalphalipoproteinemia. These polymorphisms established a PstI + /SacI - haplotype which may constitute a linkage marker for this condition within the family.
