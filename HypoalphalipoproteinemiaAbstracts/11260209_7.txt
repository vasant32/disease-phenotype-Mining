Defects in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene are associated with dyslipidemia in the general population. Several rare mutations in the gene, as well as two common coding region polymorphisms, D9N and N291S, exhibit deleterious effects on circulating lipid levels. Using a linkage-based approach, we have identified a large Utah kindred segregating the D9N variant in the LPL gene. The kindred was ascertained for premature coronary heart disease and was expanded based on familial dyslipidemia. A genomic scan identified a region of linkage including LPL, and mutation screening identified the segregating variant. In the kindred, the variant shows high penetrance for a hypoalphalipoproteinemia phenotype, but is also associated with hypertriglyceridemia and elevated insulin levels. The strength of linkage was dependent on the combination of phenotype definition and model parameters, favoring the use of a MOD score approach. Most other studies of LPL have proceeded by mutation screening of randomly chosen individuals or selected affected probands; this is the first example identifying a segregating LPL mutation using direct linkage.
