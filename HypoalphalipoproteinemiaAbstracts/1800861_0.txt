BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the percentage of individuals with hypoalphalipoproteinemia and isolated hypertriglyceridemia which would not be detected if only total cholesterol were included in the initial detection of dyslipemia. METHODS: Five hundred forty-one individuals participating in a study concerning factors of cardiovascular risk were included in the present study which consisted in a survey on risk factors and a medical examination. The population studied was divided according to the concentration of total cholesterol (TC) in desirable concentrations (5.2 mmol/l), intermediate (5.2-6.2 mmol/l) and elevated (6.2 mmol/l). The concentrations of cholesterol bound to high density lipoproteins (cHDL) less than 0.9 mmol/l and of triglycerides (TG) greater than 2.3 mmol/l were considered as high risk. RESULTS: Hypoalphalipoproteinemia would not be detected in 2.9% of the population studied (IC 95%: 1.5%-4.3%) and isolated triglyceridemia in 2.4% (IC 95%: 1.1%-3.7%) if the cHDL and the TG were only determined in the individuals who had high or elevated CT concentrations and two or more cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the efficacy of CT as the only test for initial detection of dyslipemia and question the convenience of initial quantification of cHDL and triglycerides in all cases as some authors request.
