We have devised a combined in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approach to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the hypoalphalipoproteinemia in heterozygous carriers of a naturally occurring apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) variant (Leu(159) to Arg) known as apoA-I Finland (apoA-I(FIN)). Adenovirus-mediated expression of apoA-I(FIN) decreased apoA-I and high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in both wild-type C57BL/6J mice and in apoA-I-deficient mice expressing native human apoA-I (hapoA-I). Interestingly, apoA-I(FIN) was degraded in the plasma, and the extent of proteolysis correlated with the most significant reductions in murine apoA-I concentrations. ApoA-I(FIN) had impaired activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in vitro compared with hapoA-I, but in a mixed lipoprotein preparation consisting of both hapoA-I and apoA-I(FIN) there was only a moderate reduction in the activation of this enzyme. Importantly, secretion of apoA-I was also decreased from primary apoA-I-deficient hepatocytes when hapoA-I was co-expressed with apoA-I(FIN) following infection with recombinant adenoviruses, a condition that mimics secretion in heterozygotes. Thus, this is the first demonstration of an apoA-I point mutation that decreases LCAT activation, impairs hepatocyte secretion of apoA-I, and makes apoA-I susceptible to proteolysis leading to dominantly inherited hypoalphalipoproteinemia.
