The authors present the results of first screening of random sample of population aged 35-64 years of two Warsaw districts (Praga South and Praga North). The screening was performed within framework of the international WHO-MONICA Project in 1984. 1309 men and 1337 women were screened (response rate 72.7% and 74.3%). Standardized mean values of plasma triglycerides concentration were found significantly higher and those of plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration significantly lower in male than in female sample. In men there was also higher the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia, and hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Standardized mean values of plasma total cholesterol concentration and prevalence of hypercholesterolemia did not differ significantly between men and women. The mean values of lipid concentration and prevalence of lipid metabolism disturbances increased with age in men whereas in men such trend was not observed. The influence of selected factors on lipids and lipoproteins plasma concentration was evaluated by means of multivariate regression analysis. Quetelet index, cigarettes smoking and level of education were the most strongly associated with a lipid pattern which increases risk of cardiovascular diseases both in men and women.
