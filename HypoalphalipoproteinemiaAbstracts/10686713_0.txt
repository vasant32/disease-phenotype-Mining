OBJECTIVE: Hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HA) is a relatively frequent disorder found in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). It is associated to a greater risk of suffering recurrent coronary episodes and of mortality caused by this disease. METHODS: We selected 60 patients with previous CAD and isolated HA (HDLc concentration < 0.9 mmol/L, and desirable lipidic profile) that were consecutively seen in a specialized lipid clinic. Subjects were randomly included in the two groups of cases (group of intervention) and controls. Cases were treated with non-pharmacological measures which included changes in lifestyle and dietary habits. Control subjects were referred to their general practitioners in order to receive conventional medical care. RESULTS: It was demonstrated a significant increase in the HDLc concentration in both groups, being greater the improvement in the group of intervention, but the differences in the increase in the HDLc between both groups were not significant. Fibrinogen was lower in the patients of the group of intervention, especially in those patients that gave up smoking. CONCLUSION: Changes in lifestyle and dietary habits are useful to correct the low HDLc plasma levels and to reduce fibrinogen levels in those patients with CAD and HA.
