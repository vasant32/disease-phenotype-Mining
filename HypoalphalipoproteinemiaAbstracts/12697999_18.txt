The ABCA subfamily of ABC transporters includes ten members to date. In this study, we describe an additional gene, ABCA12. Four full-length cDNA sequences have been obtained from human placenta that contain two different polyadenylation sites and two splicing forms, coding for ABCA12 isoforms of 2,595 and 2,516 amino acid residues. Both isoforms are predicted to have two ATP-binding domains (nucleotide binding domain, NBD) and two transmembrane (TM) domains, features shared by all other ABCA subfamily proteins. ABCA12 is most closely related to ABCA1, with an amino acid similarity of 47%. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that a 9.5-kb transcript is mainly expressed in the stom- ach. ABCA12 was mapped to human chromosome 2q34. Two other genes from ABCA subfamily are associated with human inherited diseases, ABCA1 with the cholesterol transport disorders Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, and ABCA4 with several retinal degeneration disorders. The ABCA12 gene is located in a region of chromosome 2q34 that harbors the genes for lamellar ichthyosis, polymorphic congenital cataract, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM13), and therefore is a positional candidate for these pathologies.
