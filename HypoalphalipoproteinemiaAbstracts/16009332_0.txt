The ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) is a trans-membrane peptide that is involved in the lipidification of ApoA-I. ABCA1 gene was initially implicated in Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia and has been shown to be associated with coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis as well. Recently, a haplotype in ABCA1 gene was associated with increased risk of type II diabetes mellitus (DM). In this report, a relationship between ApoA-I, DM and ABCA1 has been emphasized.
