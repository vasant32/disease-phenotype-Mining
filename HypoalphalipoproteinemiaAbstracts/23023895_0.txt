Cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death around the world, including Singapore. Current treatment strategies primarily target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and high triglyceride (TG) levels have been shown to increase the risk of coronary heart disease, but the clinical benefits of raising low HDL cholesterol have only been proven in a limited number of studies. This guide provides an approach on managing low HDL cholesterol levels in terms of lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy.
