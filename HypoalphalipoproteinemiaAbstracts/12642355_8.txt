 BACKGROUND: Prospective studies have examined the relationship between coronary artery disease and low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the causes of hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HypoA; HDL-C <5th percentile) in 64 subjects (12 women and 52 men). Apolipoprotein AI-mediated cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux were measured in fibroblasts from HypoA subjects, 9 controls, 2 patients with Tangier disease, and 5 patients with hyperalphalipoproteinemia. A phospholipid efflux defect was defined as <70% of controls. Mean HDL-C was 0.49+/-0.21 mmol/L. Cholesterol and phospholipid efflux correlated strongly (r=0.72, P<0.001). Phospholipid efflux and HDL-C (r=0.64, P<0.001) correlated in HypoA subjects. However, phospholipid or cholesterol efflux was no longer a determinant of HDL-C levels at higher levels (> approximately 1.0 mmol/L) of HDL-C. In HypoA subjects, 4 cases of Tangier disease and 6 of familial HDL deficiency (heterozygous Tangier disease) were identified (10 of 64; 16%). In the remaining 54 subjects, mean lipid efflux was not significantly different from controls and subjects with hyperalphalipoproteinemia. A phospholipid efflux defect was identified in 7 additional HypoA subjects, and a cholesterol efflux defect was detected in 11 subjects. In 2 of these subjects, the ABCA1 gene was ruled out as the cause of the efflux defect, while in 3, the low HDL-C trait segregated with the ABCA1 gene locus. CONCLUSIONS: Lipidation of lipid-poor apolipoprotein AI may not be a major determinant of cholesterol accumulation within more mature HDL particles and increasing cholesterol or phospholipid efflux beyond normal levels may not lead to increase in plasma HDL-C levels. ABCA1 is essential in the initial steps of HDL formation but other plasma events are major modulators of HDL-C levels.
