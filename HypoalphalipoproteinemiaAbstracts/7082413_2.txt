This study describes a variant of hypo-alpha-lipoproteinemia in a 57-year-old male patient. The total plasma cholesterol level was 258 mg/dl with 64% in esterified form. The concentration of triglycerides was 205 mg/dl. The lipoprotein electrophoretic pattern revealed the absence of alpha-lipoproteins, whereas the other lipoproteins showed an intermediate electrophoretic mobility. The concentration of HDL cholesterol (heparin: MgCl2 precipitation) was extremely low (3 mg/dl). The activity of lecithin; cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and the postheparinlipolytic activity were within the normal range. Determination of apolipoproteins revealed a marked deficiency of both apoprotein A-I (17 mg/dl) and apolipoprotein A-II (11 mg/dl). The concentration of apolipoprotein-B was elevated (186 mg/dl). Unlike the clinical manifestations of Tangier disease, our patient did not show skin lesion, abnormal tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly, peripheral neurologic abnormalities or corneal deposits. Also in contrast to Tangier disease our patient had coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction accompanied with severe occlusive peripheral arterial disease.
