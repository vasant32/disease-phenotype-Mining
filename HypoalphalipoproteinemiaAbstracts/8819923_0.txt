As many as 450 countrymen 20 to 59 years old were examined. They underwent the following measurements: concentration of total cholesterin, triglycerides, cholesterol of high-, low- and very low dencity lipoproteins; there has also been studied the incidence of dyslipoproteinemias. The prevalence of atherogenic and antiatherogenic dyslipoproteinemias is as follows: 8.3 % (type II a), 1.6 % (type 11 b), 0.2 % (type III), 7.4 % (type IV), 1.1 % (type V) 11 % (hyperalphalipoproteinemia), 3.6 % (hypoalphalipoproteinemia), and 6.1 % (hypobetalipoproteinemia), as evidenced by phenotyping studies. A substantial proportion of examenees (59.5 %) are those individuals with normolipoproteinemia.
