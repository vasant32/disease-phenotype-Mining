BACKGROUND: Low plasma concentrations of HDLs are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Two uncontrolled studies suggested that plant monoterpenes may have substantial HDL-cholesterol-elevating activity in humans. Each study used a proprietary mixture of 6 monoterpenes in olive oil. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to test more rigorously the hypothesis that monoterpenes raise HDL concentrations in men with hypoalphalipoproteinemia. DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design was used. Twenty-four men aged 58-68 y (x: 62.3 y) with plasma HDL cholesterol <1.1 mmol/L, plasma triacylglycerols <3.5 mmol/L, and plasma total cholesterol <5.5 mmol/L at recruitment were randomly assigned to 6 capsules daily of a proprietary mixture of 6 monoterpenes in olive oil or 6 capsules daily of olive oil alone for 24 wk, followed by a washout period of 8 wk, and then the alternative capsules for 24 wk. RESULTS: Five men dropped out. In the others, compliance was excellent as judged by capsule counts and urinary menthol glucuronide concentrations. No significant effects were observed on plasma HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein A-I concentrations, nor on plasma triacylglycerol, LDL-cholesterol, or apolipoprotein B concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Plant monoterpenes have no HDL-elevating activity of potential value for coronary artery disease prevention.
