Cholesteryl ester transfer from solid-phase bound HDL to endogenous plasma HDL or VLDL/LDL was determined in 50 patients with primary disorders of lipid metabolism and 27 normolipidemic subjects. Transfer to the plasma HDL pool was significantly reduced in familial hypercholesterolemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia and dysbetalipoproteinemia. Subfractionation of HDL revealed that the lipid transfer to HDL3 was significantly reduced in all patient groups while transfer to HDL2 was increased in those with dysbetalipoproteinemia and familial hypertriglyceridemia. Transfer to LDL and VLDL was increased only in patients with dysbetalipoproteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Reduced transfer to HDL occurred in samples with altered HDL composition; particularly where HDL-triglyceride was significantly increased and HDL-cholesteryl esters were reduced. Transfer of cholesteryl ester to HDL3 was significantly decreased in patients with vascular disease. These findings indicate that impaired interaction of cholesteryl ester transfer protein with the HDL3 pool may contribute to the risk of coronary heart disease in patients with specific plasma lipid abnormalities.
