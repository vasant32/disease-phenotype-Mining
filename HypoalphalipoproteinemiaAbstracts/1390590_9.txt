Hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HPAL) with mild hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is associated with increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The aim of this study was to examine the metabolism of postprandial lipoproteins in HPAL/HTG subjects (n = 21). They had a fasting plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level < 0.9 mmol/l, a triglycerides (TG) level of 2.0-7.1 mmol/l, and a normal low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level (< 3.7 mmol/l). They were either homozygous for apoprotein E3 (n = 13) or heterozygous for apoprotein E4 (n = 5) or E2 (n = 3). After ingestion of a vitamin A fat load, plasma and chylomicron (CM) retinyl palmitate (RP) response (areas under curves) was three times and non-CM RP response 2.5 times greater than in normolipidemic control subjects (n = 13). There was close correlation between fasting plasma TG level and postprandial RP response in HPAL/HTG subjects (plasma, r = 0.87; CM, r = 0.89; and non-CM, r = 0.84). In control subjects this correlation was present for plasma RP (r = 0.80) and CM RP (r = 0.61) but not for non-CM RP (r = 0.53). In contrast, postprandial RP response was not correlated with fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels for both groups. There was also no correlation between fasting TG and fasting HDL cholesterol. Postheparin lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities were slightly higher in HPAL/HTG subjects. The pattern of postprandial change in HDL composition was similar to that in control subjects. These data indicate enhanced postprandial lipemia in the HPAL/HTG syndrome, and this may account for their increased CAD risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
