Phospholipid transfer protein gene knock-out (Pltp KO) mice have defective transfer of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) phospholipids into high density lipoprotein (HDL) and markedly decreased HDL levels (Jiang et al. 1999. J. Clin. Invest. 103: 907-914). These animals also accumulated VLDL- and LDL-sized lipoproteins on a high saturated fat diet. The goals of this study were to further characterize the abnormal lipoproteins of Pltp KO mice and to determine the mechanisms responsible for low HDL levels. A lipoprotein fraction enriched in lamellar structures was isolated from the low density lipoprotein (LDL) region and was shown to be phospholipid- and free cholesterol-rich and to have apoA-IV (55%) and apoE (25%) as major apolipoproteins. The lamellar lipoproteins accumulating in these mice probably represent surface material derived from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL). The HDL was found to be protein-rich (primarily apoA-I) and specifically depleted in phosphatidylcholine (PC) (28% in wild-type mice (WT) vs. 15% in Pltp KO mice, P < 0.001). Unexpectedly, turnover studies using autologous HDL revealed a profound 4-fold increase in the catabolism of HDL protein and cholesteryl ester in Pltp KO mice compared to wild-type, with minor differences in synthesis rates. In contrast, injection of WT mouse HDL into Pltp KO mice showed only a 2-fold increase in fractional catabolism. Reminiscent of the defect in Tangier disease, the failure of transfer of PC from TRL into the HDL fraction results in dramatic hypercatabolism of HDL. These results suggest that defective phospholipid transfer from TRL into HDL, arising from decreased lipolysis or decreased PLTP activity, could lead to hypoalphalipoproteinemia characterized by hypercatabolism of HDL protein. lipoprotein levels, due to hypercatabolism, and accumulate apoA-IV-rich lamellar lipoproteins.
