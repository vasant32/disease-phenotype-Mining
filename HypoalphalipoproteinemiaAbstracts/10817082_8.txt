BACKGROUND: Results of some epidemiologic studies in Western countries have clarified that hyperhomocysteinemia is a plausible risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease, but its role in Japanese communities is not known. DESIGN: A community-based cross-sectional design. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 474 elderly men aged 60-74 years in two Japanese rural communities (Noichi in southwestern Japan and Ikawa in northeastern Japan). We examined the association between plasma concentrations of homocysteine and the maximum intima-media thickness (assessed by ultrasonography). RESULTS: The prevalence of thickening was 10.7% for the lowest tertile of homocysteine level and 21.1% for the highest tertile. For the subjects without hypertension, the odds ratio for having carotid intima-media thickening was 5.8; it was significantly higher for the highest tertile of homocysteine level than it was for the lowest after adjusting for age, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, diabetes, and smoking by using a multiple logistic regression model. However, its correlation was not evident for those with hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of plasma homocysteine are correlated to extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis in elderly men without hypertension in Japanese rural communities.
