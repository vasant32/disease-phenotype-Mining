In previous studies, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) has been identified using MspI restriction endonuclease in the 3' region of the apo A-II gene. The rare variant site for this MspI (M2) has been reported to be associated with higher levels of HDL cholesterol and apo A-II. We have studied the frequency and lipid associations of this RFLP in a population of 168 coronary artery disease (CAD) male and female patients, who had more than 50% narrowing of one or more arteries prior to age 60 years, as well as 255 aged-matched males and females from the Framingham Offspring Study. We also studied 31 kindreds in which the proband had premature CAD. The frequency of the M2 allele was higher in CAD cases (0.20) than in the controls (0.13) (P less than 0.05). In general, those subjects carrying the M2 allele had lower HDL cholesterol and apo A-I plasma levels; however, this difference was only significant (P less than 0.02 and 0.002, respectively) in females with CAD. No cosegregation of the M2 allele with hypoalphalipoproteinemia was found in 31 kindreds studied. However, in both generations there was a trend for those subjects carrying the M2 allele to have lower HDL cholesterol levels than those carrying the M1 allele. Sequence analysis of the apo A-II gene of subjects homozygous for either the M1 (n = 1) or the M2 allele (n = 2) revealed that this RFLP is due to a T----C single base mutation 528 bp 3' to the apo A-II gene. In the subjects homozygous for the M2 allele no other mutations were found within the coding region of the apo A-II gene that could result in changes in the primary sequence of the protein. These data indicate that the MspI RFLP 3' to the apo A-II gene is somewhat more frequent in the CAD group. However, there was no significant association between this RFLP and any of the parameters examined. In conclusion, this DNA marker lacks the specificity to be clinically useful for CAD risk assessment in the population studied.
