Isolated low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is associated with arterial endothelium dysfunction. Several studies have shown that cholesterol lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia improves endothelial function, but the effect of treating low HDLc levels remains unknown. We studied the effect of increasing HDLc on endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and isolated low HDLc (HDLc) <0.91 mM, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) <4.1 mM, and triglycerides <2.8 mM. Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) in response to reactive hyperemia was measured by brachial ultrasound, before and after bezafibrate treatment (400 mg daily for 6 months) in 16 patients with CAD and impaired FMD (<10%). After bezafibrate therapy, HDLc increased from 0.79-1.0 mM (p = 0.0008) at the expense of both HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions, apolipoprotein A-I increased from 1.04-1.19 g/l (p = 0.0012), and fibrinogen decreased from 4.45-3.39 g/l (p = 0.0007). The impaired FMD increased after bezafibrate treatment from a median of 2.5-12.3% (p = 0.0004). Endothelial function was normalized in eight patients (50%), improved in four (25%), and did not change in four (25%). These observations indicate that in patients with isolated low HDLc and CAD, bezafibrate treatment improves endothelial function of brachial arteries, increases HDLc and apolipoprotein A-I, and lowers fibrinogen concentrations.
