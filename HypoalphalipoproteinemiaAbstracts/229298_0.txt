Examination of 50 males aged from 40 to 59 years showed that an increase or decrease in the level of cholesterol of high-density lipoproteins (HDLP) occurs mostly at the expense of cholesterol of the HDLP2 subfraction. Changes in the concentration of sex hormones in the blood plasma are attended by a change in the number of HDLP2 particles, evidence of which was a change in the content of HDLP2 cholesterol and phospholipids with the level of HDLP3 cholesterol and phospholipids remaining unaltered. A higher content is attended by a rise in the level of HDLP2 cholesterol and HDLP2 phospholipids. A negative correlation between the level of estradiol and that of triglycerides in blood plasma (r=-0.61; p less than 0.01) and a positive correlation between the content of estradiol and the level of HDLP2 cholesterol and phospholipids (r=+0.34; p less than 0.05 and r=+0.37; p less than 0.05, respectively were revealed in males with estradiol concentration of 1--8 ng/dl. There was no correlation between the above-mentioned values when the concentration of estradiol in blood plasma was higher (8--16 ng/dl). In hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia, the relation in very low density lipoproteins of apoprotein SH, which inhibits lipoprotein lipase, and apoprotein SP, which activates this enzyme, was higher than normal while the relation of these apoproteins in HDLP was lower.
