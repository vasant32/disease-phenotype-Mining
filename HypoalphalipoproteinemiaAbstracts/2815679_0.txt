Both subfraction "2" of high density lipoproteins (HDL2) from patients with hypo-alpha-lipoproteinemia and subfraction HDL3 from persons with normal content of cholesterol were shown to accept the erythrocyte membranes cholesterol in vitro. Under these conditions HDL3 subfraction was transformed into HDL2-like particles, where content of unesterified cholesterol and its esters was increased simultaneously with enlargement of the particles size. The HDL subfraction, isolated from persons with high content of cholesterol, did not accept cholesterol under the experimental conditions. Apoprotein E, containing in the HDL subfractions, was not responsible for the particles cholesterol-accepting properties. Apoprotein E itself was capable of cholesterol elimination from erythrocytes as well as of cholesterol esters from HDL3 and HDL2-like particles with formation of a specific complex.
