Primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia is associated with atherosclerosis and exhibits significant familial aggregation. To reveal the presence of autosomal dominant hypoalphalipoproteinemia due to a completely defective apolipoprotein A-I gene, the apolipoprotein A-I gene was analyzed in a Japanese family with low levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. An insertion of a C in the region of the seven C run between codons 3 and 5 was detected in the apolipoprotein A-I gene. The heterozygous state for the mutation was associated with approximately 50% of the normal HDL cholesterol levels and of the normal apolipoprotein A-I levels. The data suggest that a part of familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia might be an autosomal dominant trait due to a completely defective apolipoprotein A-I gene.
