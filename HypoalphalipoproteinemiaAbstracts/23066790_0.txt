The Iowa point mutation in apolipoprotein A-I (G26R) leads to a systemic amyloidosis condition, and the Milano mutation (R173C) is associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia, a reduced plasma level of high-density lipoprotein. To probe the structural effects that lead to these outcomes, we used amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with a fragment separation/mass spectrometry analysis (HX MS). The Iowa mutation inserts an arginine residue into the nonpolar face of an α-helix that spans residues 7-44 and causes changes in structure and structural dynamics. This helix unfolds, and other helices in the N-terminal helix bundle domain are destabilized. The segment encompassing residues 116-158, largely unstructured in wild-type apolipoprotein A-I, becomes helical. The helix spanning residues 81-115 is destabilized by 2 kcal/mol, increasing the small fraction of time it is transiently unfolded to ≥1%, which allows proteolysis at residue 83 in vivo over time, releasing an amyloid-forming peptide. The Milano mutation situated on the polar face of the helix spanning residues 147-178 destabilizes the helix bundle domain only moderately, but enough to allow cysteine-mediated dimerization that leads to the altered functionality of this variant. These results show how the HX MS approach can provide a powerful means of monitoring, in a nonperturbing way and at close to amino acid resolution, the structural, dynamic, and energetic consequences of biologically interesting point mutations.
