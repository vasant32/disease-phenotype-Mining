Coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for half of the 1 million deaths annually ascribed to cardiovascular disease and for almost all of the 1.5 million acute myocardial infarctions. Within families affected by early and apparently heritable CHD, dyslipidemias have a much higher prevalence than in the general population; 20%-30% of early familial CHD has been ascribed to primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia (low HDL-C). This study assesses the evidence for linkage of low HDL-C to chromosomal region 11q23 in 105 large Utah pedigrees ascertained with closely related clusters of early CHD and expanded on the basis of dyslipidemia. Linkage analysis was performed by use of 22 STRP markers in a 55-cM region of chromosome 11. Two-point analysis based on a general, dominant-phenotype model yielded LODs of 2.9 for full pedigrees and 3.5 for 167 four-generation split pedigrees. To define a localization region, model optimization was performed using the heterogeneity, multipoint LOD score (mpHLOD). This linkage defines a region on 11q23.3 that is approximately 10 cM distal to-and apparently distinct from-the ApoAI/CIII/AIV gene cluster and thus represents a putative novel localization for the low HDL-C phenotype.
