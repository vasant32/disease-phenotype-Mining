The intermediate-term effects on plasma lipoprotein lipids of substituting meat and dairy protein for carbohydrate in the diets of five subjects (three women, two men) with familial hypercholesterolemia receiving cholestyramine (mean dose, 18 g/d) were studied. Subjects were randomly allocated to either the high or low protein diets (mean 27 versus 10% of energy as protein, 25% as fat, and 48 versus 65% as carbohydrate) for 4 to 5 weeks and then switched to the other diet for another 4 to 5 weeks. Mean fasting plasma HDL cholesterol rose significantly by 17 +/- 3% (1.11 +/- 0.12 vs 0.95 +/- 0.11 mmol/L, p less than 0.005, n = 5), whereas total triglycerides fell by 23 +/- 2% (1.7 +/- 0.3 vs 2.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, p less than 0.005, n = 5), VLDL triglycerides fell by 28 +/- 5% (0.88 +/- 0.15 vs 1.18 +/- 0.19 mmol/L, p less than 0.02, n = 5), VLDL cholesterol fell by 32 +/- 7% (0.39 +/- 0.08 vs 0.56 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, p less than 0.01, n = 5), the ratio of LDL cholesterol: HDL cholesterol by 19 +/- 5% (4.7 +/- 0.7 vs 5.7 +/- 0.7, p less than 0.05) and that of total cholesterol: HDL cholesterol by 16 +/- 5% (6.6 +/- 0.5 vs 8.0 +/- 0.7, p less than 0.05) on the high versus low protein diet. Increasing dietary protein intake at the expense of carbohydrate may be useful in treating hypoalphalipoproteinemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
