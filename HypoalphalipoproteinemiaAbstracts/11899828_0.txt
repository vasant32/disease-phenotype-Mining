AIM: To investigate correlations between composition of plasmic lipid fractions in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and those with cerebrovascular insufficiency (CVI) caused by atherosclerosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients were divided into three groups; 26 patients with IHD free of CVI (group 1), 22 patients with CVI free of IHD (group 2), 27 patients with IHD and CVI (group 3). Blood lipids were measured by a standard mesiautomatic method using Technicon-AA-2 unit (USA). RESULTS: Hyperlipidemia (HLE) type II was most frequent in group 1 while HLE type IV or hypoalphalipoproteinemia without rise in cholesterol or triglycerides--in groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: In IHD without CVI dyslipidemia in most cases was associated with one of the additional risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus) while in CVI it combined with two or three additional risk factors.
