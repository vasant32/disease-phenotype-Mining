 AIM: to analyze the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and acute kidney injury (AKI) based on urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGALu) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted on the ACS patients who were admitted to the Emergency Room in Hasan Sadikin Hospital. Urinary samples were obtained at the time of the arrival and considered AKI if the urinary NGAL level 150 ng/ml. The cardiometabolic risk factors were in accord with the IDF criteria for MetS. RESULTS: there were 60 subjects that consisted of 39 men (65%) and 21 women (35%) and the average of was 58.47 (SD 9.9) years. There were 30 subjects (50%) considered AKI based on NGAL level. There were two significant CMR risk factors associated with AKI; blood pressure (hypertension) and HDL (p 0.05). HDL being the most significant cardiometabolic factor (p=0.037; OR 5.137 (95% CI 1.102-23.95)). The number of factors was also associated with the incidence of AKI; the more factors existed in a person the greater the incidence of AKI (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: blood pressure and HDL were cardiometabolic risk factors associated with AKI in ACS patients. The more cardiometabolic factors existed in a person the greater the incidence of AKI.
