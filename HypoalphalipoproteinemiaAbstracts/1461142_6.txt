We have recently reported that the apolipoprotein (apo) B-100-apo(a) complex, the protein moiety of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], has a high affinity for triglyceride(TG)-rich particles (TRP) and that this complex can affiliate with endogenous TG-rich lipoproteins. To shed more light on the apo B-100-apo(a) complex associated with plasma TRP during postprandial lipidemia, we fed five male subjects presenting with primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HP) and four male controls a single fat meal (60 g/m2) containing saturated fatty acids (SFA) and, 6 weeks later, an isocaloric meal containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The subjects were phenotyped for plasma Lp(a) and apo C-III levels, apo(a) and apo E isoforms, and lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities. Vitamin A was included in the meal as a marker of intestinally derived TRP. Following the SFA meal, three of the HP subjects showed a decrease in plasma levels of Lp(a) that lasted 10 to 12 hours in the presence of an increased hypertriglyceridemic response. Two HP subjects who had low preprandial lipoprotein lipase activity and elevated plasma apo C-III levels showed an increase in plasma Lp(a) levels along with the hypertriglyceridemic excursion. However, in all cases, inclusive of the controls, there was an elevation in plasma levels of TRP of Sf greater than 1,000 that contained apo B-100-apo(a) 6 to 8 hours after the meal. This TRP excursion appeared not to be related to the basal levels of plasma Lp(a), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, TGs, or apo(a) and apo E isoforms, and it did not coincide with the retinyl ester peak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
