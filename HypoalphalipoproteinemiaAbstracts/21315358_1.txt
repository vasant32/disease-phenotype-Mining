 OBJECTIVE: To search for an association between the non-synonymous Arg230Cys variant (R230C) of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and low HDL cholesterol levels in a Mexican, population-based nation wide survey. METHODS: The 2000 National Health Survey is a cross sectional study that included individuals from 400 cities. All individuals who had a 9-12-h fasted blood sample and a DNA sample were selected (n = 1729). These cases were randomly distributed; no bias was detected for sex, education, region or socioeconomic status. The R230C variant was genotyped using TaqMan assays. RESULTS: In individuals with the R230C/C230C genotypes (39.03 mg/dl (36.63-41.43)) lower HDL-C levels (p < 0.001) were observed compared to those with the R230R genotype (44.7 mg/dl (43.31-46.24)). The difference remained significant after adjusting for gender, body mass index and waist circumference; the mean difference in HDL cholesterol levels between alleles was 5.73 Â± 1.4 mg/dl. The magnitude of the effect was significantly greater in males. The C230 allele of ABCA1 was associated with an increased risk for hypoalphalipoproteinemia (OR 1.66 (95%CI 1.08-2.54), p < 0.05). The population attributable risk (PAR) for having hypoalphalipoproteinemia of the C230 allele of the ABCA1, after considering the confounding effect of waist circumference and gender, was 12.2% (95%CI 1.4-24.2%). CONCLUSION: The non-synonymous Arg230Cys variant of ABCA1 is associated with low levels of HDL cholesterol levels in Mexican adults. The HDL cholesterol lowering effect of the variant is greater in males. The size of the effect is greater compared to that reported for other ABCA1 variants.
