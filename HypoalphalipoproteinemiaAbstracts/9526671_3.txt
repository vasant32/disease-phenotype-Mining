VLDL chemical composition is related to plasma levels of triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. We evaluated patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia with or without hypoalphalipoproteinemia and subjects with normotriglyceridemia with hypoalphalipoproteinemia. The pattern observed in all the groups was an enrichment in the triglyceride content of VLDL and in apo B-VLDL. Compared to controls, LpC-III:B levels were higher in hypertriglyceridemic patients with low or normal HDL-cholesterol levels (7.3 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.9 +/- 1.8 and 12.3 +/- 2.8 mg/dl; P < 0.005 and P < 0.01, respectively) and LpE:B concentration was only increased in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and normal HDL-cholesterol levels (3.1 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.3 +/- 1.0 mg/dl; P < 0.01). The activity of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein was higher in hypertriglyceridemic patients with low HDL-cholesterol levels than in controls (380 +/- 25 vs. 262 +/- 14% cholesteryl esters/ml.h; P < 0.001). The most atypical VLDL particle was found in patients who combined an accumulation of VLDL particles and a reduction in HDL-cholesterol concentration. These two parameters represent both ends of the cholesteryl ester-triglyceride transfer, a crucial factor for VLDL chemical composition and HDL levels.
