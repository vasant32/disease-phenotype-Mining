OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association among insulin resistance, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD), and to test the hypothesis that HDL-C may ameliorate the adverse effects of insulin. BACKGROUND: Serum low HDL-C (hypoalphalipoproteinemia) and hyperinsulinemia are independent predictors for CHD, but a strong negative correlation exists between them, as in patients with syndrome X. METHODS: Fifty-four pairs of cases (M/F: 49/5), defined as patients with angiographically proved CHD, and control subjects (M/F: 49/5) matched with cases with regard to gender and age were included. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). RESULTS: Cases had increased HOMA insulin resistance and lower serum levels of HDL-C than controls. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that HDL-C and insulin resistance were significant discriminators of CHD (area under ROC curve: 0.72 and 0.69, respectively). The interaction between HDL-C and the association of insulin resistance with CHD was significant: subjects with hyperinsulinemia and high HDL-C had no increased risk of CHD. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that hyperinsulinemic hypoalphalipoproteinemia was a stronger indicator for CHD than either HDL-C or insulin resistance alone (-2 log likelihood: 19.0 vs. 12.6 or 15.7). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperinsulinemic hypoalphalipoproteinemia was a more potent indicator for CHD than either insulin resistance or low serum HDL-C levels alone, and the adverse effects of hyperinsulinemia seem to be ameliorated by high HDL-C levels.
