The objective of this study was to determine whether normotriglyceridemic patients with low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have concomitant defects in the metabolism of low density lipoproteins (LDLs). To address this question, measurements of turnover rates of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and LDL apolipoprotein B (apo B) were made in 36 middle-aged men with low HDL cholesterol (< 40 mg/dL), normal triglyceride (< 250 mg/dL), and normal total cholesterol (< or = 90th percentile) levels. Similar measurements were made in eight hypertriglyceridemic men having low HDL levels. For control, turnover rates of LDL apo B were measured in 24 healthy, normolipidemic men, and apo A-I kinetics were determined in 20 other healthy men with normal HDL cholesterol levels. In all patients with low HDL levels, fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) for apo A-I were increased compared with control subjects; in contrast, input rates for apo A-I in low-HDL patients were similar to control. Hypertriglyceridemic patients had significantly higher FCRs for LDL (0.463 +/- 0.040 pool/day, [mean +/- SEM]) than control subjects (0.328 +/- 0.008 pool/day, p < 0.001). In normolipidemic patients having low HDL, a bimodal pattern of LDL-apo B kinetics was observed. For 23 low-HDL patients, FCRs for LDL apo B averaged 0.450 +/- 0.017 pool/day and were significantly higher than control values. Additionally, in these patients, levels of very low density lipoprotein plus intermediate density lipoprotein (VLDL+IDL) cholesterol and VLDL+IDL apo B were higher than in control subjects (54 +/- 3 versus 32 +/- 3 mg/dL and 25 +/- 2 versus 18 +/- 1 mg/dL, respectively). The remaining 13 low-HDL patients had lower and essentially normal FCRs for LDL (0.300 +/- 0.009 pool/day); these patients also had relatively low levels of cholesterol and apo B in VLDL+IDL. Thus, two patterns of LDL kinetics were present in normotriglyceridemic patients with low HDL levels. One pattern was indistinguishable from that typically present in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, whereas the other was similar to normal control subjects. These two patterns of LDL-apo B kinetics may reflect different mechanisms for the causation of low HDL cholesterol concentrations.
