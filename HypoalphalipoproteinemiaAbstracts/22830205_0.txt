 AIM: To evaluate tocilizumab (TLZ) effects on blood lipids composition and severity of carotid arteries (CA) atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients after 24 week TLZ treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Before and 24 weeks after TLZ treatment 43 RA patients (33 women and 10 men) were examined by DAS 28 index, for blood serum concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), LPHD and LPLD cholesterol. The drug was injected intravenously in drops in a dose 8 mg/kg each 4 weeks. RESULTS: A 24 week TLZ treatment produced satisfactory and good anti-inflammatory effects in RA patients. Hypoalphalipoproteinemia incidence and atherogenicity index (AI) reduced 3 and 5 times, respectively (p < 0.05). Elevated levels of cholesterol, TG, LDPL cholesterol occurred with the same frequency before and after TLZ treatment. Cholesterol rose by 11.6%, LPHD cholesterol--by 48.9%, TG lowered by 7%, Al--by 31.9% (p < 0.05). LDLP cholesterol decreased Blood lipids composition shifts were associated with marked reduction in the disease activity: decreased concentration of C-reactive protein, IgM rheumatoid factor, DAS28 index, improvement of the patient functional status. Maximal thickness of the intima-media complex of CA increased by 8.2%. Atherosclerotic plaques were revealed before and after treatment in 17 (41.4%) patients from 41, in 5 (12.2%) patients the plaques arose after 6 months and in 5 (12.2%) patients the number of plaques increased. CONCLUSION: Because of both positive and negative effects of IL-6 receptor inhibitors on blood lipids, combined treatment of RA must include statins for correction of dyslipidemia.
