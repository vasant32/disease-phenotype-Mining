 BACKGROUND: There is a need to assess whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are more likely than noninfected individuals to have any of the specific lipoprotein combination profiles identified as the best predictors of future cardiovascular disease in the general population. METHODS: One hundred five infected patients, randomly selected from a Mexican HIV clinic, and 105 age- and gender-matched noninfected community volunteers, were enrolled to study the prevalence of each of three highly atherogenic lipoprotein phenotypes [high apolipoprotein (Apo)B/ApoA-I ratio, hypertriglyceridemia with high ApoB and hypoalphalipoproteinemia with high ApoB], and the relationship between time of exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug class and lipid changes. RESULTS: The highly atherogenic lipoprotein phenotypes were similarly frequent in both groups. There was a nonsignificant increased risk of dyslipidemia with longer exposure to any of the ART drug classes, although this hazard seems to be greater in patients with central fat accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of increased risk for certain highly atherogenic lipoprotein phenotypes in HIV-infected patients was found. More than one pathogenic mechanism for ART-associated dyslipidemia is postulated.
