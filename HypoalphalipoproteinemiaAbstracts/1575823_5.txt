Hypoalphalipoproteinemia (plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration at or below 35 mg/dl as reported in the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines) is a well known risk factor for premature coronary artery disease (CAD). In hypertriglyceridemic patients, hypoalphalipoproteinemia is commonly believed to be linked to the derangement of triglyceride metabolism. In this study the occurrence of primary hypoalphalipoproteinemia has been investigated in a cohort of hypertriglyceridemic patients whose plasma triglyceride concentration had been normalized either through diet or diet plus drug treatment. Following the initial visit, 115 hypertriglyceridemic patients received dietary advice and returned for the second visit four months later. Diet reduced plasma triglycerides in all the patients. HDL-cholesterol increased in 76 patients whereas in the others, it remained unchanged or even decreased. Plasma triglyceride concentration was normalized (less than 200 mg/dl) in 54 patients by diet alone, but among these 11 remained hypoalphalipoproteinemics. Patients in whom, despite dietary restrictions, triglycerides exceeded 200 mg/dl, were considered for pharmacological treatment with Bezafibrate (300 mg t.i.d.) for 4 months. Thirty-nine concluded the study. Treatment significantly decreased plasma triglyceride concentration in all the subjects. Normalization was achieved in 32 patients. Four of them, however, remained hypoalphalipoproteinemic. These results indicate that a subgroup of hypertriglyceridemic patients remained hypoalphalipoproteinemic even after normalization of triglyceride levels. In these patients hypertriglyceridemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia may occur as expression of two distinct primary metabolic defects.
