BACKGROUND: Hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HALP) is the most frequent lipid alteration found in patients with myocardial infarction at an early age. It is defined by amounts of lipid cholesterol at high density lipoproteins (cHDL) lower than 10% according to age and sex. The aim of this study was to know the frequency of main factors which reduce the levels of cHDL in a group of subjects with and without HALP. METHODS: Pathological antecedents, consumption of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, the presence of obesity and levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, cHDL, glucose and urea were studied in a group of 1825 males. The study was performed in the course of medical examinations for workers. RESULTS: The consumption of cigarettes, the index of body mass (IBM) and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus were higher in the group of subjects with HALP. Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides > or = 200 mg/dl) was found in 31% of the subjects with HALP vs 10% in the control group (p < 0.001); hypocholesterolemia (cholesterol < or = 150 mg/dl) was also significantly greater (9.8% vs 4.3%, p < 0.01). Altogether, in 64% of the subjects with HALP, factors which may decrease cHDL were associated. Of the factors studied, the number of triglycerides, IBM and the number of cigarettes consumed per day were the independent factors which most significantly contributed to the decrease of cHDL in the regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the subjects with hypoalphalipoproteinemia present other modifiable factors such as an elevated index of body mass, cigarette consumption and high amounts of triglicerydes, the correction of which constitutes the base for treatment of this disorder.
