Reverse correlation between content of cholesterol in lipoproteins of high density (LPHD) and severity of clinical manifestations was observed in patients with obliterating atherosclerosis of legs. Concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides and LPHD cholesterol were normal in the majority of patients but dyslipoproteinemia of various types including hypo-alpha-lipoproteinemia, was noted in some patients. The molar ratio "cholesterol/phospholipids" was increased in erythrocytes of the patients examined, demonstrating the disbalance in cholesterol turnover between the cell membranes and blood lipoproteins.
