The prevalence of lipid abnormalities revealed in a survey done in 417 Mexican cities is described. Information was obtained on 15,607 subjects, aged 20 to 69 years. In this report, only samples obtained after a 9- to 12-h fast were included (2,256 cases: 953 men and 1,303 women). The population is representative of Mexican urban adults. Mean lipid concentrations were: cholesterol, 4.80 mmol/l; triglycerides, 2.39 mmol/l; HDL cholesterol, 1.00 mmol/l; and LDL cholesterol, 3.06 mmol/l. The most prevalent abnormality was HDL cholesterol below 0.9 mmol/l (46.2% for men and 28.7% for women). Hypertriglyceridemia (>2.26 mmol/l) was the second most prevalent abnormality (24.3%). Severe hypertriglyceridemia (>11.2 mmol/l) was observed in 0.42% of the population. Increased LDL cholesterol (> or =4.21 mmol/l) was observed in 11.2% of the sample. Half of the hypertriglyceridemic subjects had a mixed dyslipidemia or low HDL cholesterol. More than 50% of the low HDL cholesterol cases were not related to hypertriglyceridemia. Insulin resistance was found in 59% of them. In conclusion, the prevalence of hypoalphalipoproteinemia and other forms of dyslipidemia in Mexican adults is very high and it is among the highest previously reported worldwide.
