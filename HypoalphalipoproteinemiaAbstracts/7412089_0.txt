The content of A1, A2, and E apolipoproteins in blood plasma of males (40-59 years of age) with normo-, hyper-, and hypoalphalipoproteinemia was determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Considerable changes were revealed in the alphalipoprotein cholesterol/A1-apo ratio which were evidence of increased capacity of HDLP for transporting cholesterol in hyperalphalipoproteinemia and a decrease in this HDLP function in hypoalphalipoproteinemia irrespective of their concentration in blood plasma. A reverse correlative connection was revealed between the A1-apo content and the E-apo content in dysalphalipoproteinemia. It is suggested that the changes in the content of A1-apo and E-apo in blood plasma are significant in lipoprotein metabolism in dysalphalipoproteinemia.
