We present the case of a 29-year-old patient with a history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Based on wireless video capsule findings he was previously diagnosed with ileal Crohn's disease at a different institution, although the clinical and radiological picture was not typical and the response to corticosteroids was poor. We performed a single-balloon enteroscopy showing a short, ulcerous stenosis 50 cm proximal from Bauhin's valve. The endoscopic and clinical histopathological findings were compatible with cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis (CMUSE). High dose corticosteroids were again started, without effect. The monoclonal tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antibody infliximab was added to the medical therapy. After induction therapy, both clinical and endoscopic amelioration was obtained. Larger case studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of TNF-α inhibition in steroid refractory CMUSE.
