The ichthyoses are a heterogeneous group of monogenetically inherited disorders of cornification, and characterized clinically by scaling or hyperkeratosis. Historically, they were classified by clinical features and inheritance patterns. As a result of the recent molecular biological revolution, the ichthyoses are now recognized as comprising many diverse entities. Importantly, identical phenotypes may be caused by mutations in multiple genes, while mutations in a single gene may result in multiple and sometimes widely divergent phenotypes. The considerable complexity of this clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders has prompted the need for a new classification. A classification that uses terminology based on a combination of the clinical and molecular genetic details, for instance loricrin keratoderma, is desirable. In this chapter we will use in principle the nosology adopted recently by an international group of experts at the First Ichthyosis Consensus Conference in Sor√®z, France.
