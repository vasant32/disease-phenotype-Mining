Loricrin is a major constituent of the epidermal cornified cell envelope. We have recently identified heterozygous loricrin gene mutations in two dominantly inherited skin diseases, the ichthyotic variant of Vohwinkel syndrome and progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma, collectively termed loricrin keratoderma. In order to see whether the mutant loricrin molecules predicted by DNA sequencing are expressed in vivo and to define their pathologic effects, we raised antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the mutated sequences of loricrin. Immunoblotting of horny cell extracts from loricrin keratoderma patients showed specific bands for mutant loricrin. Immunohistochemistry of loricrin keratoderma skin biopsies showed positive immunoreactivity to the mutant loricrin antibodies in the nuclei of differentiated epidermal keratinocytes. The immunostaining was localized to the nucleoli of the lower granular cell layer. As keratinocyte differentiation progressed the immunoreactivity moved gradually into the nucleoplasm leaving nucleoli mostly nonimmunoreactive. No substantial staining was observed along the cornified cell envelope. This study confirmed that mutant loricrin was expressed in the loricrin keratoderma skin. Mutant loricrin, as a dominant negative disrupter, is not likely to affect cornified cell envelope crosslinking directly, but seems to interfere with nuclear/nucleolar functions of differentiating keratinocytes. In addition, detection of the mutant loricrin in scraped horny layer could provide a simple noninvasive screening test for loricrin keratoderma. J Invest Dermatol 115:1088-1094 2000
