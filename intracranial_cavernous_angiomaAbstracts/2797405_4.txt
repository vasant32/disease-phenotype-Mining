Cavernous malformations located in the dura are rare. We present a case of a large cavernous malformation located in the anterior fossa and implanted in the dura of a pregnant woman. It showed great vascularization on an angiogram, and resembled a meningioma on computed tomographic scan. The operation was difficult because of the tumor's great vascularity and profuse bleeding.
