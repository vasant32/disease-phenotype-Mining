A case of neurofibromatosis complicated by a large intrasellar (pituitary) cavernous angioma is reported. Vascular abnormalities, consisting of smooth muscle cell proliferation in the intima of the intermediate and small arteries, were also observed in branches of the renal and pulmonary arteries. An association between neurofibromatosis and intracranial cavernous angioma is discussed.
