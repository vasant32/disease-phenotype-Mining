We present a case of a 15-month-old infant with intracranial cavernous angioma in the right frontal lobe in which the cerebral angiogram revealed transmedullary collecting veins characteristic of venous angioma around the lesion. This vascular malformation was histologically confirmed to be a cavernous angioma.
