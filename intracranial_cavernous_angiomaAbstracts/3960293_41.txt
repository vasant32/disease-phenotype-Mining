The histopathological, clinical, and radiological features of the intracranial cavernous angioma are reviewed, based on an analysis of 138 symptomatic, histologically verified cases. Twelve of the cases are from our own series and 126 were collected from appropriately documented reports in the modern literature. The analysis indicated that, at the time of diagnosis, one-third of the patients (49 cases) were being evaluated for seizures, one-third (40 cases) for clinical evidence of hemorrhage, and one-third (49 cases) for mass lesions. Unlike the other two groups, the group presenting with clinical evidence of hemorrhage was distinguished by a dominant age at the time of diagnosis (41% were diagnosed during the 4th decade of life), by a high incidence of prior neurological evaluation (43%), by a higher rate of diagnosis at autopsy (28%) than at operation, and by the absence of microscopic calcification within the lesion.
