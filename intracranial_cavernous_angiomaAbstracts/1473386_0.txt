18 histologically verified cases of intracranial cavernous angioma were reviewed in terms of clinical features, radiological and histopathological findings. The cases were divided into 3, groups: seizures (5), subarachnoid hemorrhage (6), and intracranial space occupied lesions (7). CT scan was done for surgical planning. Tumors were successfully removed in 17 cases except one died from edema after operation. The relations between radiological and pathologic features of intracranial cavernous angioma were discussed.
