We report 14 cases of intracranial cavernous angioma, analyzing the clinical features, with special reference to the risk of bleeding, radiological images and treatment in these and in 153 published cases, 167 in all. Cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 44%: typical (intraparenchymal or subarachnoid) in 24.6%, and masked by epilepsy, headache or neurological deficits in 19.2%. In patients with the typical hemorrhagic pattern posthemorrhagic mortality was 12.2%. Of the patients who had a hemorrhage 42.5% were left with more or less disabling neurological deficits, and 16.4% had a rebleed. In discussing treatment we consider four groups of intracranial cavernous angioma: A) symptomatic in a zone of low surgical risk; B) asymptomatic with low surgical risk; C) symptomatic with high surgical risk; D) asymptomatic with high surgical risk. The treatment is surgical, except in the high risk asymptomatic variety, best followed initially with sequential CT scan and MRI and then considered for surgery if the lesion becomes symptomatic, increases in size or presents neuroradiological signs of bleeding.
