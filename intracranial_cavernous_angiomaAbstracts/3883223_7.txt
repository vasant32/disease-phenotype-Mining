A cavernous angioma of the tentorium cerebelli, first disclosed by perinatal serial ultrasonographic studies, was extirpated totally without remarkable neurological deficit in a neonate. The tumor was accompanied by a calcified expansive hematoma in the posterior fossa. To our knowledge, this is the first case not only of cavernous angioma treated surgically and verified histologically in a neonate, but also of a calcified hematoma revealed on a conventional skull x-ray film at birth. This case suggests the possibility of hemorrhage from intracranial cavernous angioma early in life, even prenatally, and emphasizes the necessity for early diagnosis and early treatment of intracranial cavernous angiomas.
