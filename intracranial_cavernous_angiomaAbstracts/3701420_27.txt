Thirteen cases of cerebral cavernous angiomas are reported, and their radiological and pathological features are reviewed. The clinical presentation was variable: 53.8% of patients had seizures, 30.8% intracerebral hemorrhage, and 15.4% focal neurological signs, including one unusual case that presented as a cerebellopontine angle tumor. The computerized tomography (CT) scans were abnormal in all cases. Angiography was positive only when there was mass effect due to associated hematoma. Surgery was performed in 12 cases with good results. The prognosis of the 13 cases was favorable, with no mortality in this series. These data suggest that the combination of a recent seizure disorder with a hyperdense intracerebral nodule on the CT scanning should alert the neurosurgeon to the possibility of a cavernous angioma.
