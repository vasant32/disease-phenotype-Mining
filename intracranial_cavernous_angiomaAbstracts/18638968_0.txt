We report on the de novo development of intracranial cavernous angiomas. The patient is a 16-year-old boy with multiple cavernous angiomas who has experienced four episodes of intracerebral haemorrhage. Our investigations suggest that repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for routine follow-up monitoring.
