Clinical, radiological and histopathological features of eight cases of symptomatic cavernous angioma are presented. Five patients were being evaluated for seizure, two for mass lesions and one for intracranial hemorrhage. CT and/or MRI detected the lesion in all cases, but there is not a characteristic image for cavernous angioma. Good results were obtained by microsurgical approach to these malformations in seven patients with only one patient suffering a worsening of neurological status after surgery.
