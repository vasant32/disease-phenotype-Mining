<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> shares clinical features with W and Steel defects in mice, we investigated the possibility that this human disorder might result from an abnormality of the c-kit receptor or its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For these studies, full nucleotide sequences for coding regions of c-kit and SCF were generated for two Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the kds of SCF receptors on their marrow cells (31 pmol/L, 43 pmol/L) were comparable with those found in three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (50 pmol/L, 55 pmol/L, 27 pmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum SCF concentrations were 6.9 ng/mL in patient A, 14.6 ng/mL in patient B, who has been in hematologic remission since adolescence, and 2.7 ng/mL in the 3-year-old daughter of patient B, who also has Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> but is transfusion-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the SCF level in patient B increased with puberty, leading to her remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provide evidence that Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> does not result from structural abnormalities of c-kit or SCF </plain></SENT>
