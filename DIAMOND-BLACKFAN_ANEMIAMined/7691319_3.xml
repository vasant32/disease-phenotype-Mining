<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>M-07e cells detected active soluble kit-ligand from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow fibroblasts as well as from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> BMEF which produce constitutively significant amounts of SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) induced a significant increase of soluble SCF from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> BMEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF was undetectable in unstimulated cultures, while its production by bone marrow microenvironmental cells was documented for both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients after IL-1 beta stimulation in vitro </plain></SENT>
