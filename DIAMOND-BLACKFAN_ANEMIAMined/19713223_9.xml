<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether yeast models for Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> differed in the mechanism by which ribosome synthesis was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Northern blotting, pulse-chase analysis, and polysome profiling were used to study ribosome synthesis in yeast models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Localization of 60S ribosomal subunits was assessed using RPL25eGFP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls, each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease model</z:e> showed defects in 60S subunit maturation, but with distinct underlying mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the model of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 60S subunit maturation was disrupted at a relatively early stage with abortive complexes subject to rapid degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>5S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi>, unlike other large subunit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> in this model, accumulated as an extra-ribosomal species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, subunit maturation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> model was affected at a later step, giving rise to relatively stable pre-60S particles with associated 5S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> retained in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions These differences between the yeast Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> models have implications for signaling mechanisms linking abortive ribosome assembly to cell fate decisions and may contribute to the divergent clinical presentations of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
