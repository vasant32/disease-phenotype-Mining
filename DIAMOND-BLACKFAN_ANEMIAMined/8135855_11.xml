<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the inhibitory effects of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> correlated well with their abilities to oxidize ferrous ions in solution and brain homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On these grounds, it was concluded that the oxidation of Fe2+ ions inside a ferrous ion-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> complex is a major mechanism of inhibitory effects of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> on free radical processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that this mechanism is also realized during therapeutic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> of patients with "free radical" pathologies such as Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e> and Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
