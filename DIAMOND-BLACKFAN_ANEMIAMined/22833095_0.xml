<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To develop mechanistic understanding of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> pathogenesis, we studied CD34⁺ cells from peripheral blood of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients carrying RPL11 and RPS19 ribosomal gene mutations and determined their ability to undergo erythroid differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RPS19 mutations induced a decrease in proliferation of progenitor cells, but the terminal erythroid differentiation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with little or no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This phenotype was related to a G₀/G₁ cell cycle arrest associated with activation of the p53 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In marked contrast, RPL11 mutations led to a dramatic decrease in progenitor cell proliferation and a delayed erythroid differentiation with a marked increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and G₀/G₁ cell cycle arrest with activation of p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> of cord blood CD34⁺ cells with specific short hairpin (sh) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> against RPS19 or RPL11 recapitulated the two distinct phenotypes in concordance with findings from primary cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the phenotype has been reverted by shRNA p53 knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show that p53 pathway activation has an important role in pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and can be independent of the RPL11 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings shed new insights into the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
