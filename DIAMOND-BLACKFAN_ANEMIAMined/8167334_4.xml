<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In two previous studies, we observed that recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) induced an increase in marrow burst-forming unit-erythroid-derived colonies in vitro in some patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether a similar erythropoietic response could be induced in vivo, we treated 13 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> (aged 4 to 19 years) with two preparations of IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had absent absolute reticulocyte counts and markedly reduced to absent recognizable bone marrow erythroid elements; patients with circulating reticulocytes in the previous 12 months were excluded from study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except 1 had failed steroid therapy and had been transfusion-dependent since infancy; 1 patient was maintained on high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> at the time of enrollment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the first arm of the study, IL-3 (Immunex Corp, Seattle, WA) was administered subcutaneously using a dose escalation regimen of 125 to 500 micrograms/m2/day in divided dosage at 12-hour intervals, coadministered with 1.5 mg/kg/d of oral ferrous <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients that entered the trial, 4 stopped prematurely because of adverse side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other 9 evaluable cases, reticulocytes increased transiently in 1 patient from 0 to 65 x 10(9)/L after 35 days of IL-3 therapy at 250 micrograms/m2, but transfusion dependency persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One transient peak in absolute reticulocyte count was noted in 6 other patients, but no erythroid response was observed after completion of a full course of IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> at 0.5 mg/kg/d was then coadministered with IL-3 at 500 micrograms/m2 to 5 of the patients without effect, and treatment was stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients, a second preparation of IL-3 (Sandoz Canada Inc, Dorval, Quebec, Canada) was initiated in a dose escalation regimen of 2.5 to 10 micrograms/kg and was coadministered with ferrous <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No erythroid response was observed in either patient, and in one of the two, alternate-day subcutaneous recombinant erythropoietin at 300 U/kg was administered for 3 weeks in combination with daily IL-3 at 10 micrograms/kg, but no increased erythropoiesis was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significant increases in white blood cell and eosinophil counts during administration of both preparations of IL-3 were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data show that the response of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients to IL-3 in vivo is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and cannot be predicted from in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The absence of a corrective effect of IL-3 in these patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> indicates that a deficiency of the cytokine is not central in the pathogenesis of the disorder </plain></SENT>
