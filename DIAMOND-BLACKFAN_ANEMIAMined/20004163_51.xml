<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic ribosomes possess more ribosomal proteins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> than do <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> ribosomes, which are implicated in extraribosomal functions in the eukaryotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By combining cryo-EM with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein homology modeling, we obtained an atomic model of the yeast 80S ribosome complete with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> expansion segments and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ribosomal proteins for which a structural homolog can be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation or deletion of 80S ribosomal proteins can abrogate maturation of the ribosome, leading to several human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have localized one such protein unique to eukaryotes, rpS19e, whose mutations are associated with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we characterize crucial interactions between the dynamic stalk base of the ribosome with eukaryotic elongation factor 2 </plain></SENT>
