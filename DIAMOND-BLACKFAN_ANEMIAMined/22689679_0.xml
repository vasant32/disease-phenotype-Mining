<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because most mutations are loss of function and detected by direct sequencing of coding exons, we reasoned that part of the approximately 50% mutation negative patients may have carried a copy number variant of ribosomal protein genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a proof of concept, we designed a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay targeted to screen the six genes that are most frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients: RPS17, RPS19, RPS26, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this assay we showed that deletions represent approximately 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of these six genes allows the genetic characterization of approximately 65% of patients, showing that Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is indisputably a ribosomopathy </plain></SENT>
