<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the RPS19 gene have been identified in 25% of individuals affected by Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e> characterized by an aregenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and a variety of malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 60 mutations in the five coding exons of RPS19 have been described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a mutation (c.-1 + 26G&gt;T) and an insertion at -631 upstream of ATG (c.-147_-146insGCCA) in the noncoding region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> phenotype is extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> from silent to severe and because haploinsufficiency seems to play a role in this process, it is likely that genetic variations in the noncoding regions affecting translation of RPS19 can modulate the phenotypic expression of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, to date, very few studies have addressed this question comprehensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed detailed sequence analysis of the RPS19 gene in 239 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and 110 of their relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that 6.2% of the patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> carried allelic variations upstream of ATG: 3.3% with c.-1 + 26G&gt;T; 2.5% with c.-147_-146insGCCA; and 0.4% with c.-174G&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the c.-147_-146insGCCA, which has been found in a black American and French Caribbean control population, was not found in 500 Caucasian control chromosomes we studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it was found in association with the same haplotype distribution of four intronic polymorphisms in our patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although a polymorphism, the frequency of this variant in the patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and its association with the same haplotype raises the possibility that this polymorphism and the other genetic variations in the noncoding region could play a role in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
