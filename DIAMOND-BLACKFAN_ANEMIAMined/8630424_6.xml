<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The origin of the imperfect erythrogenesis is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The existence of more than one molecular basis for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is indicated by its different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>modes of inheritance</z:hpo> and widely variable clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several erythroid growth factors have been thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is neither molecular nor clinical evidence for the involvement of stem cell factor or interleukin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observation of elevated erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations and an impaired in vivo and in vitro response to pharmacologic doses of recombinant human EPO has suggested a defective EPO function in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the possible involvement of the EPO receptor (EPO-R) gene in 23 patients by screening its coding sequence for mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A Southern blot and hybridization with an EPO-R probe was also performed on DNA from seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No causal mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of concordant segregation of the disease with the EPO-R gene in two informative families ruled out its role in their <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is not commonly associated with EPO-R gene mutations </plain></SENT>
