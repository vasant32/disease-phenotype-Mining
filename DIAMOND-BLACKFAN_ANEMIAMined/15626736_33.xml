<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study effects of RPS19 deficiency in hematopoiesis we transduced CD34(+) umbilical cord blood (CB) and bone marrow (BM) cells with 3 lentiviral vectors expressing small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) against RPS19 and 1 scrambled control vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> vectors also express green fluorescent protein (GFP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transduction with the siRNA vectors reduced RPS19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels to various degrees, which resulted in erythroid defects, correlating to the degree of RPS19 down-regulation, and was rescued by expression of an siRNA-resistant RPS19 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colony formation capacity conjointly decreased with RPS19 levels in CD34(+) CB and BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In liquid culture supporting erythroid differentiation, RPS19-silenced as well as <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patient CD34(+) cells exhibited reduced proliferative capacity and impaired erythroid differentiation resulting in fewer erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-Es) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When assaying myeloid development, a less pronounced influence on proliferation was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows for the first time that RPS19 silencing decreases the proliferative capacity of hematopoietic progenitors and leads to a defect in erythroid development </plain></SENT>
