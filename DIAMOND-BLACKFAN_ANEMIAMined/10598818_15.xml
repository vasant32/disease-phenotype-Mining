<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) S19 were found in a subset of patients with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize further RPS19 mutations and to investigate genotype-phenotype relationships, we screened this gene for mutations in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> by direct sequencing and Southern-blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four novel mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A G120A nonsense mutation resulting in a stop at codon 33, a C302T nonsense mutation introducing a premature stop at codon 84, and a 327delG which results in a frame shift at codon 103 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fourth and more complex mutation (TT157-158AA, 160insCT) resulting in a Leu45Gln and a frame shift from codon 47 was found in three affected family members with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotypes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The different clinical expression for identical mutations suggest the presence of other modulating factors for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutations presented here further support the role of RPS19 in erythropoietic differentiation and proliferation </plain></SENT>
