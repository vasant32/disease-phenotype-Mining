<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is a 16-kDa protein found mainly as a component of the ribosomal 40 S subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its mutations are responsible for Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of RPS19 has therefore been implicated in this <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>defective erythropoiesis</z:hpo>, although the link between them is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two not mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed: altered protein synthesis and loss of unknown functions not directly connected with the structural role of RPS19 in the ribosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A role in rRNA processing has been surmised for the yeast ortholog, whereas the extracellular RPS19 dimer has a monocyte chemotactic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three proteins are known to interact with RPS19: FGF2, complement component 5 receptor 1, and a nucleolar protein called RPS19-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have used a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify a fourth protein: the serine-threonine kinase PIM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study describes our use of proteomics strategies to look for proteins interacting with RPS19 to determine its functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proteins were isolated by affinity purification with a GST-RPS19 recombinant protein and identified using LCMS/MS analysis coupled to bioinformatics tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified 159 proteins from the following Gene Ontology categories: NTPases (ATPases and GTPases; five proteins), hydrolases/helicases (19 proteins), isomerases (two proteins), kinases (three proteins), splicing factors (five proteins), structural constituents of ribosome (29 proteins), transcription factors (11 proteins), transferases (five proteins), transporters (nine proteins), DNA/<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein species (53 proteins), other (one dehydrogenase protein, one ligase protein, one peptidase protein, one receptor protein, and one translation elongation factor), and 13 proteins of still unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proteomics results were validated by affinity purification and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These interactions were further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal RPS19 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many interactors are nucleolar proteins and thus are expected to take part in the RPS19 interactome; however, some proteins suggest additional functional roles for RPS19 </plain></SENT>
