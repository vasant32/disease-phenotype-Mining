<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an erythropoietin-containing assay system, specimens from six of the eight patients yielded low numbers of erythroid colonies compared to control values, and in five of these no erythropoietin dose-response could be elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Addition of IL-3, GM-CSF or both to cultures from the six patients had no effect on CFU-E-derived colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-3 but not GM-CSF induced a marked increase in the number (183%) and size of the BFU-E-derived colonies in five of the six cases and partially corrected the impaired dose-response to erythropoietin in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow from the other two patients yielded numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E colonies comparable to controls and manifested similar increments in colonies with increasing concentrations of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When IL-3 was added to these cultures, further increments were observed in the number and size of BFU-E colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that IL-3 enhanced the marrow erythropoiesis in most of the patients and exerted a corrective effect on the aberrant colony formation in the presence of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data raise the possibility of IL-3 as a therapeutic agent in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
