<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ribosome is an evolutionarily conserved organelle essential for cellular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ribosome construction requires assembly of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four different species of rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As RPs co-assemble into one multi-subunit complex, mutation of the genes that encode RPs might be expected to give rise to phenocopies, in which the same phenotype is associated with loss-of-function of each individual gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a more complex picture is emerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report the first two mouse mutations (Rps7(Mtu) and Rps7(Zma)) of ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7), a gene that has been implicated in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rps7 disruption results in <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>decreased body size</z:mp>, abnormal skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, mid-ventral <z:mp ids='MP_0002938'>white spotting</z:mp>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002092'>eye malformations</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, as demonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by Trp53 deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Rps7 mutants have additional overt malformations of the developing central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes that are not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Rps7 mouse mutants show no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001188'>hyperpigmentation</z:mp>, phenotypes associated with mutation of human RPS7 and other murine RPs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We provide two novel RP mouse models and expand the repertoire of potential phenotypes that should be examined in RP mutants to further explore the concept of RP gene-specific phenotypes </plain></SENT>
