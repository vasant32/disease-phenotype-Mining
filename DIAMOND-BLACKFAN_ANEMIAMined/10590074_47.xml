<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) gene were recently identified in 10 patients with Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence of mutations in this gene in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and to begin to define the molecular basis for the observed variable clinical phenotype of this disorder, the genomic sequence of the 6 exons and the 5' untranslated region of the RPS19 gene was directly assessed in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> index cases from 172 new families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations affecting the coding sequence of RPS19 or splice sites were found in 34 cases (19.7%), whereas mutations in noncoding regions were found in 8 patients (4.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations included nonsense, missense, splice sites, and frameshift mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hot spot for missense mutations was identified between codons 52 and 62 of the RPS19 gene in a new sequence consensus motif W-[YFW]-[YF]-x-R-[AT]-A-[SA]-x-[AL]-R-[HRK]-[ILV]-Y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the nature of mutations and the different patterns of clinical expression, including age at presentation, presence of malformations, and therapeutic outcome, could be documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, RPS19 mutations were also found in some first-degree relatives presenting only with isolated high erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase activity and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of a consistent relationship between the nature of the mutations and the clinical phenotype implies that yet unidentified factors modulate the phenotypic expression of the primary genetic defect in families with RPS19 mutations </plain></SENT>
