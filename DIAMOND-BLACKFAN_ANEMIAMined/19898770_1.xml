<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the interacting partners with RPS19 is the oncoprotein PIM-1 kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We intercrossed Rps19 ( +/- ) and Pim-1 ( -/- ) mice strains to study the effect from the disruption of both genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The double mutant (Rps19 ( +/- ) Pim-1 ( -/- )) mice display <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth with increased peripheral white and red blood cell counts when compared to the w.t. mice (Rps19 ( +/+ ) Pim-1 ( +/+ )) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of bone marrow cells in Rps19 ( +/- ) Pim-1 ( -/- ) mice revealed up-regulated levels of c-Myc and the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl(2), Bcl(XL), and Mcl-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is associated with a reduction of the apoptotic factors Bak and Caspase 3 as well as the cell cycle regulator p21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that combined Rps19 insufficiency and Pim-1 deficiency promote murine myeloid cell growth through a deregulation of c-Myc and a simultaneous up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl proteins </plain></SENT>
