<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Deletions of chromosome 19 have rarely been reported, with the exception of some patients with deletion 19q13.2 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BDS">Blackfan-Diamond syndrome</z:e> due to haploinsufficiency of the RPS19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such a paucity of patients might be due to the difficulty in detecting a small rearrangement on this chromosome that lacks a distinct banding pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Array comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) has become a powerful tool for the detection of microdeletions and microduplications at high resolution in patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using array CGH, this study identified three interstitial overlapping 19q13.11 deletions, defining a minimal critical region of 2.87 Mb, associated with a clinically recognisable syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three patients share several major features including: pre- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo> with slender habitus, severe postnatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000047'>hypospadias</z:hpo>, signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000968'>ectodermal dysplasia</z:hpo>, and cutis <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> over the posterior occiput </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these clinical features have also been described in a previously reported patient with a 19q12q13.1 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No recurrent breakpoints were identified in our patients, suggesting that no-allelic homologous recombination mechanism is not involved in these rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, the authors suggest that this chromosomal abnormality may represent a novel clinically recognisable microdeletion syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of dosage sensitive genes in the 19q13.11 region </plain></SENT>
