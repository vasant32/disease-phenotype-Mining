<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is a rare congenital pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> characterized by normochromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo>, and normocellular bone marrow with a selective deficiency of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), currently the only gene associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, is mutated in 25% of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, but its role in erythropoiesis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We attempted to elucidate the importance of RPS19 in translation in relation to the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured translation and proliferation rates in unstimulated and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes isolated from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, as well as in K562 cells expressing several RPS19 mutants to directly test the effect of RPS19 mutations on translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of leucine on overall translation was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the level of translation was on average 48-73% of controls in both unstimulated and PHA-activated <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> lymphocytes irrespective of mutations in RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of leucine increased the translational level in RPS19-non-mutated <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cells, but not in cells with an RPS19 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In unstimulated <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cells, proliferation was significantly impaired in both RPS19-mutated and non-mutated cells, but in both groups could be efficiently activated by PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Studies on K562 cells showed that RPS19 mutations affecting RPS19 conserved arginines R56Q and R62Q could significantly inhibit the rate of protein synthesis, indicating the importance of RPS19 in translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that inefficient translation may be the main cause of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, and administration of leucine may be beneficial for at least some <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
