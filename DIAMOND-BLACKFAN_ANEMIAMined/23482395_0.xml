<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e>, mutations in ribosomal protein genes often interfere with the processing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), the mechanism of which remains elusive in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using loss-of-function experiments and extensive <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> analysis, we have defined the precise position of the endonucleolytic cleavage E in the ITS1, which generates the 18S-E intermediate, the last precursor to the 18S rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, this cleavage is followed by 3'-5' exonucleolytic trimming of the 18S-E precursor during nuclear export of the pre-40S particle, which sets a new mechanism for 18S rRNA formation clearly different from that established in yeast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, cleavage at site E is also followed by 5'-3' exonucleolytic trimming of the ITS1 by exonuclease XRN2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perturbation of this step on knockdown of the large subunit ribosomal protein RPL26, which was recently associated to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, reveals the putative role of a highly conserved cis-acting sequence in ITS1 processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data cast new light on the original mechanism of ITS1 elimination in human cells and provide a mechanistic framework to further study the interplay of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>-linked ribosomal proteins in this process </plain></SENT>
