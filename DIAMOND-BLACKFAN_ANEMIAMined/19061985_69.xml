<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is the most prominent feature of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, the disease is also characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and congenital anomalies that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease has been associated with mutations in four ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A, in about 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic basis of the remaining 70% of cases is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the second known mutation in RPS17 and probable pathogenic mutations in three more RP genes, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified rare variants of unknown significance in three other genes, RPL36, RPS15, and RPS27A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, careful review of the clinical data showed that mutations in RPL5 are associated with multiple physical abnormalities, including craniofacial, thumb, and heart anomalies, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominantly present in patients carrying mutations in RPL11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that mutations of RPL5, RPL11, or RPS7 in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cells is associated with diverse defects in the maturation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNAs</z:chebi> in the large or the small ribosomal subunit production pathway, expanding the repertoire of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> processing defects associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
