<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the transplantation outcomes of 61 DBA patients whose data were reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry between 1984 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 7 years (range, 1-32 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 55 patients with available transfusion information, 35 (64%) had received &gt; or =20 units of blood before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (67%) received their bone marrow grafts from an HLA-matched related donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to neutrophil recovery was 17 days (range, 10-119 days) and to platelet recovery was 23 days (range, 9-119 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients did not achieve neutrophil engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 100-day mortality was 18% (95% confidence interval, 10%-29%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-year probability of overall survival was 64% (range, 50%-74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In univariate analysis, a Karnofsky score &gt; or =90 and transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor were associated with better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is effective for the treatment of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transplantation before deterioration of the performance status and from an HLA-identical sibling donor may improve survival </plain></SENT>
