<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is a fatal congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> characterized by a specific disruption in erythroid progenitor cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of patients have mutations in the ribosomal protein RPS19 suggesting that Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> may be caused by a defect in ribosome biogenesis and translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear how these defects specifically disrupt early erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that the retroviral receptor/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> exporter FLVCR1 is critical for early erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLVCR1 null mice, despite dying in utero and having reduced myeloid and lymphoid cell growth, show a disruption in early erythropoiesis and have craniofacial and limb deformities similar to those found in some Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we recapitulated the Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> hematologic features of reduced erythropoiesis but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> myelopoiesis by disrupting FLVCR1 in human hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that CD71(high) cells, which are enriched for immature erythroid cells, from Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients negative for RPS19 gene mutations express alternatively spliced isoforms of FLVCR1 transcript which encode proteins whose expression and function are disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More importantly, our results suggest alternative splicing of FLVCR1 is significantly enhanced in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> immature erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we also observed enhanced FLVCR1 alternative splicing and a dramatic reduction of FLVCR1 protein expression in RPS19 down-regulated human K562 cells, which were used as a model to represent RPS19 gene mutated Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest enhanced alternative splicing of FLVCR1 transcripts and subsequent FLVCR1 insufficiency as an additional contributing factor to the erythropoietic defect observed in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
