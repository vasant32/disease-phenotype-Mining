<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RPS19 has been identified as the first gene associated with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> that includes variable physical malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is mutated in approximately 25% of the patients although doubts remain as to whether <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> clinical phenotype depends on the ribosomal function of RPS19 or on an extra-ribosomal role or on both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RPS19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> with mutations that introduce premature stop codons or eliminate it are rapidly turned over by the surveillance mechanisms possibly causing a decrease in the RPS19 protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease in RPS19 level has been shown to cause a defect in the maturation of 18S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less clear is the effect of missense mutations in RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the aim of analyzing the functional features of mutated RPS19, we prepared cDNA constructs expressing RPS19 containing 11 missense mutations and a trinucleotide insertion found in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After transfection, we analyzed the following properties of the mutated proteins: (i) protein stability, (ii) subcellular localization and (iii) assembly into ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that some RPS19 mutations alter the capacity of the protein to localize in nucleolar structure and these mutated RPS19 are very unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, none of the mutated RPS19 analyzed in this study, including those proteins that appear localized into the nucleolus, is able to be assembled into mature ribosome </plain></SENT>
