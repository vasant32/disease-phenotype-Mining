<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ribosomal protein S19 gene (RPS19) is one of the causative genes for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>; however, the pathologic mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e> and abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the pathophysiology of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, the gene expression profile of 2 representative patients carrying no RPS19 mutations was compared with that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients, assessed by the microarray analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The K-mean clustering analysis revealed the significant categorization of 28 ribosomal protein (RP) genes into a small set of group (994 genes) (P=2.39E-17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were expressed at lower levels in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> than in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RPS19 was categorized into the set of low expressing genes in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mutations were determined in the promoter and coding sequences of top 10 RP genes expressed at the levels over 1.2 of the AA/<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> ratio, in 3 DBA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the lower expression of RP gene group, even without the mutation, was a distinctive feature of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> from AA, although the study number was small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reduced RP gene expression, by itself, may suggest an underlying mechanism of the constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
