<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (age range 7-27) performed cycle ergometry with a progressively increasing work rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gas exchange was measured breath-by-breath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests were done before and after routine transfusion (mean increase in hematocrit 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to 10 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children who performed the same protocol on two occasions separated by a 2-day interval, and to the results of 109 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children studied in this laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfusion resulted in: a small, but significant increase in the anaerobic threshold (9%) and an increase in the slope of the relationship between O2-uptake and heart rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite these improvements, the majority of the patients had abnormally low values of maximal O2 uptake, anaerobic threshold, and slope of the O2 uptake-heart rate relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were more marked in the older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of gas exchange during exercise may be helpful in determining an optimal hematocrit for patients on hypertransfusion regimens </plain></SENT>
