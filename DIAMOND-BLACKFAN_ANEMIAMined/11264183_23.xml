<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis has shown that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> in many of both dominant and recessive <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families mapped to chromosome 19q13.2 leading to the cloning of a gene on chromosome 19q13.2 that encodes a ribosomal protein, RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, subsequently, mutations of the RPS19 gene have only been identified in 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed 14 multiplex <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families, 9 of which had 19q13.2 haplotypes inconsistent with 19q linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A genome-wide search for linked loci suggested the presence of a second <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> locus in a 26.4-centimorgan (cM) interval on human chromosome 8p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, 24 additional <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families were ascertained and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 38 families were analyzed with additional polymorphic markers on chromosome 8p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 18 of 38 families were consistent with linkage to chromosome 8p with a maximal LOD score with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of 3.55 at D8S277 assuming 90% penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate the existence of a second <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> gene in the 26.4-cM telomeric region of human chromosome 8p23.3-p22, most likely within an 8.1-cM interval flanked by D8S518 and D8S1825 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven families were inconsistent with linkage to 8p or 19q and did not reveal mutations in the RPS19 gene, suggesting further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
