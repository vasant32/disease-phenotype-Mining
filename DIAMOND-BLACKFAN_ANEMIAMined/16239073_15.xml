<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 25% of Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> cases are associated with mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis presented here ties together molecular and clinical features of the disease, and establishes a conceptual framework for understanding many of the unusual characteristics of a growing number of diseases linked to factors involved in ribosome synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis states that ribosomal proteins are expressed in amounts that differ relative to one another in a tissue-specific manner, and that haploinsufficiency for a particular protein may make that protein limiting for ribosome assembly in some tissues, while other tissues remain unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further, polymorphisms in factors controlling the expression of a particular ribosomal protein gene may alter its expression and expand or contract the number of tissues affected from individual to individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Support for the hypothesis comes from the observation that promoters in ribosomal protein genes exhibit little conservation and transcription profiling indicates that the absolute amounts of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for individual ribosomal proteins can vary dramatically relative to one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Balanced expression of ribosomal proteins is achieved post-translationally, where excess proteins not assembled into ribosomal subunits are often rapidly degraded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of ribosomes per cell is therefore determined by the factors that limit assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In principle, any essential ribosomal protein could become limiting for assembly if its level of expression <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> below a critical threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether an inactivating mutation in ribosomal protein gene would affect protein synthetic capacity of a tissue would depend on the ratio of the ribosomal protein relative to other ribosomal proteins in that tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If the ratio were high, the tissue may not be affected as the level of functional protein may not fall to a point where it becomes limiting for subunit assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, if the ratio were low, an inactivating mutation could make the protein limiting for subunit assembly resulting in a clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms in the myriad of cis- and trans-acting factors, which govern the expression of ribosomal proteins in response to developmental and physiological signals, could act to increase or decrease ribosomal protein expression and thereby impact the profile and severity of clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these factors represent targets for the development of new therapies to treat Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and other ribosome based diseases </plain></SENT>
