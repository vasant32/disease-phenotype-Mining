<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is one of the 79 ribosomal proteins (RPs) in vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous mutations in RPS19 have been identified in 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), but the relationship between RPS19 mutations and the pure red-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed an RPS19-deficient zebrafish by knocking down rps19 using a Morpholino antisense oligo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RPS19-deficient animals showed a dramatic decrease in blood cells as well as deformities in the head and tail regions at early developmental stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes were rescued by injection of zebrafish rps19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, but not by injection of rps19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> with mutations that have been identified in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that rps19 is essential for hematopoietic differentiation during early embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effects were specific to rps19, but knocking down the genes for three other RPs, rpl35, rpl35a and rplp2, produced similar phenotypes, suggesting that these genes might have a common function in zebrafish erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RPS19-deficient zebrafish will provide a valuable tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> development in humans </plain></SENT>
