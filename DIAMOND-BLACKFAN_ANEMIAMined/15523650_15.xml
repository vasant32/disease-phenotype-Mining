<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP)S19 gene have been found in about 25% of the cases of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> that includes variable physical malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various mutations have been identified in the RPS19 gene, but no investigations regarding the effect of these alterations on RPS19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels have been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is well established that mutated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> containing a premature stop codon (PTC) or lacking a stop codon can be rapidly degraded by specific mechanisms called nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and nonstop decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the involvement of such mechanisms in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, we analyzed immortalized lymphoblastoid cells and primary fibroblasts from patients presenting different kinds of mutations in the RPS19 gene, generating allelic deletion, missense, nonsense, and nonstop messengers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that RPS19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels are decreased in the cells with allelic deletion and, to a variable extent, also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cell lines with PTC or nonstop mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis showed that translation inhibition causes a stabilization of the mutated RPS19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that NMD and nonstop decay affect the expression of mutated RPS19 genes; this may help to clarify genotype-phenotype correlations in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
