<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using siRNAs, we show that knockdown of 31 of the 32 ribosomal proteins of the human 40S subunit (ribosomal protein of the small subunit [RPS]) strongly affects pre-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> (rRNA) processing, which often correlates with nucleolar chromatin disorganization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>16 RPSs are strictly required for initiating processing of the sequences flanking the 18S rRNA in the pre-rRNA except at the metazoan-specific early cleavage site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 16 proteins are necessary for progression of the nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation steps and for nuclear export </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distribution of these two subsets of RPSs in the 40S subunit structure argues for a tight dependence of pre-rRNA processing initiation on the folding of both the body and the head of the forming subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the functional dichotomy of RPS proteins reported in this study is correlated with the mutation frequency of RPS genes in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
