<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have modeled <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in zebrafish using antisense morpholinos to rps19 and rps14, respectively, and have demonstrated that, as in humans, haploinsufficient levels of these proteins lead to a profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the hypothesis that RP loss results in impaired <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> translation, we treated Rps19 and Rps14-deficient embryos with the amino acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi>, a known activator of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a striking improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> associated with RP loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We confirmed our findings in primary human CD34‚Å∫ cells, after shRNA knockdown of RPS19 and RPS14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed that loss of Rps19 or Rps14 activates the mTOR pathway, and this is accentuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> in both Rps19 and Rps14 morphants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This effect could be abrogated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> suggesting that mTOR signaling may be responsible for the improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies support the rationale for ongoing clinical trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> as a therapeutic agent for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, and potentially for patients with del(5q) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
