<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which RPS19 mediates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> are still unclear, as well as the regulation of RPS19 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show herein that RPS19 binds specifically to the 5' untranslated region of its own <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with an equilibrium binding constant (K(D)) of 4.1+/-1.9 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> binding properties of two mutant RPS19 proteins (W52R and R62W) identified in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a significant increase in K(D) for both proteins (16.1+/-2.1 and 14.5+/-4.9 nM, respectively), indicating a reduced <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding capability (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the binding of RPS19 to its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> has a regulatory function and hypothesize that the weaker <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> binding of mutant rRPS19 may have implications for the pathophysiological mechanisms in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
