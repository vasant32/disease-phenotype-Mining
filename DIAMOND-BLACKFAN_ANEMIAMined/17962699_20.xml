<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not known how the RPS19 deficiency impairs erythropoiesis and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate molecular mechanisms in RPS19-deficient <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, we analyzed the effects of RPS19 deficiency on erythropoietin (EPO)-induced signal transduction, cell cycle, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in RPS19-deficient TF-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We did not find any abnormality in EPO-induced signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, RPS19-deficient TF-1 cells showed G0/G1 arrest (82% vs. 58%; p &lt; .05) together with accumulation of p21 and p27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fraction of apoptotic cells detected by Annexin V analysis also increased compared with control cells (13% vs. 3.1%; p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins showed that the level of bcl-2 and Bad was decreased and Bax was increased in RPS19-deficient TF-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, primary CD34-positive cells from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients detected by Annexin V analysis also generated a higher number of apoptotic cells compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34-positive cells during in vitro culture (38% vs. 8.9%; n = 5; p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that although RPS19 silencing reduces EPO-induced development of erythroid progenitors expressing glycophorin A (GPA), RPS19 silencing in cells already expressing GPA does not affect GPA expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that RPS19 deficiency causes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and accelerated loss of erythroid progenitors in RPS19-deficient <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
