<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients have a variety of clinical characteristics, and the role of the RPS19 gene in the pathogenesis of the disease is presently unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate a possible role for RPS19 in erythropoiesis, we looked for proteins associated with mouse RPS19 using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified a novel protein, which we named S19 binding protein (S19BP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deduced amino acid sequence of S19BP derived from cDNA defines a calculated mass of 15,849 and an isoelectric point of 11.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No known functional motifs were found in S19BP except a short <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53411">polylysine</z:chebi> tract embedded in a putative nucleolar localization signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunolocalization experiments revealed that S19BP was highly concentrated in nucleoli after 6 h of transfection in Cos-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>S19BP was expressed ubiquitously at a basal level but a significantly high level of expression was observed in some tissues </plain></SENT>
