<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To define further the natural history of treated Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> characterized by a paucity of erythroid precursors, we analyzed 76 patients diagnosed or followed at Children's Hospital, Boston, between 1931 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is generally defined as macrocytic, we found that mean corpuscular volume in infants aged &lt;5 months rarely exceeded the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and is of little diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>Macrocytosis</z:mp> in patients aged &gt; or = 5 months was more striking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine of 16 patients who never received steroids experienced remissions, sometimes after years of transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of 56 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 31, 13 experienced remissions, 11 remained steroid dependent and 7 later required transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most nonresponders maintained transfusion dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients frequently (64%) experienced treatment-related morbidity, most commonly <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was profoundly elevated (RR, 200; 95% CI, 54.5-512.1) and hematologic parameters at long-term follow-up were often abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While potential responsiveness to steroids and relative ease of red cell transfusion make <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> one of the most treatable congenital marrow failure syndromes, both disease-related and treatment-related factors contributed to a limited prognosis (median survival, 38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients should be carefully monitored longitudinally for evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and adverse effects of therapy, and alternative treatment strategies should be considered on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
