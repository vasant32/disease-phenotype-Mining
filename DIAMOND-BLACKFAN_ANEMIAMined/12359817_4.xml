<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> is commonly used, but with limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trials with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> (CSA) are not frequently reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study we analyzed our results in the management of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> by different medical treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The results of 22 patients diagnosed at our Hematology Center in the New Cairo University Children's Hospital during the period 1991-2001 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patients first received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg/d) for different courses according to their response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the year 2000, the steroid nonresponders received CSA (3-12 mg/kg/d) for 6 months unless treatment complications developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease ranged from 1 to 24 months (median: 2.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean values of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, the reticulocyte count, and the myeloid/erythroid ratio at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease were 4.75 +/- 1.79 g/dL, 0.14 +/- 0.16, and 39.4 +/- 27.08, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> from 0.25 to 10 years (median: 2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were nonresponders (45.5%), and 5 patients (22.7%) responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of 5 responders are off treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of &gt;9 g/dL, and 3 of 5 are currently <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of 10 patients not responding to steroids, 8 received CSA for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Four patients (50%) responded to CSA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A significant positive association was found between CSA dose and response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CSA therapy should be tried in steroid-resistant Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients before blood transfusion or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy complications are instituted </plain></SENT>
