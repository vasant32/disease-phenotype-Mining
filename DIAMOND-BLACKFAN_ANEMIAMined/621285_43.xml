<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CHA) or the Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, erythropoietin responsive committed erythroid precursors were enumerated by the plasma clot method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These included blood and marrow erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) and marrow erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood nucleated cells of 11 patients and the marrow cells of seven of these patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies were repeated in several patients during relapse and after induction of remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BFU-E were undetectable in the marrow and blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one relapsed patient, and the numbers of marrow CFU-E were depressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relapsed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood BFU-E remained low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence was obtained for suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-E or BFU-E by CHA lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin dose-response curves performed in two patients revealed a 10-fold increase in erythropoietin requirement for marrow CFU-E colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This marked unresponsiveness to erythropoietin was strikingly improved by steroid therapy in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CHA is the result of a qualitative and/or quantitative deficiency of BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If BFU-E are produced, they must be relatively unresponsive to erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The abnormal BFU-E give rise to erythropoietin unresponsive CFU-E and, thence, to proerythroblasts that are, in turn, trapped in that early stage of development because of their poor erythropoietic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence, red cell production is deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Steroids appear to improve the erythropoietin response of CHA erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
