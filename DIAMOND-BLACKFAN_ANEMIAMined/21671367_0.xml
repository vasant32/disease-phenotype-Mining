<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported decreased neutrophil chemotaxis in patients with <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>; there are no reports of neutrophil function in other IBMFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined neutrophil respiratory burst function in IBMFS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Samples from 43 IBMFS patients and 61 healthy family members were collected, shipped, and analyzed within 24â€‰hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied samples from 12 healthy control persons immediately after collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils were stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> 12-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) and N-formyl-methyonyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32630">leucyl</z:chebi>-phenylalanine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>), and respiratory burst analyzed by reduction of dihydro-rhodamine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>-driven respiratory burst activity between each of the IBMFS subgroups and their respective family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference in respiratory burst activity between any IBMFS, pooled group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> healthy family members and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil respiratory burst activity from IBMFS patients does not differ from that of healthy family members and controls </plain></SENT>
