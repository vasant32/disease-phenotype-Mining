<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It previously has been reported that red blood cells (RBC) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BDS">Diamond-Blackfan syndrome</z:e> (DBS) have increased activity of orotidine decarboxylase (<z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies reported here compared the activity of these two enzymes in DBS erythrocytes, cord blood, and reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp>, although increased in some DBS erythrocytes, was not significantly different from that seen in cord RBC or reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, RBC-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was increased in 23 of 26 DBS patients; and this enzyme elevation was distinct from that seen in cord blood and reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 26 of 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005510'>transient erythroblastopenia</z:hpo> of childhood (TEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate RBC-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity is more sensitive than <z:mp ids='MP_0010716'>ODC</z:mp> as a marker of DBS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, RBC-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi> activity continues to be useful for distinguishing DBS and TEC in most patients with RBC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
