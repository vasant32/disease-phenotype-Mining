<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IMFS patients are at risk for severe cytopenias, development of marrow cytogenetic abnormalities (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of disease progression and proportion of patients at risk for these complications is currently unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined recently diagnosed IMFS patients to determine distribution of diagnoses, disease progression and development of significant outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The CIMFR is a prospective multi-center study established in 2001 to register <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> IMFS patients in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was restricted to patients diagnosed after November 30, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Summary statistics were used to depict the study population while survival was described using the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 74 CIMFR patients were considered recently diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age at diagnosis was 2.7 years (range, birth to 40.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Annual follow-up data were available for 53 (72%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The five most prevalent diagnoses were Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>), Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DKC), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kostmann</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (KS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (24%) patients were unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight (53%) follow-up patients had disease progression as indicated by new or worsening cytopenias, new marrow changes, or initiation of transfusion support and/or medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (19%) fulfilled minimal diagnostic criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by first follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five patients have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Survival at 36 months is 89.8 +/- 5.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IMFS patients are often diagnosed at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The relative distribution of diagnoses is similar to previous reviews of published cases; however, 25% of patients are currently unclassifiable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Disease progression has occurred in approximately 50% of follow-up patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Early mortality is noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Continued prospective observation of these patients is warranted </plain></SENT>
