<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of hearing loss in a population of 75 adult (19-68 years old) transfusion-dependent patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e>, Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and various other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> treated with regular transfusion schedules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three percent (70/75) of patients had a history of long-term subcutaneous or intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients underwent routine otolaryngologic history and physical examination, along with standard pure-tone audiometry at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, with hearing loss defined as 25 dB or greater at one or more frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hearing loss was present in 57% (43/75) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More importantly, hearing loss attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> was present in 29% (22/75) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients treated previously with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> were switched to the experimental oral chelating agent, L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of these 16 patients had hearing loss attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi>, with 5 of these patients worsening with the experimental oral chelating agent L1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine percent (59/75) of patients were thalassemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four percent (33/59) of these thalassemic patients had hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 35% (21/59) of the thalassemic patients had hearing loss attributable to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> thalassemic patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> had high-frequency <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, with 33% (7/21) having a notch at 6 kHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, 5% (1/21) had notching at 3 khz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Few of the hearing losses were disabling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Management of these patients requires proper dosing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">desferrioxamine</z:chebi> and transfusion therapy, along with regular monitoring of body iron burden and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, regular otolaryngologic and audiometric follow-up with special care to include the frequencies of 3 and 6 kHz may help recognize and prevent permanent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235280" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ototoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
