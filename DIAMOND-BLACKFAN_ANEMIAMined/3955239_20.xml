<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the etiology of congenital hypoplastic or Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) we investigated in vitro erythropoiesis in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the nine, seven were clinically responsive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four were infants evaluated at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six were never or were only minimally transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those for whom <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> had been prescribed had discontinued the drug a minimum of five months prior to study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bone marrows of these nine patients were compared with those of hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and with those of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005510'>transient erythroblastopenia</z:hpo> of childhood (TEC) whose erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was as severe as that of the patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the plasma clot semisolid culture technique to enumerate erythroid progenitors and to evaluate the growth characteristics of the colonies to which they give rise, we concluded that at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>: (a) erythroid progenitor frequency does not correlate with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e>; (b) erythroid progenitor differentiation may in some cases be abnormally insensitive to crude preparations of erythropoietin; and (c) progenitor erythropoietin insensitivity in vitro does not necessarily indicate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> insensitivity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> does not appear to be solely the result of deficient formation of erythroid progenitors but is, in addition, a disorder that is due to defective progenitor differentiation in vivo </plain></SENT>
