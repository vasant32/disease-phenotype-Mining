<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>hIK was found to be identical to two recently cloned K+ channels, hSK4 and hIK1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> dot blot analysis showed a widespread tissue expression, with the highest levels in salivary gland, placenta, trachea, and lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With use of fluorescent in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping, hIK mapped to chromosome 19q13.2 in the same region as the disease Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stable expression of hIK in HEK-293 cells revealed single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi>-activated K+ channels exhibiting weak inward rectification (30 and 11 pS at -100 and +100 mV, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whole cell recordings showed a noninactivating, inwardly rectifying K+ conductance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ionic selectivity estimated from bi-ionic reversal potentials gave the permeability (PK/PX) sequence K+ = Rb+ (1.0) &gt; Cs+ (10.4) &gt;&gt; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>, Li+, N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-D-glucamine (&gt;51) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NH+4 blocked the channel completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hIK was blocked by the classical inhibitors of the Gardos channel charybdotoxin (IC50 28 nM) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3764">clotrimazole</z:chebi> (IC50 153 nM) as well as by nitrendipine (IC50 27 nM), Stichodactyla toxin (IC50 291 nM), margatoxin (IC50 459 nM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6923">miconazole</z:chebi> (IC50 785 nM), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4754">econazole</z:chebi> (IC50 2.4 microM), and cetiedil (IC50 79 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone, an opener of the T84 cell IK channel, activated hIK with an EC50 of 74 microM </plain></SENT>
