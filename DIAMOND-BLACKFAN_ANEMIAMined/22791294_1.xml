<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a case study reported a patient who became transfusion-independent in response to treatment with the amino acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have validated the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> using our recently generated mouse model for RPS19-deficient <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> significantly improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in Rps19-deficient mice (19% improvement in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration; 18% increase in the number of erythrocytes), increased the bone marrow cellularity, and alleviated stress hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the therapeutic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> appeared specific for Rps19-deficient hematopoiesis and was associated with down-regulation of p53 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study supports the rationale for clinical trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15603,30006">L-leucine</z:chebi> as a therapeutic agent for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
