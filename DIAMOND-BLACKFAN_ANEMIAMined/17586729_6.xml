<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Difficult to treat and typified by a poor prognosis, their pathogenesis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent findings that some patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e> Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) have mutations in ribosomal proteins have led to the idea that this and perhaps other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> disorders result from an inadequate supply of normally functioning ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to this hypothesis, an insufficiency of the protein synthetic capacity limits the replicative potential of cells, with the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> disease phenotype in particular arising from a block of one or more of the two to four critical, temporally compressed cell divisions in the differentiation program of the erythroid lineage in the fetal liver and the postnatal bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here I propose an alternative (but not mutually exclusive) hypothesis centered on nucleoli: the specialized intranuclear domains within which ribosomes are assembled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was recently discovered that the nucleoli contain cell cycle machinery in close proximity to nascent ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in ribosomal proteins might be expected to negatively influence the cell's protein synthetic capacity, I suggest it is also possible that the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> mutations directly affect the nucleolus to destabilize or otherwise deregulate the coresident cell cycle machinery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis envisions that the ribosomal protein mutations discovered in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> act upstream from ribosome assembly by interfering with the staging of cell cycle progression machinery in the nucleolus, in a pretranslational mode of pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
