<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) patients possess mutations in genes coding for ribosomal proteins (RPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify new mutations, we investigated large deletions in the RP genes RPL5, RPL11, RPL35A, RPS7, RPS10, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, and RPS26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed an easy method based on quantitative-PCR in which the threshold cycle correlates to gene copy number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we were able to diagnose 7 of 27 Japanese patients (25.9%) possessing mutations that were not detected by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these large deletions, similar results were obtained with 6 of 7 patients screened with a single nucleotide polymorphism array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found an extensive intragenic deletion in RPS19, including exons 1-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found 1 proband with an RPL5 deletion, 1 patient with an RPL35A deletion, 3 with RPS17 deletions, and 1 with an RPS19 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, the large deletions in the RPL5 and RPS17 alleles are novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a large deletion had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that large deletions in RP genes comprise a sizable fraction of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, our novel approach may become a useful tool for screening gene copy numbers of known <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> genes </plain></SENT>
