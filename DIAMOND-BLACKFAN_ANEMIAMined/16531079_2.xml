<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RPS19 is mutated in 25% of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, but its role in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> pathogenesis remains elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a novel heterozygous microdeletion in RPS19 in a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patient presenting with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deletion of 18 nucleotides (233-250; A in start codon is +1) in exon 4 leads to the elimination of 6 amino acids 78IYGGRQ83, affecting the most conserved stretch of three amino acids (YGG) in RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutated allele was not detected in the patient's family members, indicating de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both alleles were expressed at the same level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using an immunofluorescence technique, the mutated RPS19 protein localized to nucleoli, and its intracellular distribution did not differ from the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deletion of only a few amino acids of this protein with a preserved reading frame is rare, and this type of a mutation could be very helpful in further experiments to define the role of the RPS19 protein in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
