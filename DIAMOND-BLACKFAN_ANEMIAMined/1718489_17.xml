<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations at either the W or Steel loci in the mouse also leads to a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo>, as well as other developmental abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The W locus encodes the proto-oncogene c-kit, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, while the Steel locus encodes a potent hematopoietic growth factor that is the ligand for c-kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Growth of clonogenic marrow erythroid progenitor cells in vitro in the presence of the recombinant hematopoietic growth factors interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Steel was used to characterize this disease at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patterns of in vitro marrow response to both recombinant IL-3 or Steel were observed among 10 Diamond-Blackfan patients: those that responded quantitatively and qualitatively almost as well as cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow, those that responded at an intermediate level, and those that did not respond at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence for cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> underlying the pathogenesis of this disorder and therefore raise the possibility that there may be more than one underlying molecular basis for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No gross abnormalities in the structure of either the c-kit or Steel loci were observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response in culture of the progenitor cells from at least some patients to Steel with or without IL-3 raises the possibility of using this novel growth factor as a therapeutic agent in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
