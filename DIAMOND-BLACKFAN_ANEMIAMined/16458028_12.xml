<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical expression of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is highly variable, and subclinical phenotypes may be revealed by elevated erythrocyte deaminase (eADA) activity only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In mice, complete loss of Rps19 results in early <z:mp ids='MP_0008762'>embryonic lethality</z:mp> whereas Rps19+/- mice are viable and without major abnormalities including the hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed a detailed analysis of the Rps19+/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We estimated the Rps19 levels in hematopoietic tissues and we analyzed erythrocyte deaminase activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> isoforms which are used as markers for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of a disrupted Rps19 allele on a different genetic background was investigated as well as the response to erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From our results, we argue that the loss of one Rps19 allele in mice is fully compensated for at the transcriptional level with preservation of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
