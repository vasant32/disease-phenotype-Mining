<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although incompletely understood, the erythroid failure in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> appears to result from the accelerated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of affected erythroid progenitors/precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of what appears to be multiple <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> genes, coding for a ribosomal protein RPS 19, has been cloned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Even within multiplex families individuals may vary dramatically as to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, response to treatment and the presence of congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> Registry (DBAR), a comprehensive database of pediatric and adult patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> who are enrolled after informed consent, was designed to overcome two significant obstacles encountered in the study of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e>; the reporting bias inherent in the literature and the lack of an active patient database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To enroll, patients, their families and their physicians complete a detailed questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A review of medical records and telephone interviews are performed to complete and clarify the information provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As of May 1, 2005, 420 patients have been enrolled in the DBAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data have been collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The DBAR has provided new information on the clinical presentation, outcome and genetics of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> as well as a better description of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> predisposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This has resulted both in improved clinical care of patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> as well as providing new insights into the pathophysiology of this complex disorder </plain></SENT>
