<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic understanding of the role of RPS19 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythropoiesis and in the Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> defect is still poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, defective ribosome biogenesis and, in particular, impaired 18S <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> maturation have been documented in association with various identified RPS19 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, new genes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> encoding ribosomal proteins, have been found to be mutated in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, adding further support to the concept that ribosome biogenesis plays an important role in regulating erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We previously showed variability in the levels of expression and subcellular localization of a subset of RPS19 mutant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To define the mechanistic basis for this variability better, we studied a large number of mutant proteins and characterized both RPS19 expression level using a specific antibody against RPS19 and RPS19 subcellular localization after transfection of Cos-7 cells with various green fluorescent protein-RPS19 mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of the proteasome in RPS19 degradation, we examined the effect of various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi>, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52722">lactacystin</z:chebi>, MG132, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52717">bortezomib</z:chebi> on RPS19 expression and subcellular localization RESULTS: We found two distinct classes of RPS19 protein defects in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> based on the stability of the mutant proteins: (i) slightly decreased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nucleolar localization and (ii) markedly deficient expression and failure to localize to the nucleolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52726">proteasome inhibitors</z:chebi> tested were able to restore the expression levels and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subcellular localization of several unstable mutant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate an important role for the proteasomal degradation pathway in regulating the expression levels and nucleolar localization of certain mutant RPS19 proteins in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
