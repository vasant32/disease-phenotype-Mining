<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> admitted in our hospital from Dec 2008 to Aug 2012 were screened by PCR for mutations in the nine known genes associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, RPS7, RPL35a, RPS10 and RPS26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results found that 8 patients (38.1%) with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> had mutations in the genes coding for ribosomal protein, in which RPS19 mutation was identified in 3 patients, RPS24, RPS7, RPL5, RPL11 and RPL35A mutations were identified respectively in 1 of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mutations were detected in RPS17, RPS10 or RPS26 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thumb anomalies were found in 2 patients with RPL11 or RPL5 mutation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000047'>hypospadias</z:hpo> was found in 1 patient with RPS19 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the mutation frequency of the genes coding for ribosomal protein in the patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> here is lower than that in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000047'>hypospadias</z:hpo> can be observed in some patients with RPS19 mutation and some dactyl anomalies are associated with RPL11 and RPL5 mutations </plain></SENT>
