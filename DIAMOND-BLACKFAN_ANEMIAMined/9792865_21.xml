<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A major <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> locus has previously been localized to chromosome 19q13.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples from additional families have been collected to identify key recombinations, microdeletions, and the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In total, 29 multiplex <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families and 50 families that comprise <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cases have been analyzed with polymorphic 19q13 markers, including a newly identified short-tandem repeat in the critical gene region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from DNA analysis of 29 multiplex families revealed that 26 of these were consistent with a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> gene on 19q localized to within a 4.1-cM interval restricted by loci D19S200 and D19S178; however, in three multiplex families, the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> candidate region on 19q13 was excluded from the segregation of marker alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, and we show that a gene region on chromosome 19q segregates with the disease in the majority of familial cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 50 families comprising <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cases, we identified two novel and overlapping microdeletions on chromosome 19q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In combination, the three known microdeletions associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> restrict the critical gene region to approximately 1 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that a proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cases are caused by deletions in the 19q13 region </plain></SENT>
