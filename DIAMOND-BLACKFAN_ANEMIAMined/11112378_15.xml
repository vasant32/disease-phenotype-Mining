<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, but dominant or, more rarely, recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> is observed in 10% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) S19 have recently been found in 25% of patients with either the dominant or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is the first human disease due to mutations in a ribosomal structural protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Families unlinked to this locus have also been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an investigation of 23 individuals, we identified eight different mutations in 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These include five missense, one frameshift, one splice site defect, and one 4-bp insertion in the regulatory sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven mutations are new; one has so far been found in 8 patients and is a relatively common de novo event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two mutations are predicted to generate a truncated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also report the prevalence of RPS 19 mutations in the Italian <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> population, as shown by an analysis of 56 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main clinical applications for molecular analysis are clinical diagnosis of patients with an incomplete form of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and testing of siblings of a patient with a severe form so as to avoid using those who carry a mutation and a silent phenotype as allogeneic stem cell donors </plain></SENT>
