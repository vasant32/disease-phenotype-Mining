<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The W mutation involves the gene for c-kit, and the S1 mutation the gene for the kit ligand, called mast cell growth factor, steel factor, or stem cell factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since many children with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> respond to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, we administered steroids to these genetically anemic mice, to determine whether they might provide a model for the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no improvement in the murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, consistent with other evidence suggesting that mutations in kit or steel may not be involved in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
