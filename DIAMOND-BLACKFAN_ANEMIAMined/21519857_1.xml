<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Yeast ribosomal protein L11 is positioned at the intersubunit cleft of the large subunit central protuberance, forming an intersubunit bridge with the small subunit protein S18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutants were engineered in the central core region of L11 which interacts with Helix 84 of the 25S rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous mutants in this region conferred 60S subunit biogenesis defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, many mutations of F96 and the A66D mutant promoted formation of halfmers as assayed by <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> density ultracentrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Halfmer formation was not due to deficiency in 60S subunit production, suggesting that the mutants affected subunit-joining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chemical modification analyses indicated that the A66D mutant, but not the F96 mutants, promoted changes in 25S rRNA structure, suggesting at least two modalities for subunit joining defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>25S rRNA structural changes were located both adjacent to A66D (in H84), and more distant (in H96-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While none of the mutants significantly affected ribosome/tRNA binding constants, they did have strong effects on cellular growth at both high and low temperatures, in the presence of translational inhibitors, and promoted changes in translational fidelity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two distinct mechanisms are proposed by which L11 mutants may affect subunit joining, and identification of the amino acids associated with each of these processes are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for our understanding of multifaceted diseases such as Diamond--Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> which have been linked in part with mutations in L11 </plain></SENT>
