<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor (SCF) is a determining and crucial element in the development of early hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SCF receptor protein has been identified as the product of the protooncogene c-kit and has been detected using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) on a broad selection of erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid cell lines as well as on bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SCF is known to increase both the number and size of burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colonies in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human BM culture in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A detailed study of the involvement of SCF and its receptor c-kit in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythropoiesis will help elucidate intrinsic irregularities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> such as Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>, an aregenerative congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder are confined to the red cell lineage and are thought to arise through a defect at the stem/progenitor cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our in vitro studies suggest that SCF therapy will influence BFU-E production in at least a portion of these patients, although in another group, SCF response is limited or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, further investigations have shown a possible c-kit signaling defect that clearly necessitates further c-kit characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To parallel this, we, therefore, attempted to study the relationship of c-kit with its ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report describes a nonradioactive method for detecting SCF receptors that varies from conventional assays in that the fluorescent label conjugated to the SCF/c-kit complex is connected via an extended-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> linkage that reduces steric influence and promotes full <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> structural ligand binding of the SCF to its receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
