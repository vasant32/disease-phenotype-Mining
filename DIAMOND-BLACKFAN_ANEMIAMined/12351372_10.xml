<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 47-year-old woman with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> markedly improved during the second and third trimesters of 3 pregnancies and when breast-feeding her 2 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because the serum prolactin level is elevated at these times, we later treated her with metoclopramide (10 mg orally 3 times daily), a medication known to induce prolactin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her serum prolactin levels increased from 7 to 133 ng/mL (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> &lt; 20 ng/mL) and hematocrit from 17% to 22% to 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With continued therapy (now 10 mg orally daily), her hematocrit has ranged from 30% to 40% for 6 years, although the <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> persists (mean corpuscular volume, 100-112 fL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this observation, a pilot study was undertaken of metoclopramide therapy in patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> who were refractory to low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were enrolled and 9 completed the planned 16 weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three individuals responded, suggesting that this therapeutic approach may benefit others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As with the index case, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> did not improve until 12 to 15 weeks of therapy had been completed </plain></SENT>
