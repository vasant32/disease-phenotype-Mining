<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Usually, erythropoiesis in vitro is defective, and decreased numbers of erythroid progenitors are found in colony assays performed with bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, some investigators showed that thrombopoietin (TPO) also works on common multipotent progenitor cells and stimulates erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of TPO together with erythropoietin (EPO), stem cell factor (SCF), and/or interleukin-3 (IL-3) on erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) of bone marrow nonadherent mononuclear cells from 2 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> using a serum-free culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Very few BFU-E appeared in cultures containing EPO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adding IL-3, SCF, or both to cultures containing EPO induced an increase in the number of BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When TPO was added to cultures containing EPO and IL-3, SCF, or both, the number of BFU-E further increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially in patient 2, BFU-E formation was grossly equal to that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TPO enhances bone marrow erythropoiesis in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> in the presence of EPO and SCF and/or IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data raise the possibility of the combination of TPO and SCF as a therapeutic agent in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
