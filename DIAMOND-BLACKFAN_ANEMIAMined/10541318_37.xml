<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is a constitutional disease characterized by a specific maturation defect in cells of erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have assembled a registry of 229 DBA patients, which includes 151 patients from France, 70 from Germany, and eight from other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presence of malformations was significantly and independently associated with familial history of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> at presentation (before any steroid therapy), and absence of hypotrophy at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred twenty-two patients were available for long-term follow-up analysis (median, 111.5 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these individuals, 62.6% initially responded to steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial steroid responsiveness was found significantly and independently associated with older age at presentation, familial history of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet count at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe evolution of the disease (transfusion dependence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was significantly and independently associated with a younger age at presentation and with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with a familial history of the disease experienced a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome analysis revealed the benefit of reassessing steroid responsiveness during the course of the disease for initially nonresponsive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation was successful in 11/13 cases; HLA typing of probands and siblings should be performed early if patients are transfusion dependent, and cord blood should be preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> (assessed for France over a 13-y period) is 7.3 cases per million live births without effect of seasonality on incidence of the disease or on malformative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no parental imprinting effect or anticipation phenomenon could be documented in families with dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
