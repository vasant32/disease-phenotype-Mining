<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is a rare, pure red blood cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of childhood caused by an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Malformations occur in about 40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than half of patients respond to steroids; non-responders need <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusions or stem cell transplantation (SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 are found in 25% of patients, but the link with erythropoiesis is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> locus has been found on chromosome 8p22-p23; analysis of genes of the region is in progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND INFORMATION SOURCES: We present clinical and molecular data from 97 Italian <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients and a review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND STATE OF THE ART: We describe five new RPS19 gene mutations: four point mutations and one unbalanced chromosomal translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematologic findings, malformations and outcome are similar in the RPS19 mutated and the non-mutated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No genotype-phenotype correlation has been found so far in RPS19 mutated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data, however, and a thorough review of literature show a worse outcome (expressed as transfusion dependence) in patients with mutations that completely abolish one allele, i.e. gross chromosomal rearrangements and mutations at the initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> with large deletions at the 19q locus points to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A recurrent missense mutation (Arg62Trp) is associated with transfusion dependence in eight of the nine reported cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PERSPECTIVES: Nationwide collaboration and population-based registries recording molecular data are essential for the further dissection of this rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disease and the definition of new therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
