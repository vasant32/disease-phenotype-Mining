<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Production of ribosomes is a fundamental process that occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dividing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a complex process consisting of the coordinated synthesis and assembly of four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNAs</z:chebi> (rRNA) with about 80 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) involving more than 150 nonribosomal proteins and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is an inherited red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> caused by mutations in one of several r-proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>How defects in r-proteins, essential for proliferation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells, lead to a human disease with a specific defect in red cell development is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the role of r-proteins in ribosome biogenesis in order to find out whether those mutated in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> have any similarities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We depleted HeLa cells using siRNA for several individual r-proteins of the small (RPS6, RPS7, RPS15, RPS16, RPS17, RPS19, RPS24, RPS25, RPS28) or large subunit (RPL5, RPL7, RPL11, RPL14, RPL26, RPL35a) and studied the effect on rRNA processing and ribosome production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Depleting r-proteins in one of the subunits caused, with a few exceptions, a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> r-proteins of the same subunit and a decrease in the corresponding subunit, fully assembled ribosomes, and polysomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R-protein <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, with a few exceptions, led to the accumulation of specific rRNA precursors, highlighting their individual roles in rRNA processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of r-proteins mutated in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> always compromised ribosome biogenesis while affecting either subunit and disturbing rRNA processing at different levels, indicating that the rate of ribosome production rather than a specific step in ribosome biogenesis is critical in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
