<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The representative diseases with trilineage involvement are Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita, while the disease with the single lineage cytopenia is Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in our understanding of these diseases have come from the identification of genetic lesions responsible for the disease and their pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although recent studies have identified many causative genes, mutations of these genes have only been found in less than half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing technologies may reveal new causative genes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, induced pluripotent stem cells derived from patients with CBMFS will be useful to study the pathophysiology of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only long-term curative treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although this procedure has a risk of severe adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multicenter prospective studies are warranted to establish appropriate conditioning regimens aimed at reducing transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
