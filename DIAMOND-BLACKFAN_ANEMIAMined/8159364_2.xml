<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 90% of the patients are diagnosed by 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report presents two pregnancies with good outcomes in a patient over a period of 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE: The patient, a 20-year-old woman, was diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> at age 3.5 months </plain></SENT>
