<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the substantial phenotypic overlap necessitates comparative analysis between the IBMFSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) is an IBMFS that the appreciation of what comprises its clinical phenotype is still evolving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this analysis we used data on 125 patients from the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Study (CIMFS), which is a prospective multicenter population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four cases of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> patients were analyzed and compared to other patients with the four most common IBMFSs on the CIMFS: Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kostmann</z:e>/severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, FA and DC was often delayed relative to symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; indicating a major need for improving tools to establish a rapid diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified multiple phenotypic differences between <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> and other IBMFSs, including several novel differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SBDS biallelic mutations were less frequent than in previous reports (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, compared to patients with biallelic mutations, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> SBDS had more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> but milder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, comprehensive study of the IBMFSs can provide useful comparative data between the disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SBDS-negative <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> patients may have more severe hematological failure and milder <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030286" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pancreatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
