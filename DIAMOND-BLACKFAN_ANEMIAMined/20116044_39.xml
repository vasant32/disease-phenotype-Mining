<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is the most prominent feature of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, the disease is also characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e>, in particular craniofacial, upper limb, heart, and urinary system defects that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7, in about 43% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To continue our large-scale screen of RP genes in a <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> population, we sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes, RPL15, RPL24, RPL29, RPL32, RPL34, RPL9, RPL37, RPS14, RPS23, RPL10A, RPS10, RPS12, RPS18, RPL30, RPS20, RPL12, RPL7A, RPS6, RPL27A, RPLP2, RPS25, RPS3, RPL41, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS26, RPL21, RPL36AL, RPS29, RPL4, RPLP1, RPL13, RPS15A, RPS2, and RPL38, in our <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patient cohort of 117 probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified three distinct mutations of RPS10 in five probands and nine distinct mutations of RPS26 in 12 probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knockdown of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicates that mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients affect the function of the proteins in rRNA processing </plain></SENT>
