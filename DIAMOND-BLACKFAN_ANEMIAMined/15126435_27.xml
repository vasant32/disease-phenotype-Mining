<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) has become an option for couples for whom termination of an affected pregnancy identified by traditional prenatal diagnosis is unacceptable and is applicable to indications beyond those of prenatal diagnosis, such as HLA matching to affected siblings to provide stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe preimplantation HLA typing, not involving identification of a causative gene, for couples who had children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorders</z:e> at need for HLA-matched stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: HLA matching procedures conducted at a single site during 2002-2003 in an in vitro fertilization program for 9 couples with children affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, or Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> requiring HLA-matched stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 13 clinical cycles, DNA in single blastomeres removed from 8-cell embryos following in vitro fertilization was analyzed for HLA genes simultaneously with analysis for short tandem repeats in the HLA region to select and transfer only those embryos that were HLA matched to affected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of HLA matching and pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As a result of testing a total of 199 embryos, 45 (23%) HLA-matched embryos were selected, of which 28 were transferred in 12 clinical cycles, resulting in 5 singleton pregnancies and birth of 5 HLA-matched healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first known experience of preimplantation HLA typing performed without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> for a causative gene, providing couples with a realistic option of having HLA-matched offspring to serve as potential donors of stem cells for their affected siblings </plain></SENT>
