<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper examines the natural history of 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic features and mutation data (where available) were reviewed, but no significant differences were found that predicted severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
