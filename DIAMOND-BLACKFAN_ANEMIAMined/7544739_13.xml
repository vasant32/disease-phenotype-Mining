<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To characterize the production of stem cell factor (SCF, the ligand for the c-kit receptor protein) and its regulation by inflammatory cytokines and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, primary marrow stromal fibroblasts were isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and two patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unstimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow stromal fibroblasts constitutively expressed a low level of SCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (9 +/- 2 copies/cell [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]), continually secreted soluble SCF into the supernatant of 1- to 5-day-old cultures (0.16 +/- 0.02 to 0.73 +/- 0.04 ng/mL per 10(6) cells, respectively), and expressed membrane-bound SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stimulation with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) only modestly increased SCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, soluble SCF production at 24 hours, and membrane-bound SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNF-alpha) exposure increased SCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels 3.5- to four-fold above controls, but with different kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak TNF-alpha effect was at 6 hours, with return to near control levels at 24 hours, whereas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> induced maximal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increases at 12 to 18 hours, and the levels remained high at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a sustained increase in soluble SCF production was detected during 1 to 5 days of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> exposure (0.27 +/- 0.03 to 1.10 +/- 0.08 ng/mL per 10(6) cells), while TNF-alpha stimulation modestly increased the production of soluble SCF in 24-hour cultures only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unstimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow fibroblasts expressed predominantly the long species of alternatively spliced SCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and the relative amounts of long and short <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> did not change after stimulation with IL-1 beta, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi>, or TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCF production by marrow stromal fibroblasts from a symptomatic patient with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was equivalent to simultaneously studied <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, marrow fibroblasts from a Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patient in untreated hematologic remission constitutively expressed high levels of SCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (21 +/- 4 copies/cell) and soluble protein (0.40 ng/mL per 10(6) cells at 24 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations suggest that SCF is constitutively produced by fibroblasts in the human marrow microenvironment and that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> induces a modest but sustained increase in SCF gene expression and protein production, compared to only a transient increase induced by TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, these findings support the hypothesis that endogenous or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-induced increases in the production of SCF could play a physiologic role in the clinical improvement of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
