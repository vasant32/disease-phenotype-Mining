<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The similarity of findings shared between our cases and a female reported by Hasan and Inoue [1993] suggests that this is a distinctive syndrome, rather than a chance association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder, caused in about 25% of cases by heterozygous mutations in the RPS19 gene (DBA1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis in our cases did not show an RPS19 mutation, and 2 alleles were present in each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Segregation analysis for DBA1 on chromosome 19 and DBA2 on 8p23 was not consistent with linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008551'>microtia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is not allelic to known <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> loci </plain></SENT>
