<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is a rare, clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, congenital red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>: 40% of patients have congenital abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that in western countries, the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in about 50% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RPS14 was also examined due to its implied involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q- syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations in RPS19, RPL5, RPL11 and RPS17 were identified in five, four, two and one of the probands, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 12 (27%) of the Japanese Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients had mutations in ribosomal protein genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutations were detected in RPS14, RPS24 or RPL35A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with RPS19 and RPL5 mutations had physical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> was seen in two patients with RPL5 mutations, and thumb anomalies were seen in six patients with an RPS19 or RPL5 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a small-for-date phenotype was seen in five patients without an RPL5 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed a slightly lower frequency of mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> compared to the frequency reported in western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype data suggest an association between anomalies and RPS19 mutations, and a negative association between small-for-date phenotype and RPL5 mutations </plain></SENT>
