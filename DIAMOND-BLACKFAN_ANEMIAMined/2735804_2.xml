<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dosage and the route of administration (IV, IM, SC) were adapted to the amount of iron transfused and to the nature of the disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were established between the quantities of iron transfused, ferritin levels, and parameters such as dosage, route of administration and compliance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31460">Desferal</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
