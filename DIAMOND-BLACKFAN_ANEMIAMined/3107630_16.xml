<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple and reliable cytogenetic test for Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) that is based on the hypersensitivity of FA cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (MC) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Equal volumes of whole blood from a patient in whom the diagnosis of FA is suspected and from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> person of the opposite sex are co-cultured in phytohemagglutinin-containing medium in the presence and absence of MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After five days' co-cultivation, 100 quinacrine-stained metaphases from both the MC-containing and the MC-free cultures are examined for the presence of a Y chromosome using fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bona fide FA patients in whom testing was successful, hypersensitivity to MC was readily demonstrated by the striking deficiency of FA metaphases (0.9% to 14.9%) in the MC-containing co-cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the three patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and none of the five with undiagnosed conditions reminiscent of FA exhibited hypersensitivity to MC; cells from them, from parents of FA patients, and from several <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laboratory personnel constituted approximately half of the metaphases (40.4% to 71.2%) of MC-containing co-cultures, as would be expected in the absence of hypersensitivity to MC </plain></SENT>
