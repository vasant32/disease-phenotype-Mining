<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic defect of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) results in selective failure of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, it is not known whether this defect originates from an intrinsic impediment of hematopoietic progenitors to move forward along the erythroid pathway or to the impaired capacity of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment to support proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduced longevity of long-term bone marrow cultures, the most physiologic in vitro system to study the interactions of hematopoietic progenitors and hematopoietic microenvironment, is consistent with a defect of an early hematopoietic progenitor in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, stromal adherent layers from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients generated in a long-term culture system, the in vitro counterpart of BM microenvironment, did not show evidence of any morphologic, phenotypic, or functional abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our major finding was an impaired capacity of enriched CD34+ BM cell fraction from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, cultured in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM stromal cells, to proliferate and differentiate along the erythroid pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A similar impairment was observed in some <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients along the granulomacrophage pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our result points to an intrinsic defect of a hematopoietic progenitor with bilineage potential that is earlier than previously suspected as a relevant pathogenetic mechanism of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of impaired granulopoiesis in some <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients underlines the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
