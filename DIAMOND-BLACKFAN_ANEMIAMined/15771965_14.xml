<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No models exist for RPS19-deficient <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and the molecular pathogenesis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To establish an in vitro inducible model for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, human erythroid leukemic cell lines, TF-1 and UT-7 cells, were cotransduced with a lentiviral vector expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (siRNA) against RPS19 controlled by a tet operator regulatory element and another transactivator vector containing the red fluorescent protein (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi>) gene and the cDNA encoding a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi>-controllable transcriptional repressor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following transduction, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28077">RFP</z:chebi>-positive and GFP-negative cell population was sorted by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon incubation with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> (0.5 mug/ml), more than 98% of cells expressed GFP and the siRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant suppression of erythroid differentiation, cell growth, and colony formation was observed in cells treated with siRNA against RPS19 but not in cells treated with a control vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings show that RPS19 plays an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic cell proliferation and erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These novel cell lines represent models for RPS19-deficient <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and can be used to identify the molecular mechanisms in RPS19-deficient <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
