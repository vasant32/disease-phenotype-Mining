<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding the small subunit ribosomal protein 19 (RPS19) is mutated in about 25% of cases of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a childhood disease characterized by failure of red cell production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cases <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait and RPS19 haploinsufficiency is thought to cause the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the molecular pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> we used siRNA to decrease the level of RPS19 in two human cell lines, HeLa cells and U-2 OS <z:hpo ids='HP_0002669'>osteosarcoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells with reduced RPS19 levels showed a dramatic reduction in the amounts of small 40S ribosome subunits and mature 80S ribosomes and an excess of large 60S subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells were defective in 18S rRNA production and accumulated 21S and 20S nuclear pre-rRNA molecules, suggesting that RPS19 is required for specific steps in rRNA processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RPS19 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> produced a reduction in steady-state levels of RPS6 and RPS16 via a post-transcriptional mechanism while the levels of RPL7 and RPL26 were unaltered, indicating that levels of ribosomal proteins are determined by subunit assembly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This has interesting implications for the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> suggesting that deficiency of any of the RPS proteins might have a similar effect and thus may be responsible for causing <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally in cell lines from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients with mutations we find increased levels of 21S rRNA precursors but no abnormality in the ribosome profile on <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> gradients or in the steady-state levels of RPS19 suggesting that some cells can partially compensate for the loss of one allele of RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that defects in ribosome biogenesis may underlie the pathology of Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
