<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The p53 pathway is activated by ribosome dysfunction, but the molecular basis for selective impairment of the erythroid lineage in disorders of ribosome function has not been determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that p53 accumulates selectively in the erythroid lineage in primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells after expression of shRNAs targeting RPS14, the ribosomal protein gene deleted in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>, or RPS19, the most commonly mutated gene in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction of p53 led to lineage-specific accumulation of p21 and consequent cell cycle arrest in erythroid progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pharmacologic inhibition of p53 rescued the erythroid defect, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46742">nutlin-3</z:chebi>, a compound that activates p53 through inhibition of HDM2, selectively impaired erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In bone marrow biopsies from patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> or del(5q) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, we found an accumulation of nuclear p53 staining in erythroid progenitor cells that was not present in control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the erythroid lineage has a low threshold for the induction of p53, providing a basis for the failure of erythropoiesis in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">5q-syndrome</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, and perhaps other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
