<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGNS: We prospectively treated eight patients with transfusion-dependent Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with high intravenous doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had previously not responded to one or more oral courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> in standard doses and were dependent on erythrocyte transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Every patient initially received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> at a dose of 30 mg/kg per day, followed by slow tapering for 4 weeks, but none responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients then received a second treatment course starting at 100 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> per kilogram per day, again followed by slow tapering of the dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients had a complete response that has been sustained for 21+, 31+, and 41+ months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Toxic effects included a rise in serum alanine aminotransferase activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in one child, and three episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> in two patients with intravenous access devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that very high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> may induce sustained remission in some patients with transfusion-dependent Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> refractory to standard-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
