<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As described in this issue of JCI, Sankaran, Gazda, and colleagues used genome-wide exome sequencing to study <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients with no detectable mutations in RP genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They identified two unrelated pedigrees in which the disease is associated with mutations in GATA1, which encodes an essential hematopoietic transcription factor with no known mechanistic links to ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings ignite an interesting and potentially emotional debate on how we define <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and whether the term should be restricted to pure ribosomopathies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More generally, the work reflects the powerful knowledge and controversies arising from the deluge of data generated by new genetic technologies that are being used to analyze human diseases </plain></SENT>
