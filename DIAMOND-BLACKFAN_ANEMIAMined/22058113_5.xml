<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is associated with developmental defects and profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes encoding a ribosomal protein of the small (e.g., RPS19) or large (e.g., RPL11) ribosomal subunit are found in more than half of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutations cause ribosomal haploinsufficiency, which reduces overall translation efficiency of cellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reduced the expression of Rps19 or Rpl11 in mouse erythroblasts and investigated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> polyribosome association, which revealed deregulated translation initiation of specific transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these were Bag1, encoding a Hsp70 cochaperone, and Csde1, encoding an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-binding protein, and both were expressed at increased levels in erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their translation initiation is cap independent and starts from an internal ribosomal entry site, which appeared sensitive to knockdown of Rps19 or Rpl11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse embryos lacking Bag1 die at embryonic day 13.5, with reduced erythroid colony forming cells in the fetal liver, and low Bag1 expression impairs erythroid differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of Csde1 impairs the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Protein but not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of BAG1 and CSDE1 was reduced in erythroblasts cultured from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that impaired internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> expressed at increased levels in erythroblasts contributes to the erythroid phenotype of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
