<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), characterized by impaired red cell production, is a rare condition that is usually symptomatic in early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess nationwide experiences of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> encountered over a period of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records of 56 patients diagnosed with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> were retrospectively reviewed from November 1984 to July 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen institutions, including 13 university hospitals, participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio of patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> was 1.67:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age of diagnosis was 4 months, and 74.1% were diagnosed before 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From 2000 to 2009, annual incidence was 6.6 cases per million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, 38.2% showed congenital defects: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001172'>thumb deformities</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of aorta</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was 5.1±1.9 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume was 93.4±11.6 fL, and mean number of reticulocytes was 19,700/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean cellularity of bone marrow was 75%, with myeloid:erythroid ratio of 20.4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After remission, 48.9% of patients did not need further steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> who received hematopoietic transplantation have survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> developed in 2 cases (3.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is similar to data already published, but our study had a male predilection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients responded to initial treatment with steroids, about half needed further steroids after remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to collect further data, including information regarding management pathways, from nationwide <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> registries, along with data on molecular analyses </plain></SENT>
