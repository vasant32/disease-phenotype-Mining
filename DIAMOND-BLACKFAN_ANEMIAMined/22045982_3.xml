<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perturbations of the ribosome appear to be critically important in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>; alterations in 9 different ribosomal protein genes have been identified in multiple unrelated families, along with rarer abnormalities of additional ribosomal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, at present, only 50% to 60% of patients have an identifiable genetic lesion by ribosomal protein gene sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism array to evaluate for regions of recurrent copy variation, we identified deletions at known <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>-related ribosomal protein gene loci in 17% (9 of 51) of patients without an identifiable mutation, including RPS19, RPS17, RPS26, and RPL35A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No recurrent regions of copy variation at novel loci were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because RPS17 is a duplicated gene with 4 copies in a diploid genome, we demonstrate haploinsufficient RPS17 expression and a small subunit <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> processing abnormality in patients harboring RPS17 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we report the novel identification of variable mosaic loss involving known <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> gene regions in 3 patients from 2 kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that ribosomal protein gene deletion is more common than previously suspected and should be considered a component of the initial genetic evaluation in cases of suspected <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
