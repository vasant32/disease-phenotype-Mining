<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Several reports describe children with refractory transfusion-dependent Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> who responded to extremely large doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limitations in available data prompted further exploration of this treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective treatment protocol was designed to test the efficacy and toxicity of oral megadose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> in children with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> who had previously failed to respond to standard doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and who were dependent on regular packed red blood cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, starting at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day, tapering slowly to 5 mg/kg per day at the end of 4 weeks and to 2 mg/kg per day after 7 weeks of induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapy was continued for a total of 23 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed by increase in peripheral blood reticulocytes and increase or stabilization in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, which was maintained during and after steroid tapering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine children with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were registered on the study, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease in four of the children failed to respond to megadose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other five patients demonstrated a partial or complete response during the initial 4 to 8 weeks of therapy, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequently experienced relapse during the ensuing 2 months as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dose was tapered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required resumption of transfusions, although one later remitted spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity of megadose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> was modest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: None of nine children with refractory Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treated with oral megadose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> exhibited a clinically significant response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Alternative therapeutic strategies are required </plain></SENT>
