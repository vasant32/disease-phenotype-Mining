<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients become symptomatic in the first year of life and it lasts lifelong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> 19q13 gene mutation was detected, and recent findings suggest another gene located on 8p23.3-p22 chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two sisters with mild clinical manifestations of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were studied at the Department of Paediatrics in the Osijek University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First symptoms in both of these patients were noticed at the age of 5 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> members of patients' family were genetically tested for known loci for this disease, but tests showed no genetical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by clinical symptoms, cytological findings and ex iuvantibus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that patients are in the group with good outlook, since minimal steroid therapy stabilized their symptoms, and they developed no <z:mp ids='MP_0002555'>addiction</z:mp> either to high-dosed steroids, or to transfusions </plain></SENT>
