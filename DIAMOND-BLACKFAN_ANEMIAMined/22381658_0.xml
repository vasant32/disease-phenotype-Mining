<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase activity and serum erythropoietin levels were measured and bone marrow analysis and clonogenic assays were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two different ribosomal proteins were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified mutations in five different ribosomal proteins in 28/39 patients (71.8%) from 23/34 families (67.6%) </plain></SENT>
