<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that deletion of either of the two genes encoding Rps19 in yeast severely affects the production of 40 S ribosomal subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rps19 is an essential protein that is strictly required for maturation of the 3'-end of 18 S rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of Rps19 results in the accumulation of aberrant pre-40 S particles retained in the nucleus that fail to associate with pre-ribosomal factors involved in late maturation steps, including Enp1, Tsr1, and Rio2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When introduced in yeast Rps19, amino acid substitutions found in Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients induce defects in the processing of the pre-rRNA similar to those observed in cells under-expressing Rps19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results uncover a pivotal role of Rps19 in the assembly and maturation of the pre-40 S particles and demonstrate for the first time the effect of Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>-associated mutations on the function of Rps19, strongly connecting the pathology to ribosome biogenesis </plain></SENT>
