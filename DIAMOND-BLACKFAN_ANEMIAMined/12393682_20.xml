<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the role of RPS19 in erythropoiesis is still to be defined, we performed studies on RPS19 expression during terminal erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis of the genomic sequences of human and mouse RPS19 genes enabled the identification of 4 conserved sequence elements in the 5' region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterization of transcriptional elements allowed the identification of the promoter in the human RPS19 gene and the localization of a strong regulatory element in the third conserved sequence element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By Northern blot and Western blot analyses of murine splenic erythroblasts infected with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>-inducing strain Friend virus (FAV cells), RPS19 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression were shown to decrease during terminal erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We anticipate that these findings will contribute to further development of our understanding of the contribution of RPS19 to erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
