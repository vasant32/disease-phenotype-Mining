<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus subgroup C receptor 1 (FLVCR1) is a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> exporter that maintains the intracellular <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FLVCR1 was previously assumed to be involved in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and it was recently reported that mutations in the FLVCR1 gene are found in patients with posterior column <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000510'>retinitis pigmentosa</z:hpo> (PCARP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four mutations in FLVCR1 (Asn121Asp, Cys192Arg, Ala241Thr, and Gly493Arg) are located within putative transmembrane domains; however, the effects of FLVCR1 mutations on PCARP are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the function of FLVCR1 mutants by using a fluorescent <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> analog as a transporter substrate, and found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 FLVCR1 mutants lost their <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> export activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanism responsible for this loss of activity, we determined the subcellular localization of FLVCR1 mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FLVCR1 mutants did not localize to the plasma membrane and were observed in intracellular structures, including lysosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the loss of function of FLVCR1 mutants is caused by their mislocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We examined the half-life of FLVCR1 in cells, which was &gt;16h for <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FLVCR1 compared with 2-4h for the mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we propose that FLVCR1 mutants failed to fold properly in the ER, were rapidly degraded in the lysosomes, and therefore, could not export <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> out of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, accumulation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> in FLVCR1-mutant cells could cause cellular toxicity </plain></SENT>
