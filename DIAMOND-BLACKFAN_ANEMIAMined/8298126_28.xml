<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate if accelerated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> contributes to the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a rare pure red blood cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of childhood, we studied the effect of erythropoietin (epo) deprivation on erythroid progenitors and precursors from the bone marrow of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients as compared with hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> in response to epo deprivation was evaluated by enumeration of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E)- and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E)-derived colonies in plasma clot semisolid culture and by the identification of typical DNA oligosomes by gel electrophoresis from marrow mononuclear cells in liquid culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients there was a marked decrease in CFU-E- and BFU-E-derived colony formation compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls at comparable time points of epo deprivation, with a complete loss of CFU-E-derived colonies in semisolid culture by 9 hours of epo deprivation versus 48 hours in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BFU-E-derived colony response to epo deprivation displayed a similar pattern of decrement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic changes assessed by the presence of characteristic DNA fragmentation began in the absence of epo deprivation and were readily detected within 3 hours of epo deprivation in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cultures versus 9 hours in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is characterized by accelerated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as measured by the loss of erythroid progenitor clonogenicity and increased progenitor and precursor DNA fragmentation leading to the formation of characteristic oligosomes, consistent with an intrinsic erythroid-progenitor defect in which increased sensitivity to epo deprivation results in erythroid failure </plain></SENT>
