<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RPS19 is the only gene yet to have been associated with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, but its relevance to erythroid differentiation is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for the stimulation of erythropoiesis by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> in patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> has not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that targeted degradation of the RPS19 transcript, through retroviral expression of short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (shRNAs), blocks the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells in cultured human CD34(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of RPS19-deficient cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> restores erythroid differentiation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated the molecular basis of pharmacologic therapies for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> using oligonucleotide microarrays to survey gene expression in CD34(+) cells treated with combinations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, erythropoietin, stem cell factor, and interleukin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> did not alter expression of RPS19 but activated a genetic program that includes a set of key hematopoietic regulatory genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genes specific to erythroid progenitor cells were up-regulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, while genes specific to nonerythroid lineages were down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deficiency of RPS19 therefore blocks proliferation of immature erythroid progenitor cells, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> activates proliferation of the same cell population through mechanisms independent of RPS19 </plain></SENT>
