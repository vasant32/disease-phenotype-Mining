<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The consequence of these mutations on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that RPS19 plays an essential role in biogenesis of the 40S small ribosomal subunit in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of RPS19 expression by siRNAs impairs 18S rRNA synthesis and formation of 40S subunits and induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HeLa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre-rRNA processing is altered, which leads to an arrest in the maturation of precursors to the 18S rRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, pre-40S particles are not exported to the cytoplasm and accumulate in the nucleoplasm of the cells in perinuclear dots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistently, we find that ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar organization is altered in skin fibroblasts from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients bearing mutations in the RPS19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, maturation of the 18S rRNA is also perturbed in cells from a patient bearing no RPS19-related mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is directly related to a defect in ribosome biogenesis and indicate that yet to be discovered <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>-related genes may be involved in the synthesis of the ribosomal subunits </plain></SENT>
