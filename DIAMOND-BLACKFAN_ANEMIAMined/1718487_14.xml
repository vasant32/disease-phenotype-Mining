<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To provide insights into the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, we examined the in vitro response of erythroid progenitors to the recently isolated ligand for c-kit (stem cell factor, SCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For these studies, marrow or blood mononuclear cells from 10 Diamond-Blackfan patients were cultured with erythropoietin (Ep), Ep and interleukin-3, Ep and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or Ep and lymphocyte conditioned media (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These combinations were tested in the presence or absence of SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean number of cells per erythroid burst increased 5 to 50-fold in cultures containing SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, many additional erythroid bursts were seen (mean increment 3.2 x baseline values) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients responded, there were differences among individuals in the sensitivity of their BFU-E to SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control studies, plateau frequencies of erythroid bursts were achieved with less than or equal to 10 ng/mL SCF, whereas in studies from the other four patients, over 50 ng/mL SCF was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data invite speculation that the c-kit receptor/ligand axis is involved in the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More importantly and regardless of whether the observed patterns of response reflect the primary defect or an epiphenomenon, our data strongly support a therapeutic trial of SCF in patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
