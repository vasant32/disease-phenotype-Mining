<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) have been identified in approximately 25% of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these mutations disrupt either the translation or stability of the RPS19 protein and are predicted to cause <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> by haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, approximately 30% of RPS19 mutations are missense mutations that do not alter the stability of the RPS19 protein and are hypothesized to act by a dominant negative mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To formally test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing an RPS19 mutation in which an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> is replaced with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32732">tryptophan residue</z:chebi> at codon 62 (RPS19R62W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Constitutive expression of RPS19R62W in developing mice was lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditional expression of RPS19R62W resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, and significant inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation, similar to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> profiling demonstrated more than 700 dysregulated genes belonging to the same pathways that are disrupted in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> profiles of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that RPS19R62W is a dominant negative <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> mutation </plain></SENT>
