<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed a high-throughput method to quantify <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32877">primary amine</z:chebi>-containing metabolites in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the use of capillary electrophoresis in combination with fluorescent derivatization of cell extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured amino acid levels in the yeast deletion collection, a set of approximately 5000 strains each lacking a single gene, and developed a computational pipeline for data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Amino acid peak assignments were validated by mass spectrometry, and the overall approach was validated by the result that expected pathway intermediates accumulate in mutants of the arginine biosynthetic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global analysis of the deletion collection was carried out using clustering methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We grouped strains based on their metabolite profiles, revealing clusters of mutants enriched for genes encoding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> proteins, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> cycle enzymes, and vacuolar ATPase functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the most striking profiles, common among several strains lacking ribosomal protein genes, accumulated lysine and a lysine-related metabolite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the homologous ribosomal protein genes in the human result in Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, demonstrating that metabolite data may have potential value in understanding disease pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach establishes metabolite profiling as capable of characterizing genes in a large collection of genetic variants </plain></SENT>
