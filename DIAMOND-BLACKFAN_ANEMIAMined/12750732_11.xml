<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: A total of 25% of patients presenting with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) carry mutations in the rps19 gene, which encodes protein RPS19 of the small ribosomal subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The other <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cases carry mutations in other, unknown gene(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched mutations in 48 DBA families or isolated patients based on PCR of exons of the rps19 gene and automatic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied three novel intronic polymorphisms in 85 persons (most of the patients and their relatives, when the latter could be investigated) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 10 new mutations within the rps19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no obvious correlation between the clinical expression and the nature of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides, we found three polymorphisms within the rps19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms a, b and c were (i) a one-base insertion (+c at position +79) in intron 2, (ii) the g--&gt;c substitution at position +89 also in intron 2 and (iii) the g--&gt;a substitution at position +14 in intron 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> studies showed that the polymorphisms were transmitted en bloc, thus defining the --- haplotypes (changes absent) and the +++ haplotypes (changes present) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentages of each haplotype were about 50% in families and isolated persons with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, as well as in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the 10 novel mutations found in the rps19 gene, there were no obvious genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The transmission of the polymorphisms was en bloc and the studies did not suggest any clinical correlates at this stage </plain></SENT>
