<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic characterization of Diamond Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) patients and their relatives was performed in 54 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete blood count, fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level, erythrocyte i antigen expression, and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase (eADA) activities were quantitated in patients and relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>eADA was elevated in 28 of 34 transfusion-independent <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, whereas persistence of erythrocyte i antigen was noticed in only 10 of 20 DBA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High eADA activities were also found in 14 of 149 healthy family members, allowing us to identify an isolated high eADA phenotype in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increase in erythrocyte i antigen expression, elevated fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> were much less frequently noted in nonaffected members of the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, isolated high eADA phenotype was found to be significantly associated with genetic markers on chromosome 19 that segregate with the <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated high eADA phenotype thus seems to reflect a silent phenotype of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> in affected families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that elevated eADA activity in unaffected individuals needs to be taken into account during genetic assessment of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> families and could be used for accurate assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
