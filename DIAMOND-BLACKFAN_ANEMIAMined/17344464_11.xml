<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood counts, checked weekly, dropped markedly between weeks 8 and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She rapidly developed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> and was admitted with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (40.9 degrees C), white blood cell count 0.4 x 10(9)/L, absolute neutrophil count 0.1 x 10(9)/L and platelets 114 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was administered broad spectrum antibiotics, G-CSF (10 microgram/kg daily) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> but remained neutropenic and died 6 weeks after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination day 23 revealed areas with low cellularity (around 30%), but also areas with infiltrates of T cells; granulopoiesis and erythropoiesis were scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that weekly neutrophil monitoring is not sufficient to avoid fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that deferiprone not be prescribed to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients unless the clinical indications are particularly strong, and that the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> patients be carefully considered </plain></SENT>
