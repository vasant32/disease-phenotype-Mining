<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that RPS19 expression decreases during terminal erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently no information is available on the subcellular localization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RPS19 and the potential effects of various RPS19 mutations on cellular localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, using <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant RPS19 cDNA, we explored the subcellular distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant proteins in a fibroblast cell line (Cos-7 cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RPS19 was detected primarily in the nucleus, and more specifically in the nucleoli, where RPS19 colocalized with the nucleolar protein nucleolin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs, we identified 2 nucleolar localization signals (NoSs) in RPS19: the first comprising amino acids Met1 to Arg16 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminus and the second comprising Gly120 to Asn142 in the COOH-terminus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, 2 mutations identified in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, Val15Phe and Gly127Gln, each of which localized to 1 of the 2 NoS, failed to localize RPS19 to the nucleolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to their mislocalization, there was a dramatic decrease in the expression of the 2 mutant proteins compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This decrease in protein expression was specific for the mutant RPS19, since expression of other proteins was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present findings enable us to document the nucleolar localization signals in RPS19 and help define the phenotypic consequences of some mutations in RPS19 in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
