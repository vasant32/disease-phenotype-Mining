<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recombinant cytokines were used to investigate the pathophysiology of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) and to treat patients with Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) and amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (AMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) colony growth of six <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients with four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BFU-E showed erythropoietin (Epo) dose dependence in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, although colony numbers were reduced in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number and size of BFU-E were increased with the addition to Epo of interleukin 3 (IL-3) or Steel factor (SF), but IL-3 + SF was not synergistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SF increased the nonadherent cell production in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> long-term bone marrow cultures, and stromal cells from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that SF is not involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, although it may be useful in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A small group of patients with FA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> were treated with daily s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was minimal, and the majority of the patients responded with significant, sustained increase in neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multilineage response was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF may thus be palliative in patients with FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients with AMT were treated with IL-3 or IL-3 followed by GM-CSF in a phase I/II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was minimal toxicity, and IL-3, but not GM-CSF, resulted in improved platelet counts in two patients and decreased platelet transfusion requirements in the other three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prolonged IL-3 treatment resulted in platelet increases in two of the latter patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, IL-3 may contribute to the treatment of patients with AMT </plain></SENT>
