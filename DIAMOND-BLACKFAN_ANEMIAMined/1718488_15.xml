<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No clear explanation has been given of its <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>defective erythropoiesis</z:hpo>, although different humoral or cellular inhibitory factors have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the nature of this defect we studied the effect of several human recombinant growth factors on an enriched CD34+ population obtained from the bone marrow of 10 DBA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed a defect underlying the early erythroid progenitors, which were unresponsive to several growth factors (erythropoietin, interleukin-3 [IL-3], IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], erythroid potentiating activity), either alone or in association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The production of cytokines was not impaired, and high levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF were found in phytohemagglutinin-leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>) when tested with a sensitive biologic assay on the M-07E cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cells in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients may be induced to differentiate to the granulocyte megakaryocyte, but not the erythroid compartment, as shown after CD34+ cell preincubation with IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of the stem cell factor to IL-3 and erythropoietin induces a dramatic in vitro increase in both the number and the size of BFU-E, which also display a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> morphologic terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
