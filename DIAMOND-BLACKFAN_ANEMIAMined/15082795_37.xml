<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is located in the small (40S) subunit and is one of 79 ribosomal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding RPS19 is mutated in approximately 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, which is a rare congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals present with decreased numbers or the absence of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, and associated malformations of various organs are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We produced C57BL/6J mice with a targeted disruption of murine Rps19 to study its role in erythropoiesis and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice homozygous for the disrupted Rps19 were not identified as early as the blastocyst stage, indicating a lethal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, mice heterozygous for the disrupted Rps19 allele have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and organ development, including that of the hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that zygotes which are Rps19(-/-) do not form blastocysts, whereas one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Rps19 allele in C57BL/6J mice is sufficient to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ribosomal and possibly extraribosomal functions </plain></SENT>
