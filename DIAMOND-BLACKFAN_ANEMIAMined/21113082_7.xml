<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC), an inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome (IBMFS), have mutations in telomere biology genes, and very short telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are limited data on intra-individual telomere length (TL) variability in DC and related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured relative TL by quantitative-PCR in blood, buccal cells, and fibroblasts from 21 patients with an IBMFS (5 Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 6 DC, 6 Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and 4 Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As expected, TL in patients with DC was significantly (p&lt;0.01) shorter in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues compared with other IBMFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> disorders combined, the median Q-PCR TL was longer in fibroblast and buccal cells than in blood (overall T/S ratio=1.42 and 1.16 vs. 1.05, p=0.001, 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the absolute values varied, statistically significant intra-individual correlations in TL were present in IBMFS patients: blood and fibroblast (r=0.66, p=0.002), blood and buccal cells (r=0.74, p&lt;0.0001), and fibroblast and buccal cells (r=0.65, p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that relative TL is tissue-independent in DC and possibly in the other IBMFS </plain></SENT>
