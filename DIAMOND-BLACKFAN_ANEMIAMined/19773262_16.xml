<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 40% of patients display various malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> is corrected by steroid treatment in more than 50% of cases; non-responders need <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusions or stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defects in the RPS19 gene, encoding the ribosomal protein S19, are the main known cause of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and account for more than 25% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A described in a minority of patients show that Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two new genes (RPL5, RPL11), encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit, have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In this genotype-phenotype analysis we screened the coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of RPS14, RPS16, RPS24, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> who were negative for RPS19 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: About 20% of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11, and only 1.6% in RPS24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but three mutations that we report here are new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No mutations were found in RPS14, RPS16, or RPL35A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we observed a higher percentage of somatic malformations in patients with RPL5 and RPL11 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A close association was evident between RPL5 mutations and craniofacial malformations, and between hand malformations and RPL11 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in four ribosomal proteins account for around 50% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in Italian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype data suggest that mutation screening should begin with RPL5 and RPL11 in patients with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with malformations </plain></SENT>
