<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detailed ophthalmologic, audiologic, and evoked-potential studies uncovered abnormalities caused by neurotoxicity in 27 more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, with a marked decrease in acuity, loss of color vision, and delayed visual evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five asymptomatic patients had changes in the pigment of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hearing loss was characterized by a high-frequency sensorineural deficit, which necessitated hearing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> was stopped, recovery of vision was complete in 2 patients and partial in 2, and in 22 patients with abnormal audiograms, reversal of the hearing deficit was complete in 4 and partial in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the clinical data showed that members of the affected group were younger, had lower serum ferritin values, and were self-administering higher doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> per kilogram of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> were being taken by patients without abnormalities than by those with visual symptoms, abnormal audiograms, or prolonged evoked potentials (P less than 0.001, less than 0.006, and less than 0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data implicate high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> as a central factor in the pathogenesis of the neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We strongly recommend careful regulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> dosage and serial audiovisual monitoring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving the drug </plain></SENT>
