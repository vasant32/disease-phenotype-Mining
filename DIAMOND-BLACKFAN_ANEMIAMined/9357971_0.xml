<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>Autosomal dominant</z:hpo> and recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> have both been reported, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo>, but most cases occur sporadically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The origin of impaired erythropoiesis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several erythroid growth factors have been thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is neither molecular nor clinical evidence for the involvement of erythropoietin (EPO), its receptor, stem cell factor (SCF), or interleukin (IL)-3, even if the addition of SCF to IL-3 and EPO does significantly increase the growth of erythroid progenitors in in vitro cultures in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work we evaluated the possible role of another early-acting erythroid growth factor, IL-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that the addition of IL-9 to SCF, IL-3, and EPO further increases burst-forming unit-erythroid growth in in vitro cultures of those <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients who responded to SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of the IL-9 gene, we evaluated its segregation in 22 families with members who have <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> by using a polymorphic microsatellite located within its intron 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lod score analysis ruled out any statistically significant involvement of the IL-9 gene in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, linkage analysis with 11 highly polymorphic markers spanning 5q31.1-q33.2 excluded this region, which is included in the major cluster of genes active in hematopoiesis of the human genome </plain></SENT>
