<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Umbilical cord blood is an alternative source of stem cells for allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study is based on data reported to the Eurocord Registry about patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome who underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes were transplanted from related (n = 20) or unrelated donors (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (21 patients), congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (16 patients), <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (8 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> (2 patients), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> (16 patients) and unclassified (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients who received grafts from related donors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but one received an HLA-matched sibling transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median number of total nucleated cells infused was 5 × 10⁷/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at 60 days was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, while the 2-year cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival rate was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients who received grafts from unrelated donors, 86% had HLA-mismatched grafts and three received two umbilical cord blood units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median number of total nucleated cells infused was 6.1 × 10⁷/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 in this group was 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 24%, while the 2-year cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival rate was 61%; better overall survival was associated with age less than 5 years (P = 0.01) and 6.1 × 10⁷/kg or more total nucleated cells infused (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes, related umbilical cord blood transplantation is associated with excellent outcomes while increasing cell dose and better HLA matching might provide better results in unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation </plain></SENT>
