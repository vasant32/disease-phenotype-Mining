<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients poorly responsive to acceptable doses of steroid treatment require long-term transfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have treated three patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> with limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients 1 (DS) and 2 (LS), half-siblings, were 13 and 9 years old, respectively, and remained transfusion independent for many years on steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients manifest steroid-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>, with resultant orthopedic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Oral cyclosporin therapy sufficient to achieve trough serum levels of 100-200 ng/ml was associated with a brisk 50-100% increase in hematocrit within 1 month of initiation of treatment and allowed for a gradual tapering of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dose to approximately 20% of prior established maintenance dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 7-8 months, both patients developed progressive decline in hematocrit level requiring increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dose and, ultimately, transfusion support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient 3 (RD), a 5-year-old child with steroid refractory, transfusion-dependent <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, was entirely unresponsive to cyclosporin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No cyclosporin-associated toxicity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> can transiently ameliorate the hematologic course of some patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are in order to determine its mechanism of action and potential clinical utility in patients unresponsive to acceptable doses of steroid </plain></SENT>
