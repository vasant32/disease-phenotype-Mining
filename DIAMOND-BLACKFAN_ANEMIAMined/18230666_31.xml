<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is emerging as a paradigm for a new class of pathologies potentially linked to disorders in ribosome biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been associated to <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>: after RPS19, mutations in genes RPS24 and RPS17 were recently identified in a fraction of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that cells from patients carrying mutations in RPS24 have defective pre-rRNA maturation, as in the case of RPS19 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to RPS19 involvement in the maturation of the internal transcribed spacer 1, RPS24 is required for processing of the 5' external transcribed spacer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, epistasis experiments with small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> indicate that the functions of RPS19 and RPS24 in pre-rRNA processing are connected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resolution of the crystal structure of RPS24e from the archeon Pyroccocus abyssi reveals domains of RPS24 potentially involved in interactions with pre-ribosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we discuss the impact of RPS24 mutations and speculate that RPS19 and RPS24 cooperate at a particular stage of ribosome biogenesis connected to a cell cycle checkpoint, thus affecting differentiation of erythroid precursors as well as developmental processes </plain></SENT>
