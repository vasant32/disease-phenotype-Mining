<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive database searches revealed SBDS homologues from 159 species, including examples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequenced archaeal and eukaryotic genomes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eukaryotic kingdoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence alignment with ClustalX and MUSCLE algorithms led to the identification of conserved residues that occurred predominantly in the amino-terminal FYSH domain where they appeared to contribute to protein folding or stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only SBDS residue Gly91 was invariant in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four distantly related protists were found to have two divergent SBDS genes in their genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each case, phylogenetic analyses and the identification of shared sequence features suggested that one gene was derived from lateral gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also identified a shared C-terminal zinc finger domain fusion in flowering plants and chromalveolates that may shed light on the function of the protein family and the evolutionary histories of these kingdoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To assess the extent of SBDS functional conservation, we carried out complementation studies of SBDS homologues and interspecies chimeras in Saccharomyces cerevisiae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We determined that the FYSH domain was widely interchangeable among eukaryotes, while domain 2 imparted species specificity to protein function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Domain 3 was largely dispensable for function in our yeast complementation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the phylogeny of SBDS was shared with a group of proteins that were markedly enriched for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> metabolism and/or ribosome-associated functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings link <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> to other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes with defects in nucleolus-associated processes, including Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, cartilage-hair <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita </plain></SENT>
