<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of cases are associated with other congenital defects, particularly malformations of the upper limb or craniofacial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene coding for the ribosomal protein RPS19 have been identified in 25% of patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, with resulting impairment of 18S rRNA processing and 40S ribosomal subunit formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, mutations in other ribosomal protein coding genes account for about 25% of other <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, the analysis of mice from which the gene coding for the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> exporter Feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Virus subgroup C Receptor (FLVCR1) is deleted suggested that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FLVCR1-null mice show a phenotype resembling that of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, including erythroid failure and malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients have disease linkage to chromosome 1q31, where FLVCR1 is mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been reported that cells from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients express alternatively spliced isoforms of FLVCR1 which encode non-functional proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Herein, we review the known roles of RPS19 and FLVCR1 in ribosome function and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> metabolism respectively, and discuss how the deficiency of a ribosomal protein or of a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> exporter may result in the same phenotype </plain></SENT>
