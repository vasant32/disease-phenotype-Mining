<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is a congenital red blood cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> that is usually diagnosed during early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from defects in red blood cell maturation, the disorder is also associated with various physical anomalies in 40% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 are found in 25% of patients, while mutations in other proteins of the small ribosomal subunit--RPS17 and RPS24--have been found in a fraction of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35a of the large ribosomal subunit have also been reported in several <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the identification of mutations in the RPL5 and RPL11 genes in patients from the Czech <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in RPL5 were identified in eight patients from 6 out of 28 families (21.4%), and mutations in RPL11 in two patients from 2 out of 28 families (7.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients with either an RPL5 or RPL11 mutation exhibited one or more physical anomalies; specifically, thumb anomalies (flat thenar) were always present, while no such anomaly was observed in seven patients with an RPS19 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 9 out of 10 patients with either an RPL5 or RPL11 mutation were born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> (SGA) compared to 3 out of 7 patients from the RPS19-mutated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations may suggest that mutations, at least in RPL5, seem to generally have more profound impact on fetal development than mutations in RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since RPL5 and RPL11, together with RPL23, are also involved in the MDM2-mediated p53 pathway regulation, we also screened the RPL23 gene for mutations; however, no mutations were identified </plain></SENT>
