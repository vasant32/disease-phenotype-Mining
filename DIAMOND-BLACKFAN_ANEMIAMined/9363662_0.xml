<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 4-month-old Japanese infant girl with Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) as shown by congenital macrocytic pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> with marked reduction of erythroid precursors in bone marrow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo>, increased fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, and elevated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase activity in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She responded poorly to conventional doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, however, with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> she responded with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001923'>reticulocytosis</z:hpo> and an elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level above 12 g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythrophagocytosis was noted during the tapering period of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> when her <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level declined to 7.6 g/dL and reticulocyte level to 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At that time, the erythrophagocytosis was noted in about 60% of marrow histiocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were not observed prior to or during the high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We speculate that one of the causes of pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> is mediated by erythrophagocytosis </plain></SENT>
