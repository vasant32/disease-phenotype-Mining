The etiology of Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) is not yet clear. A small part of TGA has a familiar occurrence. We report a case of recurrent, long-lasting familiar amnesia occurring after betablocker treatment withdrawal in a migrainous patient. We suggest that familiar TGA could be caused by the mechanism of vasospasm rather than venous congestion and that the abnormal cerebral vasomotor control could be the hereditary substrate in this condition.
