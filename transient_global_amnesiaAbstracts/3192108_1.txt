Transient global amnesia is described in two patients suffering from classical and common migraine, respectively. These cases are peculiar in that the amnesic attack was part of the aura in one patient, while it behaved like an accompanying symptom in the other. The close temporal relation between the attacks of transient global amnesia and migraine strengthens the hypothesis of an etiologic role of migraine. The nature of this mechanism could be the cerebral blood flow changes or the neural perturbation which characterize migraine attacks.
