Transient global amnesia (TGA) is the abrupt onset of temporary anterograde amnesia without any focal neurological features. It is a benign condition and is completely reversible in most cases. However, the sudden occurrence of memory impairment can be especially alarming to an individual who has recently arrived in an unfamiliar setting. The cause of TGA remains unknown. Reported here is the unusual occurrence of TGA in a man following the completion of an international airplane flight. Possible etiologies of the episode are considered.
