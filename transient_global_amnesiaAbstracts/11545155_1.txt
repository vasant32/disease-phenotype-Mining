A patient who had experienced an attack of transient global amnesia (TGA) was examined using neurophysiological methods. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was performed and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) test was administered at 5 days and at more than a month after the TGA episode. MEG data on neuronal activity obtained while the patient was undertaking a working memory task and during rest were analyzed using the wavelet-crosscorrelation method, which reveals time-lag and information flow between related sites in the brain. The WMS-R memory scores showed dramatic improvement when the test was administered a month following the attack, although no significant changes were observed in EEG, MRI and SPECT data. The MEG study revealed that under a working memory load how the neuron works functionally and the information propagates assembly within the right hemisphere, and that these brain functions were not performed adequately shortly after the TGA attack.
