We examined by neuropsychological tests 41 patients who had presented attacks of transient global amnesia (TGA; 31 had single and 10 multiple episodes), comparing them with 41 matched normal controls. Patients with single attacks showed only two impaired memory tasks with respect to controls (immediate and long-term verbal memory), while patients with multiple attacks showed more impaired tasks in memory and visuoperceptual ability. These data confirm that TGA is a benign syndrome, but could leave a few subclinical memory deficits probably exacerbated by repeated attacks.
