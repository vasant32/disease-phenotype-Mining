A 53-year-old female patient presented with sudden onset confusion and disorientation. Further neurological examination was unremarkable and the patient showed a complete recovery after several hours. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination performed 2Â days later revealed a tiny focal lesion in the lateral hippocampus in the diffusion weighted images consistent with transient global amnesia.
