In children and young adults migraine attacks can be triggered by mild head injury. The literature on this syndrome was surveyed and 50 case reports found to meet the latest criteria of classification requiring at least two similar attacks for diagnosis of migraine (except for common migraine which was excluded from review). 33 subjects had at least one trauma-triggered attack and one identical or similar spontaneous attack, 17 cases at least two similar or identical trauma triggered attacks. An analysis of all cases showed the following features: The symptoms of migraine mostly start with a latency between one and thirty minutes after the injury and dissolve within one day. First attacks without mention of headache were mainly found in children younger than 8 years. Trauma-triggered migraine attacks are well documented for familial hemiplegic migraine, migraine attacks with hemispheric symptoms and attacks with disturbances of consciousness, while the view that posttraumatic transient cortical blindness and transient global amnesia are migraine attacks is insufficiently supported. A hereditary predisposition for a traumatic trigger mechanism seems to be present at least in familial hemiplegic migraine. Nosologic relations to syndromes of secondary neurological deterioration after mild head injury in childhood are discussed.
