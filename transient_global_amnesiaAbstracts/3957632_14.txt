An extensive neuropsychological study was made during an attack of transient global amnesia and during four follow-up. The neuropsychological findings are compared to those of previous reports. Transient global amnesia appears to be a relatively benign syndrome but it leaves some "fragility" of memory, detected by complex neuropsychological tasks.
