 PURPOSE: Patients with transient global amnesia (TGA) present with a characteristic clinical syndrome although other differential diagnoses have to be considered. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) represents a highly specific diagnostic tool in the context of TGA; however, standard clinical DWI often fails to detect the small characteristic hippocampal lesions. The diagnostic success of DWI sequences in TGA patients was analyzed with respect to slice thickness and time interval between symptom onset. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of 198 patients with clinically diagnosed TGA were retrospectively analyzed. All DWI studies were grouped according to the slice thickness applied (3 mm, 5 mm and 6 mm). The three groups were assessed for group-specific detection rates of hippocampal lesions with diffusion restriction. In addition the detection rates were evaluated with respect to the time interval between TGA symptom onset and MRI examination. RESULTS: A significant increase in detection rates (about 8.4% per mm) was found when thinner slices were acquired (44.7% for 3 mm, 27.1% for 5 mm and 19.6% for 6 mm slice thickness). The detection rate was highest (up to 80%) when MRI was performed 2 days after TGA symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: The MRI protocol in patients with TGA should include a DWI sequence with a slice thickness of 3 mm or less. The examination should be performed on day 2 after symptom onset to fully exploit the diagnostic value of DWI which represents a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for patients with TGA.
