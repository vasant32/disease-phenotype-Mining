Subclinical rhythmic electrographic discharges of adults (SREDA) is an uncommon distinctive EEG rhythmic pattern with uncertain significance. We report a patient with transient global amnesia in whom an EEG recording, performed after the acute phase of the neurological event, showed SREDA. Based on this EEG finding, we discuss about a possible correlation between SREDA and transient global amnesia. The presence of SREDA in our patient with transient global amnesia seems to be incidental. When described in association with transient global amnesia, SREDA should be recognized in order to avoid misdiagnosis. Although SREDA has been fortuitously described in association with transient global amnesia, a patho-physiological correlation with mechanisms which produce it seems unlikely.
