We prospectively identified patients with transient global amnesia in an urban population of 163,000. In 1982, 16 patients experienced their first transient global amnesia. The annual incidence rate was 10 per 100,000 population, and 32 per 100,000 among those aged 50 years or older. There was a substantial female predominance in the incidence of transient global amnesia.
