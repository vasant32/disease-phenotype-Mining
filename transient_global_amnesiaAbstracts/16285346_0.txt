BACKGROUND: Transient global amnesia presents as paroxysmal, transient loss of memory function and has been shown to have a number of inciting factors. AIMS: To report a case and its inciting factor in order to heighten awareness of the condition. METHODS: A 56-year-old woman who presented with TGA after sexual intercourse is reported. RESULTS: The episode of TGA resolved after 14 hours. Results of laboratory tests including MRI brain and MR angiogram and venogram were normal. CONCLUSION: An inciting event can often be identified for TGA and a targeted history should be used to help elicit such events.
