 INTRODUCTION: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is one of the most striking syndromes in clinical neurology. Brain lesions producing TGA have been reported in the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and neocortex. CASE REPORT: We report a 63-year-old woman presenting with TGA associated with a localized lesion in the left putamen. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests a potential role of the putamen in human memory processing.
