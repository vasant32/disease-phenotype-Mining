It is not unusual for doctors working in the emergency department (ED) to diagnose a benign syndrome of transient global amnesia (TGA). It is rare that the TGA patient is in danger of life because of a 'forgotten' acute aortic dissection (AAD). The present article deals with one of such rare cases of association between TGA and AAD, which presented laboratory findings never reported before. A practical diagnostic algorithm has also been drafted to help ED physicians facing such a puzzling situation.
