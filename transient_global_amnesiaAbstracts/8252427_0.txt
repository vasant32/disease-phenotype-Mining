Transient global amnesia is an unusual neurologic phenomenon that occasionally occurs after angiography, usually of the cerebral vessels. It represents a benign event, and normal function is ultimately restored, but the amnesia may be frightening for both the patient and the physician until its nature is recognized. The authors describe two cases of transient global amnesia occurring after cerebral angiography with iohexol, outline the criteria for the diagnosis and discuss the proposed mechanism of the phenomenon.
