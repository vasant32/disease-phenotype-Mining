In seven entirely healthy children in the age group of 6.5 to 14.5 years, mild head injury produced transient global amnesia (TGA) of median duration of 4.5 hours. None of the patients had convincing signs of brain concussion or clinical focal symptomatology. In four cases CT examination of the brain showed normal findings. Four children had a transient abnormal EEG (intermittent delta rhythms, slowed background activity inconstant local finding (of slow waves). During the period monitored (2-34 months) there was no recurrent attack and the children have had no difficulties. Pathologically, the authors assume ischemia of temporobasal structures induced by mild trauma with a relationship to migraine diathesis and rank the child group among so called benign posttraumatic encephalopathy with a noncomplicated course and good outcome.
