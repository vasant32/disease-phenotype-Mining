A so-called conscious post-traumatic twilight state ("besonnener DÃ¤mmerzustand") after a whiplash injury is described here, showing up its similarities with a classic post-traumatic conscious twilight state on the one hand and a classic transient global amnesia on the other hand. The term "conscious twilight state" is analysed and found inappropriate for the state it is meant to describe, and hence the term "post-traumatic transient global amnesia" is proposed instead. A post-traumatic transient global amnesia after whiplash injury is considered to be caused by a concussion.
