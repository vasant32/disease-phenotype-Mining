A 68-year-old female presented with recurrent transient global amnesia due to hemorrhagic prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly revealed the anatomical relationship between the hematoma, within the parasellar tumor, and the compressed medial temporal lobe of the right (non-dominant) hemisphere. Within 4 weeks after the start of bromocriptin administration, the adenoma had markedly regressed and the affected temporal lobe was decompressed. She has experienced no further episode of transient global amnesia. Magnetic resonance imaging is recommended to detect latent organic lesions responsible for transient global amnesia, although the disorder is considered to be benign and of functional origin.
