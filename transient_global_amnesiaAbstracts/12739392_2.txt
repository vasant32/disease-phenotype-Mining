We here reported a case of typical transient global amnesia (TGA). A 64-year-old right-handed man was suddenly unable to keep his recent memory without any event. There were no neurological deficits except for recent memory disturbances. He showed no causative findings of the attack on examinations of laboratory data, EEG and MRI. Examination of single photon emission CT (SPECT), using 99mTc-ECD, was performed in acute and chronic stages. We were able to detect bilateral hippocampal hypoperfusion in the acute stage using a new analyzing system, easy Z-score Imaging System (eZIS). It showed extensive hypoperfusion also in the vertebrobasilar artery territory. Twenty-seven days later, these findings disappeared. Using this system, we are able to evaluate cerebral blood flow objective with anatomical information by SPECT. Therefore, we concluded that this analyzing system would be helpful to reveal the pathophysiological mechanism of TGA.
