We report the clinical and EEG study of three migraine patients who presented with peculiar clinical phenomena related to migraine attack. The first case is a transient global amnesia that followed a classic migraine status. The second is a confusional state that complicated a classic migraine attack. The third is a complex attack with combined features of migraine and epilepsy.
