A patient had neuropsychological testing during, and at two days and seven weeks after a transient global amnesia (TGA) attack. During the attack she exhibited a characteristically profound anterograde amnesia but a limited remote memory loss; the most striking impairment was a deficit in personal episodic memory revealed by her performance on the Autobiographical Memory Interview. Personal and general semantic information was less impaired although there were indications of a temporal gradient in the impairment. When tested after the attack, she demonstrated normal anterograde and retrograde memory. A SPECT scan performed during TGA showed a focal reduction in cerebral perfusion in the postero-medial temporal lobes bilaterally which had resolved after seven weeks.
