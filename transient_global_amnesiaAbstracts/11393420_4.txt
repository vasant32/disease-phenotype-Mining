We report a case of neurosyphilis with transient global amnesia (TGA)-like attacks on the first presentation. MRI abnormalities in bilateral limbic systems, including a few lesions in the basal ganglia and thalamus, were identified. Depression and dementia became apparent, accompanied by a high treponemal antibody titer and mild cortical atrophy. Antisyphilitic therapy brought about mild improvement, and the MRI abnormalities decreased.
