A left rostral thalamic hematoma was found in a 52-year-old hypertensive man who suffered from a 10-h episode of transient global amnesia (TGA). A neuropsychological study revealed no cognitive impairment in a follow-up period for 5 years. The left rostral part of the thalamus appears to be responsible for his TGA, due probably to an interference of the mamillothalamic tract, ventroamygdalofugal pathway or dorsal noradrenergic bundle.
