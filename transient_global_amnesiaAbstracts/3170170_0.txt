Transient global amnesia (TGA) was formerly supposed to have an epileptic origin thought unlikely by more recent authors. Further, epileptic seizures rarely present transient memory dysfunction as prominent symptom. These particular cases of which we report here three examples were previously identified as epileptic amnesic attacks (EAA). They have uniform clinical characteristics quite different from TGA and respond favorably to antiepileptic therapy. The features differentiating these two conditions are discussed. The authors suggest that an epileptic origin should be considered in patients presenting frequent transient amnesic attacks.
