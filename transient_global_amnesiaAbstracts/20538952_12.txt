A critical role in place learning has been attributed to place cells within the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) sector of the hippocampus in rodents. The role of CA1 cells in the human hippocampus with regard to place learning remains elusive. Using a virtual Morris water maze, we investigated patients with acute transient global amnesia (TGA), a rare self-limiting dysfunction of the hippocampal system. Fourteen individuals with selective and focal lesions in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus showed a profound impairment in place learning. The size of the lesions and the duration of the TGA correlated with the deficit in the performance.
