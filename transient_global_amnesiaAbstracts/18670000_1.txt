BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown the presence of psychopathological disorders in transient global amnesia. AIMS: To determine whether transient global amnesia is associated with psychopathological disorders and to assess the influence of these psychopathological disorders on memory impairments. METHOD: Levels of anxiety and depression before and during transient global amnesia were rated. Memory performances were assessed by means of original episodic memory tasks and working memory tasks. These data were collected in 17 individuals observed during the very acute phase, 18 individuals examined in the peri-acute phase and 26 controls. RESULTS: During the acute phase, participants with transient global amnesia displayed a higher level of anxiety and a more depressed mood than controls. An alteration of emotional state, as measured by the Adjective Mood Scale, was correlated with deficits in anterograde memory. CONCLUSIONS: Transient global amnesia comprises sudden changes in people's emotional state, which has a major impact on and interacts with episodic memory impairment.
