There is uncertainty about the etiology of transient global amnesia and none of the pathogenetic hypotheses proposed so far, i.e. transient ischemia, epileptic discharge and spreading depression of cortical electrical activity, is completely satisfactory. Using water suppressed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy we studied one patient during a typical episode of transient global amnesia and 2 weeks thereafter in order to investigate the metabolic changes in the hippocampal region. In both hippocampi, spectra of N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine-phosphocreatine, compounds containing choline and lactate failed to show changes consistent with cerebral ischemia, both in the acute phase and in the follow-up. Spreading depression in response to emotional stress seems a likely explanation in this patient, who suffered from migraine in the past.
