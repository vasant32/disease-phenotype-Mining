Transient global amnesia is a benign, self-limiting disorder primarily involving a disturbance of memory. It occurs in late middle and older aged adults. Patients with this syndrome do not have a history of head trauma, drug or alcohol intoxication, hypoglycemia or psychologic dysfunction. Once the episode has cleared, there are no residual deficits except amnesia for the events which occurred during the episode. This article includes a case presentation in addition to discussion of the clinical features, etiology, treatment and nursing interventions for the patient with a transient global amnesia episode.
