In 13 patients who experienced transient global amnesia (TGA), quantified electroencephalographic (qEEG) records were carried out within 1 week of the episodes, and compared with those in 13 cases with cerebral transient ischemic attacks (TIA), and 13 normal controls, matched for age and sex. A statistical comparison of the absolute power showed few differences between TGA and TIA patients, and many statistical differences between TGA patients and controls. The qEEG pattern reveals an involvement of the temporo-parietal structures in TGA patients. These findings suggest the presence of subclinical sequelae, after the TGA attack.
