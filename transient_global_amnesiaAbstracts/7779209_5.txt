Acute confusional migraine in children and transient global amnesia in adults share a number of similar clinical manifestations. Acute confusional migraine in 6 children (mean age: 11.7 years; range: 7.5-17 years) was characterized by transient episodes of amnesia and acute confusion lasting 1-12 hours. Episodes were preceded by headache and vomiting in 4 patients. In 2 patients acute confusional migraine was the initial symptom. A history of preceding trivial head injury was reported in 3 patients and migraine in 4. Urine and serum drug screens were negative. Cerebral imaging studies and interictal electroencephalograms were normal. Ictal electroencephalograms in 3 patients revealed diffuse or bioccipital delta wave slowing. Recurrent episodes of acute confusional migraine occurred in 2 children during 1-3 years of follow-up. The clinical manifestations of acute confusional migraine in this series of children are similar to those reported in transient global amnesia. The similarity of the clinical manifestations of acute confusional migraine in children and transient global amnesia in adults suggests that these disorders may share a common pathophysiology.
