The cause of transient global amnesia (TGA) remains controversial. Focal cerebral ischemia, seizure, venous congestion, and migraine have all been proposed as underlying mechanisms. We describe a patient presenting with typical TGA who two days later developed a posterior circulation stroke due to basilar artery occlusion. He was treated successfully with intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy. Shortly thereafter, he had recurrent basilar artery thrombosis and jugular vein thrombosis, and was found to have a mucinous adenocarcinoma believed to be causing a hypercoagulable state. We believe this case supports the hypothesis that TGA can on occasion be caused by cerebral ischemia.
