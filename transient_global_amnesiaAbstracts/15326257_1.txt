To assess whether platelets are activated in transient global amnesia (TGA) and TIA, blood samples were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cytoscan using antibodies specific for platelet fibrinogen receptor (PAC1) and P-selectin (CD62P). Samples from TIA contained high levels of CD62P compared with age-matched control subjects, whereas those from TGA did not. The authors suggest that activated platelets are involved in brain ischemia, whereas ischemia appears not to be associated with most TGA.
