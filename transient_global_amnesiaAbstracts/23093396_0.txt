 HISTORY: A 69-year-old female patient who had been physically and mentally healthy was admitted to our emergency department because of acute onset of amnesia. INVESTIGATIONS: Inconspicuous diagnostic findings led to the diagnosis of transient global amnesia (TGA). Furthermore bradycardia and elevated troponins were detected. Because of these findings a cardiologic workup was performed resulting in the diagnosis of Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The patient recovered completely from TGA as well as from the slight reduction of the left-ventricular ejection fraction as part of the Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSION: There are similarities of the two diseases Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy and TGA concerning triggers as well as reversibility. Patients presenting with symptoms suggestive for TGA should be considered to undergo additional cardiologic evaluation.
