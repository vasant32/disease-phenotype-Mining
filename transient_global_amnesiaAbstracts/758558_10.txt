Transient global amnesia (TGA) is generally believed to be a transient ischemic attack affecting short-term memory centers. A recent three-year follow-up found a high incidence of subsequent dementia and stroke in patients with TGA. We studied the course (average, 46 months) of 32 patients with TGA and found a low rate of recurrence (12.5%), dementia (6%), or transient ischemic attacks (3%). Transient global amnesia would appear to carry a more benign prognosis than classical transient ischemic attacks.
