This is a description of a previously healthy female who developed a memory deficit after running a 21-km race for the first time in her life. The memory problem lasted a few hours, during which time she was anxious, asking the same questions repeatedly. The effects of exercise on memory are discussed. Transient global amnesia, its associations and prognosis, is reviewed.
