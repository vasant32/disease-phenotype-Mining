A 58-year-old female underwent PVC ablation within the right coronary cusp for symptomatic PVCs and suspected PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. Immediately after the procedure, she started to complain about feelings of impending doom, disorientation to time and place, and amnesia regarding the procedure. No sensory or motor deficits could be elicited. A thromboembolic event was suspected and she was evaluated by a neurologist. CT scan of her brain was negative. She was diagnosed with transient global amnesia and her mentation returned to baseline within 4 hours after the procedure.
