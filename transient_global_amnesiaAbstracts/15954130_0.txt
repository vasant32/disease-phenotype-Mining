We report on the case of a 69-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease and long-standing history of spasmodic dysphonia that reversed during an episode of transient global amnesia (TGA). To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported before. We suggest possible mechanisms by which the pathophysiology of dystonia could reverse during TGA.
