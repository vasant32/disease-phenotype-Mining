A 59-year-old hypertensive patient presented with transient global amnesia without neurological signs or symptoms. During the following 3 years, he experienced several attacks of vertebrobasilar insufficiency and a cerebellar infarction. CT scan and MRI found a partially thrombosed dolichoectatic basilar artery but no significant lesion within the limbic system. These data suggest transient global amnesia was due to a transient ischemia in the basilar artery distribution.
