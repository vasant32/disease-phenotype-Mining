BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stroke care in Germany has substantially improved during the last decade. One column of modern stroke care is the institution of stroke unit which allows rapid diagnosis and treatment. The aspect of admission of nonstroke patients to a stroke unit is poorly evaluated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the number of patients who are admitted to a national stroke unit but do not suffer from stroke. Furthermore, we related the proportion of nonstroke referrals to the different referral modes. PATIENT AND METHODS: Observational study recording all suspected stroke referrals with regard to final diagnosis and type of referral during a 12-month period (1.8.2002-31.7.2003). RESULTS: 462 patients were admitted by 4 routes: 74 by paramedics or by self-presentation, 138 by emergency physicians, 144 by primary care doctors, and 106 were transferred from other hospitals. 88 patients (19 %) finally revealed no acute stroke. The most common nonstroke diagnoses were seizure (20 %), dissociative disorders (14 %), cranial nerve disorders (11 %), hypoglycaemia (8 %) and transient global amnesia (7 %). There was no significant difference among the proportion of nonstroke patients referred by ambulance paramedics and self-presentation (15 %), emergency physicians (21 %), primary care doctors (15 %) and interhospital transfer (24 %) [p = 0.222, X (2)-test according to Pearson]. CONCLUSION: Due to the fact that a number of clinical neurological conditions mimic acute stroke, misdiagnosis of stroke is common. We advocate that all stroke patients are seen early in the course of the disease by a neurologist. An alternative could be that in stroke units of internal medicine hospitals patients are seen by a consulting neurologist. Alternatively, telemedicine might be used and the neurologist on duty of a neurological stroke unit could be consulted.
