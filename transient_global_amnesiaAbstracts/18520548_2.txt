We report a 64-year-old male patient with pure transient global amnesia (TGA) who exhibited global cerebral hypoperfusion during an amnesia attack. Initial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed 3 hours after the onset of the amnesic attack revealed diffuse hypoperfusion in the cerebrum, whereas a second SPECT study, 1 month later, revealed improvement of cerebral blood flow. This case suggests that SPECT study is useful in revealing the pathophysiological mechanism of TGA and that TGA attacks are associated with global cerebral blood flow change.
