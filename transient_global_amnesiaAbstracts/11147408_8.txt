Previous functional neuroimaging studies performed during transient global amnesia (TGA) have not answered the central question regarding the etiology of TGA, namely: whether the observed hypoperfusion in the mesial temporal lobe structures reflects a primarily ischemic process or whether it represents a secondary phenomenon resulting from locally decreased metabolism. The authors performed Tc 99-m-bicisate brain single photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning in a 66-year-old man during an episode of TGA, 24 hours after the episode and 3 months after the episode. To the authors' knowledge, this is the only reported study in which a follow-up SPECT scan was performed within 24 hours. The initial study showed bilateral mesial temporal lobe hypoperfusion that partially resolved after 24 hours and returned to normal at 3 months. Resolution of the SPECT scan abnormalities correlated well with resolution of the memory loss. These findings agree with previously reported SPECT, positron-emission tomography (PET), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies that indicate the mesial temporal lobe structures as the major site of pathology in TGA. The authors suggest that a process causing decreased local metabolism, such as cortical spreading depression, constitutes the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in this case.
