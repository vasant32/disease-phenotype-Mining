In comparison with 27 similar cases, sampled from literature, 4 observations of amnesic episodes in migraine are presented and discussed. These disturbances known as so-called "Migranedammerattacken" seem to be identical with transient global amnesia in all respects. In most of cases, they occur as migraine-precursors or - equivalents. Headache, vegetative und neurological symptoms are frequent but not necessary companions. It is proposed to look for migraine disposition in all cases of transient global amnesia. Perhaps, this approach might be of some use to understand their enigmatic pathogenesis.
