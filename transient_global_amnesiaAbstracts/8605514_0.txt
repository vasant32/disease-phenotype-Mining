Transient global amnesia refers to a sudden and isolated dysfunction of memory for recent events, lasting a few hours. The pathogenesis of this neurological disorder is still uncertain. The most accepted hypotheses concern ischaemic, epileptic and migraine causes. We now report a case of transient global amnesia associated with computed tomography evidence for a hypodense area in the left thalamus 10 days after the transient memory dysfunctions.
