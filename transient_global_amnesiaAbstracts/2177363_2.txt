Transient global amnesia is a self-limited disorder and is regarded as a benign syndrome of vascular etiology. We described a 65-year-old woman who experienced a single episode of transient global amnesia and subsequently developed a right hemispheric syndrome and permanent loss of recent memory. Neuroradiologic investigations and surgical operations revealed a right sphenoid ridge meningioma. Although the syndrome is most often benign, the possibility of mass lesion should be carefully assessed.
