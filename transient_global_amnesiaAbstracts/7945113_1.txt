Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an uncommon syndrome of recent memory deficit and inability to learn new data, usually resolving within 24 h. Two cases following use of non-ionic contrast media in cerebral angiography are described. The neuroanatomy of memory is reviewed. Possible aetiologies of TGA in relation to cerebral angiography include ischaemia (embolic, arterial spasm), epilepsy that may be primary or tumour-related and direct toxic effects of contrast media.
