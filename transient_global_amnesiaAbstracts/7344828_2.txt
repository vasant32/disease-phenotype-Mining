This paper presents electroencephalographic evidence of bilateral independent temporal lobe spiking during an episode of transient global amnesia. The amnesia occurred during a period of hypotension secondary to sinus bradycardia. The amnesia recurred in absence of bradycardia and hypotension. The temporal lobe spiking leads credence to the thought that transient global amnesia occurs as the result of seizure activity.
