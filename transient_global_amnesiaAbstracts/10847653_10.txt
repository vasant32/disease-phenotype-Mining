This report describes single photon emission tomography (SPECT) evidence of transient, relative hypoperfusion of the right basal ganglia and left temporal lobe in a 60-year-old man studied during the acute phase of classical transient global amnesia (TGA). The findings are interpreted in the light of previous reports indicating that involvement of the right hemisphere or both cerebral hemispheres consistently predicts severe retrograde amnesia, in addition to the typical loss of anterograde memory observed during TGA. These deficits involving the right hemisphere and left temporal lobe may reflect disruption of circuits mediating episodic memory retrieval and memory encoding, respectively.
