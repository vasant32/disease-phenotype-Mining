INTRODUCTION: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a disorder of unknown aetiology. In recent studies, TGA was associated with a right to left shunt (RLS). We studied the presence of the RLS in patients with TGA and we compared this series with patients who had suffered a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 66 consecutive TGA patients. In these patients a transcranial Doppler was performed to determine the presence of a RLS. We collected data on the TGA episode, vascular risk factors, migraine history, recurrence of TGA and neuroimaging in patients with and without RLS. We compared the prevalence of the RLS in TGA series with 59 patients with TIA. RESULTS: The prevalence of RLS was 21.2% in patients with TGA. The RLS was associated with the migraine history (40% versus 13%; p = 0.014) and a Valsalva manoeuvre as a triggering factor (50% versus 14.5%; p = 0.022). A greater prevalence of RLS was detected in patients with TIA (55.9% versus 21.2%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The RLS prevalence in TGA patients is similar to the general population but significantly lower than the prevalence in TIA patients. The association with a Valsalva manoeuvre as a precipitating factor in the TGA patients with RLS could play a role in the aetiopathogenesis of the TGA.
