Transient global amnesia has been reported to be precipitated by intense emotion in adult patients. Transient global amnesia is uncommon in the pediatric age group. We report the unusual occurrence of this syndrome, apparently precipitated on two occasions by emotion, in an adolescent who had earlier in life suffered a left temporal and occipital lobe embolic infarction from congenital heart disease. Transient global amnesia following intense emotion may be a cause of some confusional states in children and adolescents.
