Cases of transient global amnesia (TGA) seen by one consultant neurologist over a 4-year period (2002-2005 inclusive) were identified. Of 10 possible cases, eight fulfilled suggested diagnostic criteria. Five cases were seen as ward consultations, three in outpatient clinics; seven were seen in district general hospitals. Six of the eight cases had already been seen by hospital physicians, whose working diagnoses included stroke/TIA and epilepsy. In some cases, this had resulted in inappropriate investigation, treatment and advice. Although rare, TGA is a diagnosis both hospital physicians and general practitioners need to be aware of in order to avoid potential pitfalls. The critical importance of collateral history in reaching the diagnosis is emphasised.
