Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography is a useful and relatively safe test for coronary artery disease assessment. However, possible complications should be recognized. We describe a case of transient global amnesia in a woman who underwent a standard-protocol dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiogram for coronary ischaemia detection, after having complained about chest pain. The test was not positive for coronary ischaemia, but a typical picture of transient global amnesia ensued. Symptoms shortly resolved spontaneously. Neurological work up was negative for organic disease. Transient global amnesia is a neurological syndrome of unknown origin and good prognosis. Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography can be added to the described precipitants of transient global amnesia. This neurological syndrome should be taken into account as a possible complication of dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography.
