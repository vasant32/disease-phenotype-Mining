The EEG findings from 30 patients with transient global amnesia (TGA) of vascular origin are described. A pathological result was seen in 18 cases, from which 17 had predominantly focal changes. 12 EEG's were normal. With increasing time interval between the TGA and the EEG investigation a normal record was slightly commoner. 20 patients had CT results, of which 8 cases were pathological. In 12 cases the EEG and CT results were correspondingly pathological or normal. The EEG shows functional disturbances even after the neurological deficits have resolved, which are related to transient metabolic or diminished blood-flow disturbances, but do not result in structural lesions to bae seen in the CT.
