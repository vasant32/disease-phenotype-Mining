A 60-year-old patient had a 3-year history of recurrent memory disturbances. The video electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of one attack showed that the amnesic state, which clinically resembled transient global amnesia, was characterized by a normal EEG tracing followed by electroclinical complex partial seizures. We suggest that "epileptic" transient global amnesia is postictal in nature.
