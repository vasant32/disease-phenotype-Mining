A patient in whom transient global amnesia (TGA) led to the diagnosis of an ethmoidal meningioma is described. One year after neurosurgery, the patient showed an impairment of long-term memory, without any clinical or neuroradiological sign of relapse. We suggest that TGA may express a preexisting subclinical impairment of memory neuronal systems.
