A student pilot is referred for evaluation of a "head injury with post-traumatic amnesia." The case study presents a temporal association of injury and symptoms that were assumed to be related. A differential diagnosis of an amnestic syndrome is presented. Transient global amnesia is discussed as a possible etiology until an EEG revealed an epileptiform abnormality. The aeromedical implications, military and FAA, of the clinical and electrophysiologic findings are discussed.
