INTRODUCTION: Transient global amnesia (TGA) is defined as a selective, or almost selective, deficit of the memory that appears suddenly and lasts less than 24 hours. The aetiopathogenesis of this syndrome remains unknown and different theories have been put forward about its epileptic or ischemic origin, or the relationship that exists with the neuronal depression that is produced in migraine. A number of triggering factors have been described, including the taking of distinct pharmaceutical preparations. CASE REPORT: We report the cases of two patients with a history of migraines who suffered TGA after taking ergotamine and dihydroergotamine, respectively, to treat an attack of migraine. CONCLUSIONS: Given the vasoconstriction effect of these drugs, it was concluded that in both cases the main factor that triggered the TGA was the ingestion of ergots.
