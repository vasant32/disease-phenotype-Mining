In this case report and review of the literature, transient global amnesia (TGA) is discussed. A 72-year-old physician presented to the emergency department with sudden loss of memory. In particular, he was unable to recall recent events. Other neurological examination was intact. The loss of recent memory was completely resolved, during the next 4 hours. This event (TGA) must be distinguished from other neurological events such as transient ischemic attacks, seizures, and cerebral vascular events. A literature review suggested that TGA is related to an acute loss of function in the temporal lobe. It is important for palliative medicine physicians to have this unusual syndrome in their differential diagnosis, as this cause of memory loss must be separated from more aggressive causes of memory loss, for example, stroke and seizure. Transient global amnesia is a self-limiting disorder without late consequences.
