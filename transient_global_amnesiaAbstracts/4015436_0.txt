The clinical picture and investigation of 26 patients (16 males and 10 females) with diagnosis of transient global amnesia (TGA) are reported. Age ranged from 51 to 78 years at the time of TGA, which occurred mor often between 60 and 70 year-old people. Three patients presented more than one episode (3, 4 and 5). Precipitating factors were identified in 8 cases (emotional stress in 7 and physical exercise in 1). Risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were found in 13 cases, mainly hypertension (9 cases) and diabetes (3 cases). EEG was normal in 20 cases and disclosed diffuse delta waves in 2, temporal delta waves in 1 and temporal theta waves in another patient. CAT scan showed no abnormalities in 3 cases and ischemia in the vertebro-basilar system in another 2. Brain angiography was normal in 1 case and showed abnormalities in the vertebro-basilar system arteries in 3. During the follow-up period, which ranged from 1 to 84 months, no neurologic deterioration was seen. The role of risk factors for vascular diseases, epilepsy and migraine in the development of TGA is discussed.
