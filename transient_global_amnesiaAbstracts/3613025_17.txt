Three neuroscientists traveled on different occasions from New York to Europe to attend scientific meetings. In an attempt to minimize "jet lag," they all took triazolam, 0.5 mg, during the flight. In addition to the medication, they also consumed ethyl alcohol to a variable degree, none to clinical intoxication. All three experienced an episode of anterograde amnesia that lasted several hours. In two of the individuals, neurologists associated with them did not detect any memory disturbance at the time. These episodes of transient global amnesia were evidently secondary to the triazolam or the combination of triazolam and ethyl alcohol. These episodes suggest caution if using this medication to avoid jet lag, especially if ethyl alcohol will be consumed.
