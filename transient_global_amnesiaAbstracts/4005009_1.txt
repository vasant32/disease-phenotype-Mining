Transient global amnesia is a not uncommon presentation of acutely altered neuropsychiatric status. It is, however, a clinical diagnosis that requires a careful history with attention to inciting events, risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, the absence of other abnormalities on neurological examination, and normal results of laboratory studies. Knowledge of the generally benign course of TGA can facilitate the care and psychological support of these patients and their families.
