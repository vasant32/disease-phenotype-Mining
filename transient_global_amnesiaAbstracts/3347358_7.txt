We describe the clinical and neuroradiologic features of a patient with two episodes of transient amnesia who later developed persistent amnesia and an acute infarction in the left thalamus. The neurobehavioral manifestations were strikingly similar in all three episodes. Cranial computed tomography was normal following the first two episodes. Thalamic ischemia could explain some cases of transient global amnesia.
