A 40-year-old man suffered an attack of transient global amnesia. The anterograde amnesia receded after 2 days, but a deficit remained in the retrieval stage of memory, which impaired the recall of names and of the information necessary to give details of particular events. Computed tomography revealed ischaemic infarction in the left anterolateral thalamus.
