A 43-year-old man developed severe global amnesia with uncinate fits and a single generalised convulsion 10 days after a febrile infection. CSF pleocytosis and serological findings indicated an acute Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis. All of the symptoms cleared within 2 weeks except for occasional generalised seizures. This seems to be the first observation of Epstein-Barr virus encephalitis presenting predominantly as transient global amnesia.
