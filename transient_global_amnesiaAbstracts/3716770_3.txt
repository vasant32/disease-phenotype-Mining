The occurrence of cerebral infarction in patients with transient global amnesia (n = 43) was evaluated by CT scan and compared to that of patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) (n = 58) and with no neurological disease (n = 52). Significant differences were demonstrated between TGA and TIA patients in relation to the control group, but no differences were found between patients with TGA and TIA. Our study suggests a vascular mechanism for TGA and that TGA could be considered a low risk TIA in most cases.
