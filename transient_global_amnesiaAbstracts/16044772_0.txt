Transient global amnesia (TGA) occurs mostly in middle-aged and elderly individuals, and is generally believed to be very rare in individuals less than 40 years of age. We present three cases of TGA in young persons (16-22 years). They all had a medical history and presented symptoms fulfilling the criteria for TGA. Physical examinations and investigations were all normal. All three presented their symptoms while playing football. Reviewing the literature the suggested causes are partly different for TGA in old and young people, respectively. The present report confirms that TGA may also occur in younger individuals. We propose that single TGA is a benign condition also in younger persons and that the investigation should be similar to that of TGA in older age groups.
