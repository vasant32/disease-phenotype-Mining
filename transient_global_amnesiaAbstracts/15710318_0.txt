The emergence of a sudden, global, and fully reversible amnestic state during an intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP) performed in a patient with a right temporal tumor is described. Forms of amnesia during the IAP are discussed, and it is argued that because of its appearance, the associated behavioral abnormalities, and EEG findings, this state was a transient global amnesia (TGA). In addition to other origins such as bitemporal lesions, increased barbiturate levels, seizures, and epileptic amnesia, TGA may triggered by stress or angiography during the IAP.
