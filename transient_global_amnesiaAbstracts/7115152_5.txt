Because of a case of typical transient global amnesia following cerebral angiography, the records of all patients undergoing cerebral angiography during a seven-year period were reviewed. Six other cases were discovered. All patients had either transfemoral catheter or brachial angiograms performed immediately before the development of amnesia. Spasm of a vertebral artery was noted in one case. None had clinically obvious seizures. All recovered within 24 hours. This only recently reported complication of cerebral angiography is consistent with a vascular etiology of the syndrome of transient global amnesia when not associated with angiography, although a direct toxic effect of the contrast material cannot be excluded.
