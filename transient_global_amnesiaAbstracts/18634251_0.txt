We report a 53-year-old female patient who presented a sudden dramatic memory disorder following coronary and cerebral angiography. The patient was disoriented and kept repeating the same questions about time and place. Transient global amnesia was ultimately diagnosed using the Hodges and Warlow criteria. We briefly discuss how to distinguish transient global amnesia from psychogenic amnesia, transient epileptic amnesia and transient ischemic attack.
