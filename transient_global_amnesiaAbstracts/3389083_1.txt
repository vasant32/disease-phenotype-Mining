A case is described which presented as transient global amnesia (TGA) due to a critically placed intracerebral hypertensive haematoma in the left thalamic region, with epileptic discharges arising from the same area. It is proposed that intracerebral haematomas may occasionally present as a clinically well-defined neurological syndrome. The deficit in such cases is probably not due to the underlying direct tissue damage but secondary to indirect pressure or ischaemic insults.
