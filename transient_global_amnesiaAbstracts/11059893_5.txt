In this longitudinal study multichannel MEG was used to localize and to quantify focal pathological spontaneous neuromagnetic activity in six patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and two patients with transient global amnesia (TGA). Slow (2-6 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) activity were monitored up to 10 weeks. Results were compared with normative data, and changes over time were statistically analyzed. MEG detected pathological activity that persisted clinical symptoms. Focal slow activity originating from sensorimotor (TIA) and mesiotemporal (TGA) cortices exceeded normal values up to 14 times during the first hours after the attack and recovered to normal within 11 days. Focal beta activity was not useful to monitor the time course of TIA or TGA.
