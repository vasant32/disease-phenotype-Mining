The patient, a 55 year-old man, developed an episode of transient global amnesia. He was a smoker and had hypercholesterolemia. He was found to have a positive rapid plasma reagin test and high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies. Other investigations were negative. The presence in this patient of antiphospholipid antibodies suggests a vascular mechanism for transient global amnesia.
