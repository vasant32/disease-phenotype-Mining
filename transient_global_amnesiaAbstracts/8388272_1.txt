We describe two patients who displayed unusual neurologic manifestations associated with reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The patients included a 34-year-old woman who suffered from meningoencephalitis presenting with symptoms identical to those of transient global amnesia, and a 57-year-old man with jumbling phenomenon and gait ataxia. The protean neurologic manifestations of EBV infection underscore the need to suspect this infection in any acute neurologic disorders of possible infectious origin irrespective of the age of the patient.
