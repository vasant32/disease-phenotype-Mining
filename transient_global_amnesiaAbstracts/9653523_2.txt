An episode of transient global memory loss was observed in a 27-year-old woman following a mild head injury in a car accident. Her clinical and neuropsychological profiles were indistinguishable from those of transient global amnesia (TGA). This paper argues that a cause-effect relationship may be postulated between head trauma and transient memory loss, perhaps as the result of a very stressful situation such as a car crash.
