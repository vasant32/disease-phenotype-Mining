Transient global amnesia is a clinical syndrome characterized by sudden onset of short-term memory loss followed by retrograde amnesia in an otherwise healthy subject. During the attack, the patient remains alert and retains much of his personal identity. The patient usually becomes upset and concerned about his memory loss. This condition may be diagnosed incorrectly as hysteria, psychosis, or temporal lobe seizure, despite its unique clinical features.
