Transient global amnesia, epilepsy, and migraine are three common neurologic disorders likely to be encountered by military physicians.

We report a patient who exemplifies the indistinct boundaries among these conditions and whose response to treatment supports the use of anticonvulsants for selected patients who have recalcitrant migraine.
