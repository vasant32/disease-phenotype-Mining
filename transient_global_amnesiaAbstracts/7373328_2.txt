A case of transient global amnesia of clear vascular aetiology is described. Results of neuropsychological testing carried out during the attack clarify the nature of the memory disorder and suggest that the critical region of ischaemia is the medial temporal area around the hippocampus. Follow-up testing suggests that no lasting memory impairment resulted.
