A Japanese female case of transient global amnesia (TGA), who developed an amnesic episode after sexual intercourse, is reported. The mechanism of how TGA in the present case is precipitated by sexual intercourse could be explained by the elevated blood pressure during sexual intercourse that drops rapidly, causing a temporal ischemia in the distribution of the basilar artery. Furthermore, the importance of sexual intercourse as a precipitating factor of TGA is stressed.
