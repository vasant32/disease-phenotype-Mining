Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) is a well defined pure amnesic clinical syndrome characterized by acute loss of memory in middle aged people. The aetiology of TGA is still unknown but clinical and neuroimaging studies support a hippocampi involvement, and some reports suggested a possible common genetic background in cases of familial TGA. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene that causes a valine to methionine substitution at codon 66 (Val66Met) has been demonstrated to affect human memory and hippocampal function in the development and maintenance of adult neurons. Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on TGA risk and all TGA clinical features. Ninety-eight TGA patients and 93 age-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent clinical and neurological examination, routine blood examination, EEG, Jugular vein valve (JVI) competence assessment, and neuroimaging study. TGA characteristics were carefully recorded. The distribution of BDNF genotype did not differ in TGA patients compared to controls (BDNF GG: 58.2% vs 55.9%, GA: 33.7% vs 36.6%, AA: 8.1% vs 7.5%, P=.91) as well as allele frequency (BDNF G, TGA vs CON: 75.0% vs 74.2, P=.47). No significant differences in age at onset, disease duration and recurrence or the presence of predisposing factors between TGA patients carrying BDNF AA, BDNF GA and BDNF GG genotype were found. This study, that firstly looked at genetic background in TGA, did not show a significant correlation between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and age of onset, risk factors, duration or recurrence of TGA.
