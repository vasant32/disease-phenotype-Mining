We describe a case of transient global amnesia related to symptomatic renal stones. Transient global amnesia has been related to intense emotional or painful experiences, such as sexual intercourse, cold water bathing and trigeminal stimulation. Renal stones may be at the origin of a painful experience and thus may induce transient global amnesia.
