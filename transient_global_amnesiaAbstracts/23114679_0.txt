 INTRODUCTION: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with multiorgan involvement. FD is caused by a partial or total deficit of Î±-galactosidase A enzyme, which is responsible for the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in a variety of cell types. Neurological complications include central nervous system involvement with cerebrovascular disease, peripheral neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 47-year-old man with an atypical neurological presentation of FD, characterized by 48-hour consciousness alteration with amnesia, resembling a long-lasting episode of transient global amnesia. CONCLUSIONS: Our case expands the neurological presentations associated with FD.
