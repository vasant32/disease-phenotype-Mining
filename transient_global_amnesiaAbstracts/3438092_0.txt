The term migraine accompagnée or complicated migraine is applied to those cases of migraine in whom a neurological deficit, which is transient in most instances, occurs. The three main varieties are hemiplegic (unilateral sensory loss, hemiplegia, aphasia), basilar (brain stem dysfunction) and ophthalmoplegic migraine. The clinical symptoms of migraine accompagnée in children and adolescents are discussed on the basis of the observations in 26 patients (11 boys, 15 girls) and the results of EEG-, CT- and angiographic investigations are referred. A special case of "migraine without headache" and a case of "transient global amnesia" are reported.
