Dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) of the anterior cranial fossa is associated usually with cerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage, while an association with transient global amnesia has not been reported previously. A case presenting the latter unusual symptom is described and the surgical treatment of AVF is discussed. A 64-year-old woman was hospitalized complaining of transient memory impairment. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a flow void in the left frontal lobe and temporal pole. Cerebral angiography revealed an AVF in the anterior cranial fossa, which was fed bilaterally by the ethmoidal arteries and by branches of the external carotid arteries. The AVF drained into the superior sagittal sinus and the superficial sylvian vein via large varices. Following transfemoral embolization, surgical treatment was carried out. Postoperative angiography revealed complete obliteration of the anomaly. There were no further episodes of amnesia. In our presented case, there is an association between the presenting symptoms and the AVF. The combination of ischemia and congestion in the frontal and temporal lobes may have caused transient memory impairment. From our surgical experience, the excision of the vascular connection between the dura and the frontal lobe following the coagulation of the dura mater of the anterior part of the base of the skull without extensive excision seems to be recommended.
