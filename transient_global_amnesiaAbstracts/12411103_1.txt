OBJECTIVE: To study cognitive function and cerebral metabolic changes in patients with transient global amnesia (TGA). METHODS: Three patients with TGA were given mini-mental state examination (MMSE), revised Wechsler memory scale (WMS-R) examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans after they had been diagnosed as TGA. Using (18)F labelled deoxyglucose as tracer, patients were given a positron emission tomography (PET) examination at different periods during recovery. RESULTS: No obvious abnormality was found in MMSE and MRI scans in the three patients. However, WMS-R examination and cerebral PET imaging displayed cognitive dysfunction of varying degrees and low metabolism in local areas related to memory in 2 of 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In TGA patients, cognitive function and cerebral metabolic levels are closely correlated with duration of symptoms. It is necessary to stop the TGA attack as quickly as possible early time.
