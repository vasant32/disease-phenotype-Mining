The authors studied 18 cases of transient global amnesia, a syndrome occurring in middle age, characterized by a sudden memory loss of recent events and transient inability to acquire new knowledge, while consciousness and personal identity are preserved. Chemical and laboratory findings indicates that TGA is probably due to transient ischemia in the temporal lobe and hippocampus.
