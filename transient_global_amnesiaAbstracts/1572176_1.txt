Verbal learning and forgetting were studied in patients one month after an episode of Transient Global Amnesia and in normal control subjects by means of a two-stage stochastic model, which allows independent measurements of encoding, storage and forgetting. We preliminarily ascertained both the necessity and the sufficiency of the model to account for several performance scores of the two experimental groups, and then compared the learning and forgetting functions between groups. In spite of the analytical power of the statistical method adopted. Transient Global Amnesia was not found to entail persistent impairment of encoding and storage, as well as of retaining memory traces and retrieval algorhythm.
