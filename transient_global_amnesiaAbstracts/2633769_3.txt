Transient global amnesia has been associated with cerebral angiography performed with use of ionic agents. Nonionic contrast agents are associated with fewer complications, but complications do occur. The authors describe two patients who developed transient global amnesia after they underwent cerebral angiography with iopamidol. The precise pathophysiologic mechanism remains unclear, but the syndrome is by definition self-limited.
