Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is a solvent commonly used for the cryopreservation of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (APBSC). Side effects upon infusion of DMSO-cryopreserved APBSC mainly consist of nausea, emesis, chills, rigors, and cardiovascular events, such as bradyarrhythmia or hypotension. We report the case of a patient who received DMSO-cryopreserved APBSC after myeloablative chemotherapy for a relapsing lymphoma. The patient developed a rare reaction during the infusion manifesting as transient global amnesia. The clinical course during the reaction is described and an explanation of the possible causes is discussed. This observation underlines the need for an adequate DMSO depletion to limit neurotoxicity or other adverse manifestations.
