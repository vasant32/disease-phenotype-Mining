A long-term follow-up study was performed on patients with transient global amnesia (TGA) in order to evaluate the prognosis, the recurrence rate and the occurrence of stroke and dementia. 102 patients (57 women, 45 men; mean age 62.8 +/- 9.4 years) were prospectively included and followed up. The follow-up duration ranged between 12 and 241 months with an average value of 82.2 +/- 51.1 (mean +/- SD). The death rate showed no difference from that of sex- and age-matched subjects. TGA recurred in 19 cases (18.63%). Only 4 patients suffered subsequent stroke, and only 3 showed intellectual deterioration. TGA prognosis was shown to be better than that of RIA and lacunar patients.
