We studied two sexagenarians who had recurrent circumscribed attacks of amnesia. Their EEGs showed frequent bilateral spikes that arose independently from the temporal lobes, primarily from mesiobasal structures. Amnesic attacks ceased after treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Neuropsychological tests demonstrated selective cognitive impairments, and short-term memory improved after treatment in one patient. Epileptic amnesic attacks should be distinguished from transient global amnesia, which is clinically similar.
