The case of a previously healthy 69-year-old female patient is described who presented, in a period of 6 months, 3 long-lasting (from 2 hour- to 10 hour-duration) episodes of transient global amnesia accompanied by a temperature rise. During one of these episodes an EEG was obtained, showing a diffuse alteration, focal slowing, and bitemporal asynchronous paroxysmal activity giving rise to electrical ictal discharges. Interictal EEGs were normal. Cerebral computed tomography was normal. Carbamazepine was given with complete control of the attacks. These episodes may be interpreted as complex partial status with unusual semeiology.
