BACKGROUND: Acute amnesia can be caused by medication effect, transient global amnesia, ischemia, metabolic abnormalities, and seizures. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 56-year-old woman developed acute amnesia resembling transient global amnesia (TGA) after aneurysm coiling. She was started on abciximab for possible thromboembolic complications related to coiling. Abciximab was discontinued after she developed chest pain. Her chest pain resolved after discontinuing abciximab. She was subsequently found to have small medial temporal lobe strokes on diffusion weighted MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia in the posterior circulation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of TGA, especially in situations predisposing to thromboembolism such as coiling.
