Sixteen patients, who had suffered only one episode of transient global amnesia and showed no clinically evident abnormalities in their follow-up, were examined with psychometric and memory tests. Deficits in verbal long-term memory and in verbal IQ were found. These observations seem to demonstrate that in transient global amnesia patients regarded as being 'normal' in their follow-up there is no complete recovery and the sequelae seem to conform to a definite pattern. Problems of nosology and localization are discussed.
