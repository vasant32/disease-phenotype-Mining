A case of permanent global amnesia resulting from a bilateral hippocampal lesion is reported, remarkable for its typical clinical picture and prolonged period of observation with repeated neuropsychological testing. No tendency toward spontaneous recovery was noted, even though extra-mnesic cognitive functions remained undamaged. No differences were observed between this amnesic syndrome and the neuropsychological picture during an acute episode of transient global amnesia.
