INTRODUCTION: Transient global amnesia is a syndrome mainly characterised by an anterograde memory deficit, which disappears in less than 24 hours without leaving any kind of sequelae. Its aetiopathogenesis is still unclear. The ischemic theory became important after hypoperfusion was observed in the mesial region of the temporal lobe using different imaging techniques, although recently the use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging by other authors has not revealed these alterations in the cerebral blood flow. CASE REPORT: We report on a transcranial Doppler study carried out in a female patient during the acute phase of the amnesia, with no evidence of hemodynamic alterations or significant asymmetries. Repeating the test after clinical recovery offered values that were similar to those of the previous study. CONCLUSIONS: It is posited that the basis of this process would not be related to ischemia but instead to a mechanism enabling spreading neurogenic depression that is similar to that which takes place during a migraine attack. Treatment with antiplatelet drugs would not, therefore, be recommended but calcium antagonists or beta blockers would be useful in preventing the clinical picture from being repeated.
