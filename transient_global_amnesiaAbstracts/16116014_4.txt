Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an amnestic syndrome, clinically dramatic but benign in nature. The hallmark of TGA is brief inability to form new memories and recall past memories despite otherwise normal neurological function. In a significant number of patients with TGA a stressful precipitating factor can be identified. We report two cases of TGA after uneventful general anesthesia. Anesthesia per se does not appear to be a direct trigger of TGA, as our first patient had a second anesthetic the next day without recurrence of TGA. Because the presentation of TGA can be dramatic and may mimic an acute cerebral ischemic event, a thorough neurologic evaluation should be pursued.
