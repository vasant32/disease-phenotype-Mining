Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a well-recognized clinical entity, but its pathophysiology and prognosis have remained arguable. We reported that a 63-year-old woman with scleroderma developed two TGA episodes. The patient sometimes suffered from headaches when Raynaud's phenomenon appeared in her fingers, but she did not experience further cerebrovascular events. This case suggests that the unique clinical presentation of this syndrome may result from an ischemic event, possibly triggered by a vasospastic mechanism like Raynaud's phenomenon.
