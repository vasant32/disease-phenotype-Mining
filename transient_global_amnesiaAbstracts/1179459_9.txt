A 54-year-old woman with transient global amnesia (TGA) was found to have digitalis-induced bradyarrhythmia with atrioventricular dissociation. The amnesia cleared only upon resolution of the arrhythmia. Cardiac arrhythmia has been postulated as a cause, but TGA in the setting of cardiac arrhythmia has not been documented previously. Cardiac arrhythmia should be excluded in patients with TGA, and TGA, a syndrome diagnosed on clinical grounds alone, must be recognized as one possible manifestation of treatable, potentially serious cardiac or cerebrovascular disease.
