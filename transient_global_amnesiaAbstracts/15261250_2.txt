The pathogenesis and localization of neuronal dysfunction in transient global amnesia (TGA) is still disputed more than 40 years after the first description of this clinical entity. Previous studies have indicated that structural abnormality is rare in TGA. We report a case of TGA in a patient with acute ischemia in the body of right caudate nucleus. This provides evidence in support of an ischemic hypothesis as the possible etiology of TGA. The role of caudate nucleus in human memory is also reviewed.
