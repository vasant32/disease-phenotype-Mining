A 61 year old male patient with left mandibular cyst, received marsupialization of the left mandible under general anesthesia. Four hours after the end of anesthesia, his memory for the past 4 months and short term memory plastisity were impaired. No neurological abnormalies were found at that time. On the 2nd postoperative day, he recovered his lost memory for the past 4 months. The memory of events between 6 hours before operation and next morning, however, remained lost. It is suggested that the memory disorder is the TGA due to various causes including transient hypertension, operative stress, postoperative pain and diazepam.
