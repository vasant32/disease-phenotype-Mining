Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a well-defined clinical syndrome of unknown etiology, which often occurs once in life. Several mechanisms have been proposed but only trigger events have been clearly associated with the attack such as physical exertion, emotional stress, sexual intercourse or immersion in cold water. According to our knowledge, this is the first study, which associates trigger events and TGA recurrency. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors which contribute to TGA recurrency. TGA patients consecutively admitted, performed clinical and neurological evaluation, electroencephalogram and structural brain imaging scan. TGA-trigger events were evaluated and comorbidities were carefully recorded. The risk factor sum was calculated as the sum of the considered triggers. Eighty-five TGA patients were grouped according to the presence of single TGA (n = 73) or two episodes of TGA (n = 12). The 14.11% of patients experienced two episodes. A logistic regression analysis showed that the more increased number of TGA the more number of trigger events (P < 0.11; chi2 = 6.38; beta = -3.29). These observations claim that TGA may be considered a complex epiphenomenon, and the sum of the trigger factors can be responsible for recurring of this almost unique-in-life event.
