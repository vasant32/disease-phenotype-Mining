A 43-year-old woman one day experienced a dissociative fugue which she could not recall. She was married, nulliparous, with no history of dissociative disorder or other psychiatric disorders. She had been sexually abused during late childhood-early adolescence. She was examined thoroughly from both psychiatric and medical standpoints to exclude organic causes for her condition. Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed only some non-specific abnormalities. On personality tests, a histrionic structure of personality emerged, with obsessive and narcissistic traits accompanied by rigidity and anxiety, dysphoria and high risk for depression; some impairment was found in executive function tests. Final diagnosis was one of dissociative fugue. In fact, organic traits were not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of Transient Global Amnesia.
