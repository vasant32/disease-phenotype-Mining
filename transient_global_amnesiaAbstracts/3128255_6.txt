The P3 evoked potential has been linked to memory mechanisms, but its neuronal generators are uncertain. Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a disorder of recent memory that has been postulated to result from ischemia or focal seizures in the medial temporal lobes and/or thalamus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a recording of P3 evoked potential and sphenoidal electroencephalogram during TGA. The tonal P3 was not decremented in comparison to P3 recordings one month and two years after recovery. Sphenoidal electroencephalogram was normal. The results suggest that the neuronal networks which generate the tonal P3 are not involved in the part of the memory system affected by TGA.
