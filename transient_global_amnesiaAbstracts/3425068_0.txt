Nine patients with the syndrome of transitory global amnesia (TGA) have been examined. The authors present the clinical characteristics of the syndrome, describe the differential diagnosis, forms and course of the syndrome, as well as methods of its treatment and prognosis. It has been demonstrated that the syndrome of TGA may develop in the presence of both primary cerebral pathology (insufficient circulation in the vertebrobasilar system) and general pathogenic impacts leading to impairment of the systemic and cerebral hemodynamics. It has been established that transient recurrent mnemonic disturbances during the follow-up are associated with the formation of a stable Korsakoff's syndrome. Methods of therapy of these disorders have been developed and the diagnostic and prognostic significance of neuropsychological examination has been demonstrated.
