 BACKGROUND: Transient global amnesia is a fairly common occurrence in patients arriving to the emergency department. In most cases, transient global amnesia is benign, and the etiology remains unknown; however, it is important to exclude the rare but serious causes ensuring proper treatment and prevention of serious complication. CASE REPORT: We present a rare case in which a patient arrived with amnesia, and after full evaluation; a subtle ischemic region in the hippocampus was identified, allowing the patient to be treated. In most cases of transient global amnesia, the cause is seldom identified. CONCLUSIONS: We review the diagnostic criteria, risk factors, and imaging considerations associated.
