<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DNA ligase IV is an essential protein that functions in DNA non-homologous end-joining, the major mechanism that rejoins DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LIG4 syndrome represents a human disorder caused by mutations in DNA ligase IV that lead to impaired but not ablated activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus far, five conserved motifs in DNA ligases have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously reported G469E as a mutational change in a LIG4 syndrome patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G469 does not lie in any of the previously reported motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A sequence comparison between DNA ligases led us to identify residues 468-476 of DNA ligase IV as a further conserved motif, designated motif Va, present in eukaryotic DNA ligases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We carried out mutational analysis of residues within motif Va examining the impact on adenylation, double-stranded ligation, and DNA binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We interpret our results using the DNA ligase I:DNA crystal structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Substitution of the glycine at position 468 with an alanine or glutamic acid severely compromises protein activity and stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substitution of G469 with an alanine or glutamic acid is better tolerated but still impacts upon activity and protein stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These finding suggest that G468 and G469 are important for protein stability and provide insight into the hypomorphic nature of the G469E mutation identified in a LIG4 syndrome patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, residues 470, 473 and 476 within motif Va can be changed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32441">alanine residues</z:chebi> without any impact on DNA binding or adenylation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Importantly, however, such mutational changes do impact upon double-stranded ligation activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considered in light of the DNA ligase I:DNA crystal structure, our findings suggest that residues 470-476 function as part of a molecular pincer that maintains the DNA in a conformation that is required for ligation </plain></SENT>
