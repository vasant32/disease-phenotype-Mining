<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although four of the five identified patients display <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, one patient was developmentally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The developmentally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patient had the same homozygous mutation (R278H) in DNA ligase IV as one of the more severely affected patients, who additionally had two linked polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine the impact of the mutations and polymorphisms identified in the LIG4 syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of recombinant mutant proteins shows that the severity of the clinical features correlates with the level of residual ligase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The polymorphisms decrease the activity of DNA ligase IV by approximately 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When combined with the otherwise mild R278H mutation, the activity is reduced to a level similar to other LIG4 patients who display <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates how coupling of a mutation and polymorphism can have a marked impact on protein function and provides an example where a polymorphism may have influenced clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of additional mutational changes in LIG4 syndrome (R580X, R814X and G469E) have led to the identification of a nuclear localization signal in DNA ligase IV and sites impacting upon DNA ligase IV adenylation </plain></SENT>
