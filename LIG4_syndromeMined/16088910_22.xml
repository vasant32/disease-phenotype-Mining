<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a 4(1/2)-year-old boy who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The facial gestalt was strongly reminiscent of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient died shortly after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment for his T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003220'>chromosome breakage</z:hpo> studies showed a high rate of breakage in a fibroblast culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiosensitivity was assessed by a colony survival assay; the results showed radiosensitivity greater than is typically seen in <z:chebi fb="28" ids="53174">NBS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening of the NBS1 gene was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the LIG4 gene revealed a homozygous truncating mutation 2440 C&gt;T (R814X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although this mutation has been previously noted in LIG4 syndrome, this patient is the first reported homozygote for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study, we review the clinical features of this rare syndrome and provide suggestions for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
