<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we address this question by taking advantage of the highly specific role of DNA ligase IV in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining, and by the discovery of a unique mouse strain with a hypomorphic Lig4(Y288C) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Lig4(Y288C) mouse, identified by means of a mutagenesis screening programme, is a mouse model for human LIG4 syndrome, showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diminished DNA double-strand break repair in the Lig4(Y288C) strain causes a progressive loss of haematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow cellularity during ageing, and severely impairs stem cell function in tissue culture and transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of haematopoietic stem cells to non-homologous end-joining deficiency is therefore a key determinant of their ability to maintain themselves against physiological stress over time and to withstand culture and transplantation </plain></SENT>
