<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell lines from these patients are characterized by sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA ligase IV syndrome (LIG4) patients specifically, for unknown reasons, respond particularly badly following treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> or BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the first systematic evaluation of the response of LIG4 syndrome to compounds routinely employed for BMT conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found human pre-B lymphocytes, a key target population for BMT conditioning, when deficient for DNA ligase IV, unexpectedly exhibit significant sensitivity to CsA the principal prophylaxis for GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that CsA treatment alone or in combination with BU and fludarabine resulted in increased levels of DSBs specifically in LIG4 syndrome cells compared to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or Artemis-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that CsA can induce DSBs and that LIG4 syndrome patient's fail to adequately repair this damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These DSBs likely arise as a consequence of DNA replication in the presence of CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This work has implications for BMT and GVHD management in general and specifically for LIG4 syndrome </plain></SENT>
