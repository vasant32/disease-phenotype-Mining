<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypomorphic LIG4 mutations in humans are associated with increased cellular radiosensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphisms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, and a variable degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have generated a knock-in mouse model with a homozygous Lig4 R278H mutation that corresponds to the first LIG4 mutation reported in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of homozygous mutant mice Lig4(R278H/R278H) (Lig4(R/R)) includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo>, a decreased life span, a severe cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and a very severe, but incomplete block in T and B cell development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T lymphocytes show an activated and anergic phenotype, <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp>, and a restricted repertoire, reminiscent of human leaky <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic instability is associated with a high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040116" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">thymic tumor</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, Lig4(R/R) mice spontaneously produce low-affinity antibodies that include autoreactive specificities, but are unable to mount high-affinity antibody responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the importance of LIG4 in lymphocyte development and function, and in genomic stability maintenance, and provide a model for the complex phenotype of LIG4 syndrome in humans </plain></SENT>
