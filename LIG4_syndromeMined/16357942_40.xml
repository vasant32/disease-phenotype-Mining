<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>V(D)J recombination of Ig and TCR loci is a stepwise process during which site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are made by RAG1/RAG2, followed by DSB repair by nonhomologous end joining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in V(D)J recombination result in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> characterized by absence of mature B and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of T-B-NK+ <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> patients is sensitive to ionizing radiation, and the majority of these patients have mutations in Artemis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with a new type of radiosensitive T-B-NK+ <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> with a defect in DNA ligase IV (LIG4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, LIG4 mutations have only been described in a radiosensitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patient and in 4 patients with a designated LIG4 syndrome, which is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and developmental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient described here shows that a LIG4 mutation can also cause T-B-NK+ <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> without developmental defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LIG4-deficient <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> patient had an incomplete but severe block in precursor B cell differentiation, resulting in extremely low levels of blood B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The residual D(H)-J(H) junctions showed extensive nucleotide deletions, apparently caused by prolonged exonuclease activity during the delayed D(H)-J(H) ligation process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, different LIG4 mutations can result in either a developmental defect with minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> or a <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> picture with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
