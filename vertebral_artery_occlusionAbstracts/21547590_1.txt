 BACKGROUND: The indications for bevacizumab (a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor) have been expanded recently. Despite concerns for cerebrovascular events from bevacizumab treatment, detailed clinical and radiologic information are lacking. METHODS: Using the Mayo Clinic Rochester database (January 2006-September 2010), we identified bevacizumab-treated patients who developed intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 3 weeks of bevacizumab treatment. Functional recovery was assessed using the modified Rankin scale 3 months following the onset of cerebrovascular events. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients (median age 58 years, range 37-86) were included in this study. These patients received bevacizumab for a median duration of 3 months (range 2-4 months) for cancer treatment, and developed cerebrovascular events that comprised intratumoral hemorrhage (n = 7), cerebral watershed infarction (n = 1), transient ischemic attack (n = 1), and left vertebral artery occlusion (n = 1). Seven patients had chronic hypertension which was adequately controlled with a single anti-hypertensive agent. Significant increase in blood pressure was observed in nine patients during their acute presentation as compared with their baseline outpatient readings. Six patients died within 3 months of these cerebrovascular events, and the remaining four patients had modest functional recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular events are early and serious complications that should be considered in bevacizumab-treated patients who present with an acute neurologic deterioration.
