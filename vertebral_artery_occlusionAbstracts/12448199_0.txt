BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Various research protocols call for the vertebral artery (VA) occlusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The anterior aspect of the cervical spine was exposed, the small medial parts of two adjoining pedicles were removed and the VA was occluded by a small hemoclip. RESULTS: The vertebral artery was successfully occluded in 36 experimental animals. In 22 animals the occlusion was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: The technique proved to be very reliable and rather easy. Its main advantage seems to be the possibility of simultaneous access to vertebral and carotid arteries.
