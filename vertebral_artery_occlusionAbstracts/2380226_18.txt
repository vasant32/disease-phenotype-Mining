We studied 12 consecutive patients with facet joint dislocation in the cervical spine to assess the incidence, site and clinical sequelae of occlusion of the extracranial vertebral artery. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography was performed after the orthopaedic management of the dislocations. This demonstrated vertebral artery occlusion (one bilateral) in five of the seven patients with bilateral dislocations and in four of the five patients with unilateral dislocations. Two of the nine patients with vertebral artery occlusion had neurological deficits above the level of the injury, all of which resolved spontaneously within two months. In our experience, a distraction-flexion injury appears to be the most common cause of closed traumatic vertebral artery occlusion.
