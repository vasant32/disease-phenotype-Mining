Rotation-induced vertebrobasilar artery hypoperfusion causes transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), affecting the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. When these symptoms occur transiently due to head movement, compression of the vertebral artery by an extraluminal lesion should be suspected. Cervical spondylotic spurs and anterior scalene muscle or deep cervical fascia are among the factors which can compress the vertebral artery. When symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency occur with rotational head movement, subclavian angiography for visualization of the entire vertebral artery in both neutral and rotated head positions should be undertaken.
