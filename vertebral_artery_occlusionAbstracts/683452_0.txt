A case of cervical extradural neurinoma with total occlusion of the right vertebral artery is reported. The patient was a 22-year-old man who had suffered slowly progressive tetraparesis for 8 years. Neurological examination demonstrated spastic tetraparesis, muscle atrophy of the trunk and four extremities, and hypalgesia corresponding to C2, 3 and 4 dermatomes. Plain radiogram of the cervical spine revealed a large bony defect on the right side of C2 and C3 vertebrae and enlargement of the intervertebral foramen of the right C2-3. Vertebral angiogram showed a reticular tumor stain in the area of the bony defect mentioned above and an occlusion of the right vertebral artery at the level of the inferior border of the C2 vertebra. It's feeding arteries were radicular arteries. The tumor was located extradurally and excised successfully. Histology showed a typical neurinoma. Referring to the reported cases, vertebral angiography has been rarely performed and there were only three cases including our cases in which total occlusion of the vertebral artery was demonstrated.
