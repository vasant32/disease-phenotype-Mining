OBJECTIVE: To describe the endovascular treatment of posterior aneurysm with balloon occlusion of ipsilateral vertebral artery. METHODS: 10 patients aging from 12 to 52 years old with mean age 41 were performed occlusion of unilateral vertebral artery after 30 minutes test occlusion. The whole procedure was under systemic anticoagulation. The Willi's Circle was evaluated by MRA before treatment. RESULTS: No immediate complication occurred after the treatment. 10 patients were followed up for 3 months to 5 years. 8 of the 10 cases accepted MR or DSA examination. Focal infarction was found in one patient. The aneurysm was filling in contralateral vertebral artery angiography in one patient, but there was no symptom. CONCLUSION: Vertebral artery occlusion is an effective treatment to some complicated posterior circulation aneurysms, which is difficult to be clipped and coiled.
