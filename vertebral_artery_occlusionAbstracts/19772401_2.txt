Surgical decompression of the vertebral artery (VA) between the suboccipital area and C-1 is typically performed via a large midline incision or a far-lateral approach. Such traditional open approaches are often associated with significant muscle dissection and blood loss. In this case, a 12-year-old boy suffered a stroke related to a VA rotational occlusion (bow hunter syndrome) and dissection due to a prominent suboccipital bone mass. Successful decompression of the VA was performed via a minimally invasive 22-mm tubular retractor. This is the first reported case report of a minimally invasive decompression of the VA between the skull base and C-1.
