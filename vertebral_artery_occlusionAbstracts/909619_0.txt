Since Moniz reported the obstruction of the extracranial internal carotid artery in 1937, there have been many reports of extracranial arterial occlusion. The authors experienced a case  of  40-year-old woman who had minor neurological deficit such as attack of black out, disturbance of the bilateral visual acuity, concentric narrowing of the bilateral field and disturbance of the bilateral auditory acuity, in spite of complete obstruction of both internal carotid arteries and the left vertebral artery, and possible obstruction of the right vertebral artery. The angiograms showed well developed collateral circulation. The cause of the obstruction was considered to be angitis following otitis media and meningitis in her childhood. The symptoms were alleviated by drugtherapy.
