We report a patient with a right vertebral artery (VA) dissecting aneurysm who was treated by placing an Enterprise stent (Cordis Neurovascular, Miami Lakes, FL) from the proximal VA to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in order to save the patency of the PICA. A 47-year-old man was admitted with a ruptured right VA dissecting aneurysm that involved the origin of the PICA. A 4.5 x 37-mm Enterprise stent was then placed through the proximal VA to the PICA. The dissected segment of the VA was completely occluded by coil embolization. The 1-year follow-up angiography showed that the dissected segment was completely occluded and the diameter of the PICA was slightly increased, and the PICA's patency was good.
