BACKGROUND: Generally speaking, occlusion of the vertebral artery is a finding of a dissecting aneurysm associated with completed stroke. We present a case of a vertebral dissecting aneurysm that produced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Angiography on the day of hemorrhage, however, demonstrated complete occlusion of the vertebral artery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old hypertensive woman suffered a sudden onset of headache and vomiting followed by loss of consciousness due to SAH. Angiography on the day of hemorrhage revealed a complete occlusion of the right vertebral artery just distal to the dissecting aneurysm. This is the first report of such a case. The patient was still considered to be at significant risk of rerupture. Craniotomy and clip occlusion of the right vertebral artery and the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery were carried out to trap the thin-walled sac. At discharge, the patient had recovered completely except for some left limb ataxia, which subsequently disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Two options are available for the treatment of such a case: surgical or medical treatment. We employed surgery. Which is the preferred approach, however, is a difficult judgment to make at this juncture.
