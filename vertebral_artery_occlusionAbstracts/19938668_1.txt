We report a rare case of a ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm (VADA) with affected vertebral artery (VA) occlusion. A 66-year-old hypertensive man presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. No cerebeller sign or cranial nerve palsy was found on admission. Initial CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed the right VA occlusion. On the three days after onset, the right VA was recanalized and visualized as a posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)-involved VADA. Endovascular internal trapping of the right VA including PICA origin was performed. In conclusion, it is essential that patients of VA occlusion associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage should be carefully diagnosed considering the possibility of VADA.
