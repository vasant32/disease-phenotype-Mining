Summary: Giant basilar aneurysms are infrequently seen in children. We present the endovascular management of an adolescent who presented comatose with pinpoint pupils due to a ruptured giant basilar trunk aneurysm. A noncontrast head CT disclosed a large prepontine lesion with brainstem hemorrhage. Catheter angiography showed a 4.5 cm irregular, fusiform basilar trunk aneurysm. With SSEP, BAER, and MEP monitoring, the patient underwent bilateral temporary vertebral artery occlusion, followed by GDC embolization of the aneurysm. Postprocedure internal carotid angiograms showed adequate blood supply to the basilar apex via patent posterior communicating arteries. On postprocedure day two, the patient was following commands. The remainder of his hospital course was uneventful. Postoperative angiograms showed no residual filling of the aneurysm. At 12 months the patient was neurologically intact and at baseline function as an honor student and follow-up angiogram showed persistent occlusion of the aneurysm from the circulation. Successful endovascular treatment has been considered a less invasive and safer alternative to surgical management of some complex vascular lesions. While most reports on reversing basilar artery flow have been carried out in awake patients with neurological examinations, this is not possible in a patient presenting in a comatose state. This report suggests that SSEPs, BAERs and MEP may be of use in such patients in safely carrying out basilar artery occlusion.
