Posterior fossa ischemia is not a very frequent situation. It is responsible for about 25% of all ischemic strokes, and the vast majority of the cases are related to atherosclerotic stenosis of the vertebral and/or basilar arteries. Acute ischemia can also occur in the setting of vertebral artery dissection, traumatic or spontaneous. Recently, blunt trauma has been increasingly recognized as a cause for craniocervical artery injury. The management options for both traumatic and atherosclerotic lesions of the posterior fossa are still under debate. We present a case of a delayed onset of hemodynamic ischemic symptoms due to bilateral vertebral artery occlusion probably related to remote trauma to the head and neck in a 55-year-old-man treated successfully with extracranial to intracranial bypass.
