An aberrant right subclavian artery occurs in less than 2% of the population. An associated stenosis of the subclavian artery carries a risk of subclavian-coronary steal in patients who undergo coronary revascularization. We report on the case of a 54-year-old man admitted to our hospital for a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Angiographic examination revealed bilateral subclavian-artery stenosis with an aberrant right subclavian artery, anomalous origin of the right vertebral artery from the right common carotid artery, and left vertebral-artery occlusion. The patient underwent successful bilateral subclavian angioplasty and stenting.
