Traumatic vertebral artery injuries are relatively rare. Until recently, insufficient neurodiagnostic technology and a lack of normative data for the population of USAF aviators prevented recommending flying waivers following such vascular injuries. We report the case of an aviator who experienced a traumatic right vertebral artery occlusion with distal embolization. Timely access to a state-of-the-art neurodiagnostic evaluation, which included time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and standard contrast angiography, provided anatomic imaging at the time of injury and during the recuperative period. Sophisticated neurologic testing protocols at the Armstrong Laboratory's Aeromedical Clinical Sciences Division, Brooks Air Force Base, TX, assessed in-depth this individual's functional status. Consult Service evaluators then compared his performance data with current data in the Head Injury Study in Aviators (HISA) data base. MRA, in comparison with standard contrast angiography, demonstrated anatomic stability of his vascular and neurologic lesions. He demonstrated a functional capacity consistent with normal neurologic functioning in aviators which permitted recommending an occupational (flying) waiver. This case exemplified application of sophisticated ACS neurologic testing protocols to aeromedical evaluations and the use of MRA technology as a vascular screening tool during medical followup.
