We report a case of a bilateral vertebral dissecting aneurysm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Proximal ligation of the vertebral artery on the ruptured side combined with wrapping of the contralateral dissection failed to prevent fatal rebleeding. Since enlargement of the contralateral dissection was observed by postoperative angiography, rupture of the growing contralateral dissecting aneurysm may have caused rebleeding. Hemodynamic changes following the occlusion of one vertebral artery might have led to enlargement and subsequent rupture of the contralateral dissection. Direct wrapping was unable to prevent enlargement of the dissection, so radical surgery including bilateral vertebral artery occlusion combined with vascular reconstruction may be the treatment of choice for this type of lesion.
