Cases of cervical infarction with clearly documented evidence of the underlying aetiology and associated neuroradiological abnormalities have not been frequently reported. A rare case of cervical infarction caused by midvertebral artery occlusion due to spondylotic degeneration of the spine is described. The most probable aetiological factor affecting this disease entity, and the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of this rare lesion, are briefly discussed.
