A 40-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who presented with vertigo and nausea, was found to have left vertebral artery occlusion on angiography. There was minimal atlantoaxial subluxation and no odontoid herniation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was suggestive of a left vertebral artery dissection. This is the first report of MRI of vertebral artery occlusion in RA. It will be important to accumulate MR images of this complication in future cases.
