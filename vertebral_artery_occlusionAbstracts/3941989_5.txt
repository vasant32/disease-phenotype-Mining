A 55-year-old man developed a delayed locked-in syndrome after a mild head injury. Angiography showed bilateral distal vertebral artery occlusion. Anticoagulant therapy and energetic medical management to promote collateral circulation to the structures in the posterior fossa led to a functional recovery. A review of the reported cases of posttraumatic locked-in syndrome has allowed the authors to differentiate between two types: the first is due to primary brainstem injury and the second is due to secondary brainstem ischemia. Both types have different modes of onset, mechanisms of production, angiographic findings, and prognosis. It is concluded that, with early diagnosis and vigorous medical management, expectations for a useful recovery are high, especially in those cases of posttraumatic locked-in syndrome due to secondary brainstem ischemia.
