Use of rodent models of hippocampal neurodegeneration are recommended for use in studies to understand the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms involved. This unit includes protocols for two-vessel occlusion, three-vessel occlusion, and permanent bilateral vertebral artery occlusion plus methods for histological techniques for preparation of brain tissue and analysis of hippocampal injury.
