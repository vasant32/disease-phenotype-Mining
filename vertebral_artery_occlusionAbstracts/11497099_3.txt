Extreme acceleration and deceleration forces as well as axial loading are exerted at the occipito-cervical junction of drivers involved in high-velocity motor vehicle accidents, especially with fastened seatbelts. Injury at this level, usually lethal, can go unrecognized despite modern emergency management of the unconscious patient. A precise neurologic and radiographic workup of damage to this area is often not possible or overlooked in the initial phase of such severe trauma. We describe a patient with multiple injuries who sustained a left vertebral artery occlusion associated with a left-sided lateral mass fracture of C1 and a basilar artery occlusion resulting in a locked-in syndrome after an automobile accident.
