BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective study was to report the incidence, clinical presentation, and midterm clinical and imaging results of endovascular treatment of 10 aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar junction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and January 2007, 2112 aneurysms were treated in our institution. Ten aneurysms in 10 patients were located on the vertebrobasilar junction and 7 aneurysms (70%) were associated with proximal basilar fenestration. There were 5 men and 5 women, ranging from 29 to 75 years of age. Nine aneurysms presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and one was a giant partially thrombosed aneurysm with mass effect on the brain stem. RESULTS: Nine ruptured aneurysms were treated by primary coil occlusion. One giant unruptured aneurysm was initially treated with bilateral vertebral artery occlusion, 2 months later followed by selective coil occlusion of the remaining aneurysm lumen via the posterior communicating artery. At imaging follow-up of 6-30 months in 7 patients, all aneurysms were adequately occluded. In 2 patients, the vertebrobasilar junction and distal vertebral arteries (including the aneurysm) thrombosed completely on follow-up without clinical sequelae. CONCLUSION: Vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms are rare, with an incidence of 0.5% of treated aneurysms at our institution. Vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms are frequently associated with proximal basilar fenestration. Most patients present with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endovascular treatment is effective and safe in excluding the aneurysms from the circulation.
