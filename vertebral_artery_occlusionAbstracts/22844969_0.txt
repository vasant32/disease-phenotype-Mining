Abstract   Spinal osteochondromas constitute a small percentage of all intraspinal tumours, and are a rare cause of neurological symptoms. We describe a patient with a vertebral artery occlusion secondary to an osteochondroma of the C1 vertebra presenting with symptoms of cerebral ischaemia. This case is reported because of its extreme rarity.
