Vascular abnormalities or dissection of the vertebral artery are rare causes for cervical monoradiculopathy. We present the case of a 44-year-old female patient with a short history of radiculopathy of the right C5 root with radicular pain and a severe motor deficit. CT-imaging showed a hyperdense structure at the C4/C5 level suggesting a herniated disc. Because of the neurological deficit the patient was operated by a dorsal approach. Intraoperatively no herniated disc but only a congested epidural venous plexus was found. Postoperative MRI and angiography showed occlusion of the vertebral artery from C3 to C6 level probably due to dissection. The present case shows that a CT-study suggestive for a herniated disc can be misleading. Enlargement of the vertebral artery secondary to dissection or occlusion may lead to compression of the venous plexus which resembles disc material on CT-scan.
