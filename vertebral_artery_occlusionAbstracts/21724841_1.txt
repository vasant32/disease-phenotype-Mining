Endovascular treatment options have evolved in many ways and become an important alternative for open surgical repairs in various vascular territories. Herein, we present a case of an 18-year-old man with complex injury to the left subclavian artery and vein caused by a gunshot 4 months ago. After the gunshot, a high-flow fistula between the left subclavian artery and the vein occurred with pseudoaneurysm formation. This fistula led to a significant left subclavian steal phenomenon. A stent-graft was deployed along the injured left subclavian artery after embolization of the left vertebral artery by Amplatzer vascular plug 4 (AVP-4) in order to prevent subsequent endoleak due to the subclavian steal syndrome.
