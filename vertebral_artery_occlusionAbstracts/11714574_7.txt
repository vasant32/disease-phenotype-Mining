A 66-year-old man with cervical spondylosis noticed severe vertigo when turning his head to the right. He underwent subclavian arteriography elsewhere, which showed a block of the contrast medium in the right vertebral artery (VA) at the C5/6 level when the patient turned his head to the right. After referral to our institute, however, postcontrast CT scan revealed an attenuated shadow of the venous plexus around the right VA at the C3/4 level. Repeated selective angiography with rotation of the head after visualization of the entire VA verified the level of obstruction to be at C3/4. Resection of the C4 transverse process through an anterior approach with drilling of the C3/4 spondylotic spur of the uncinate processi completely resolved the arterial impingement and the symptom. When evaluating rotational VA occlusion, dynamic angiography with selective catheterization is essential in determining which level is affected. The postcontrast CT scan is also useful because it suggests the level even without head rotation.
