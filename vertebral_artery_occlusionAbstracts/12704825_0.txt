A 13-year-old boy suffered from cerebeller infarction due to right vertebral artery occlusion after heading a ball during a rainy soccer game. Dissection of the vertebral artery after trivial head trauma is well known, but heading as the cause has not been reported. We speculated in this present case that excessive impact force to the young boy's neck due to the heavy rain-soaked ball might have caused right vertebral artery dissection and occlusion. High quality balls are recommended for young amateur players on rainy days.
