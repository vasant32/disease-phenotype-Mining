Three cases of vertebral artery stenosis or occlusion at the level of the atlantoaxial joint during head rotation were reported. The vertebral artery was mechanically compressed on the side of the head opposite to the direction in which the heads was turned. One case was associated with atlantoaxial dislocation due to rheumatoid arthritis. Posterior fixations of C1 - C2 or C1 - C3 using iliac bone and wire were performed in two cases, and a neck collar was applied in another case. All of the three cases have been free from vertebrobasilar insufficiency since the treatment. The pathogenesis and treatment of vertebral artery occlusion at the atlantoaxial joint are discussed.
