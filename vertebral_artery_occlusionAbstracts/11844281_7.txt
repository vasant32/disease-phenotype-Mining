OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The carotid and the vertebrobasilar circulation were connected, effectively creating a new posterior communicating artery (PComA). The excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomosis technique is a new anastomosis technique whereby formerly untreatable patients may be treated with an intracranial artery-to-intracranial artery bypass procedure. This report is the first one in which an angiographically proved patent internal carotid artery-posterior cerebral artery segment P1 bypass is presented. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Our patient presented with repeated episodes of vertebrobasilar ischemia because of vertebral artery occlusion and stenosis. INTERVENTION: An internal carotid artery-posterior cerebral artery segment P1 bypass procedure was performed. Because the patient experienced transient ischemia in the left cerebral hemisphere at the end of postoperative angiography procedure, no radiological intervention was performed, and the patient refused to undergo a new radiological intervention at a later stage. TECHNIQUES: Both anastomoses were made using the excimer laser-assisted nonocclusive anastomosis technique. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative flowmetry was performed using an ultrasound flowmeter, which disclosed blood flow of 35 ml/min through the bypass. We hope that this new PComA suffices to protect the patient from infarction in the territory of the vertebrobasilar circulation.
