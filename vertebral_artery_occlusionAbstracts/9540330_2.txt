A 44-year-old female with transient vertigo and a 51-year-old female with headache and numbness of the hand presented with four vessel occlusion of the cerebral arteries (bilateral internal carotid arteries and bilateral vertebral arteries). This is an extremely rare entity, and the clinicoradiological features are not well documented. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography visualized the cerebral arterial occlusion. Conventional angiography confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated extensive collateral vessels. MR angiography is a useful method for screening patients with minimal or no symptoms for abnormalities in the cerebral circulation.
