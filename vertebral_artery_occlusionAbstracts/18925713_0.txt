OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of encephalic contents of somatostatin (SS) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in rats with vascular dementia. METHODS: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: vascular dementia group (VDMG), sham operation group (SOG) and control group (CG). The vascular dementia model was established by permanent bilateral vertebral artery occlusion through electric coagulation and shut-off the bilateral carotid arteries. The remember behavior of animals was tested and the contents of SS and AVP in various encephalic region (frontal cortex, temporal lobe, hippocampus, cerebral ganglion and corpora striatum) were determined with radioimmunoassay. RESULT: During the 15-day-long remembering test, the frequency of making mistakes in the VDMG was higher remarkably than that in SOG and CG (P<0.05); and the relative contents of SS were decreased in frontal area cortex, temporal lobe, hippocampus, cerebral ganglion and corpora striatum (P<0.01), while decrease of AVP contents was only detected in temporal lobe and corpora striatum (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The disturbance of learning and memory function might be associated with SS and AVP after multiple cerebral infarction in the animals.
