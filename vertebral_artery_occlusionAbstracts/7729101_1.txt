Upper cervical cord infarction in the territory of the posterior spinal artery is very rare. We present here an elderly man who developed right upper cervical (C1-2) posterior spinal artery syndrome associated with vertebral artery occlusion. A 62-year-old man suffered a right upper cervical (C1-2) posterior spinal artery syndrome. The onset was associated with neck flexion. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly showed an ischemic lesion. Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the distal end of an ipsilateral vertebral artery. The occlusion of the vertebral artery probably caused the cervical cord infarction. The neck flexion possibly induced thrombogenesis in the vertebral artery. Unilateral upper cervical posterior spinal artery syndrome associated with vertebral occlusion following neck flexion was suggested.
