A case of total vertebral artery occlusion by a cervical `hour-glass' or `dumb-bell' neurofibroma is reported. To the author's knowledge this is the first reported case in the English literature. A causal relationship between the arterial occlusion and the patient's symptoms has been postulated. The angiographic study of these patients is further emphasized to enhance safer and more effectual removal of these lesions.
