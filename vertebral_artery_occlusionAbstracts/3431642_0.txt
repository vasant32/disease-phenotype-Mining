Five cases of giant, fusiform, and dissecting aneurysms of the vertebro-basilar junction, in which direct surgical treatment was not feasible, are reported. Their initial symptoms were as follows: 3 subarachnoid hemorrhages (2 fusiform aneurysms, 1 giant aneurysm), 1 mass sign (giant aneurysm), and 1 ischemic sign (dissecting aneurysm). In two patients, one with a giant and one with a dissecting aneurysm, preoperative proximal vertebral occlusion was carried out by inflated balloon for 30 to 100 minutes, under observation of clinical signs and measurement of distal arterial pressure. This catheter technique with an inflated balloon provides the means to assess the effect of vertebral artery occlusion in the alert patient, and to determine if occlusion is tolerated or not. In one case with a giant aneurysm, the proximal vertebral artery was occluded extracranially with no complications and no recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage for 1 year. The other four patients (1 thrombosed giant aneurysm, 2 fusiform aneurysms, 1 dissecting aneurysm) whose contralateral vertebral arteries were hypoplastic, and who refused to operation, were treated conservatively for 6 months to 6 years. Their outcomes were better than expected, with no recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage nor aggravation of clinical symptoms except for the one case with a dissecting aneurysm whose deterioration was presumed attributable to late cerebellar cortical atrophy.
