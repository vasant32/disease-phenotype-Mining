The patient was a 67-year-old male. Preoperative DSA study revealed a right subclavian aneurysm, a brachiocephalic aneurysm, stenosis of the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, and occlusion of the left vertebral artery. An intraoperative occlusion test of the right vertebral artery showed a decline of the brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) seven minutes after the start of the procedure. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established by femoral arterial and bicaval cannulation. Under selective cerebral perfusion by cannulation of both common caroid arteries, a partial aortic arch replacement was performed using a graft patch with 3 branches. These three branches were connected to the right subclavian artery and to both common carotid arteries, respectively. Under deep hypothermia the right vertebral artery was reconstructed with the saphenous vein graft. Proximal anastomosis between the saphenous vein graft and the right caroid graft was done perfusion from a branch of the saphenous vein graft in order to shorten ischemic time of basilar arterial region. The patient was weaned from bypass without problems. After weaning the BAER test was again performed and found to be normal. The postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative DSA examination showed good blood flow in all the reconstructed vessels. This study suggests that deep hypothermia and shortening of ischemic time of the basilar arterial region are effective in preventing ischemic injury of the brain stem and the cerebellum.
