BACKGROUND: Strokes due to vertebral artery lesions are not yet well known in children. CASE REPORT: We report on a case of post-traumatic vertebral artery dissection responsible for ischemic stroke in a 8-year old boy. Headache, vomiting and a brief loss of consciousness were the main initial signs. Neurological examination showed a locked-in syndrome. Cerebral imaging revealed lesions in cortical cerebellar hemisphere, cerebral pedoncular and protuberance. An arteriogram performed on day 10 showed left vertebral artery occlusion at C2 levels consistent with vertebral dissection. Antiagregants treatment was given. Neurological recovery was good. Pertinent clinical data of 24 children who had strokes due to a vertebral artery dissection are analysed. CONCLUSION: Vertebral artery dissection is presently a well-known cause of childhood strokes. Benefits from anticoagulants are now established.
