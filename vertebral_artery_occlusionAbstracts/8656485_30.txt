The early diagnosis of cervical vascular trauma is critical in the prevention of cerebral ischemia. Traumatic blunt carotid or vertebral artery dissection is rare and frequently associated with other injuries. Diagnosis is often delayed, limiting treatment options and contributing to a poor outcome.

Treatment options are discussed and it is suggested that with modern methods of investigation and management, the prognosis of this condition may be improved.
