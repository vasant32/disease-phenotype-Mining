The clinical and pathological features of 28 fatal cases of acute uncomplicated massive cerebellar infarction are reviewed. Although infarcts may involve any portion of the cerebellum, they predominantly involve the posteroinferior half of one cerebellar hemisphere. The frequency of acute uncomplicated fatal cerebellar infarction is much greater than previously appreciated, approximating that of acute fatal cerebellar hemorrhage. All patients were past middle age. Atherosclerosis and acute vertebral artery occlusion were the most common etiological factors. The onset was sudden in most cases, with vomiting, dizziness, vertigo, and cerebellar dysfunction. All patients died with progressive brain stem dysfunction and medullary respiratory failure secondary to compression by a swollen cerebellum. Death usually occurred between the third and sixth days following the onset of symptoms, but only six to 30 hours after the onset of obtundation; therefore, decompressive therapy must be instituted promptly.
