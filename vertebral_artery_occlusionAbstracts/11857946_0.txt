We reported a case of a 79-year-old male with traumatic vertebral arteriovenous fistula. The patient was admitted with hemorrhagic shock due to arterial bleeding caused by a penetrating injury of the neck. Cervical CT showed free air at the level of the lamina of C1. Injury of the vertebral artery was suspected. The right vertebral angiogram showed an arteriovenous fistula between the V3 portion of the right vertebral artery and the suboccipital venous plexus with retrograde intracranial venous drainage. The patient underwent endovascular treatment of the parent vertebral artery occlusion, which successfully obliterated the arteriovenous fistula.
