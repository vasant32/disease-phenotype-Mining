 BACKGROUND: Rotational vertebral artery syndrome (RVAS) is a rare entity about which previously published studies are mostly limited to individual case reports. OBJECTIVE: To report our decade-long experience with this syndrome in 9 patients with compression ranging from the occiput to C6. METHODS: We utilized a posterior approach for lesions rostral to C4 and an anterior approach for lesions at or caudal to C4. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of a minimally invasive posterior cervical approach. Patient profile, operative indications, surgical approach, operative findings, complications, and long-term follow-up were reviewed and discussed. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 47 months. All procedures provided excellent outcomes by Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. The anterior approach had significantly less blood loss (187.5 mL vs 450 mL, P = .00016) and shorter hospitalization length (2 days vs 4.5 days; P = .0001) compared with the far-lateral approach. There was one complication of cervical instability in the far-lateral approach cohort. As an alternative to the far-lateral surgery, a minimally invasive approach resulted in shorter hospitalization (2 days) and less blood loss (10 mL) while avoiding the complication of cervical instability. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and durability of 3 surgical approaches for RVAS. Proper examination, preoperative imaging, and surgical planning were necessary for a satisfactory outcome.
