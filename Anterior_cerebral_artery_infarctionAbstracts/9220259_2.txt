Three patients with mesial frontal and extensive callosal lesions due to anterior cerebral artery infarction manifested an alien hand syndrome (AHS) with varied features. Patient 1 with left hemispheric lesion showed right hand's impulsive reaching and grasping and left hand's antagonistic movements to the right (intermanual conflict; IMC). Patients 2 and 3 with right hemispheric lesion manifested a left hemihypokinesia which was thought to have suppressed the frequency and amplitude or even the occurrence of left hand's reaching and grasping. IMC and other left hand's non-antagonistic, irrelevant movements to the right remained. Because the term "IMC" is often misused and not strictly defined, its association with right hand's reaching and grasping is quite uncommon, its significance as a sign of callosal disconnection is not well validated, and because left hand's reaching and grasping tend to be suppressed by motor neglect, a trend may then develop for the right hand to be the sole focus of pathological behaviour in patients with the so-called frontal AHS (Feinberg, Schindler, Flanagan et al., 1992).
