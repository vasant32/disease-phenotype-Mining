The viper is one of India's most commonly encountered poisonous snakes and envenomation following viper bite usually leads to consumption coagulopathy. Clinical manifestations most frequently include external and internal bleeding. In the setting of viper envenomation, large-vessel thrombosis is a very rare occurrence. Also, bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarction, when unrelated to anatomical abnormalities, subarachnoid haemorrhage, surgery or trauma, itself is an exceedingly rare event. We report a case of a 24-year-old previously healthy man who presented with bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarction following a viper bite. We also present hypotheses that may explain this unusual occurrence.
