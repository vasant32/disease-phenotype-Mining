<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of clinical signs in cases of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> includes not only focal neurological deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and mental disturbances, but also symptoms which may lead to a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033845" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pseudotumour cerebri</z:e> (PTC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 14 cases of angiographically (or autopsy) proven <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal or both lateral sinuses, the "empty triangle" sign on contrast CT examination was the most reliable sign, suggesting the diagnosis in 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect CT signs (venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients with focal neurological signs, but appeared rather delayed in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with "benign" intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or PTC (6 cases) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> unenhanced scans (4 cases) or showed slight diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain oedema</z:hpo> (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 4 patients with findings suggestive of intravascular coagulation; however, due to the complexity of flow phenomena, further studies employing this new imaging technique will first have to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, angiography remains the best diagnostic tool and should not be delayed if there is a clinical suspicion of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
