<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at different time points after <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the intracranial venous sinus, we have developed a new reversible superior sagittal sinus (SSS) model in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this new model, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by slow injections of the thrombogenic agent into the SSS using a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The success of SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was confirmed by magnetic resonance images (MRI), magnetic resonance venographs (MRV), and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted MRI and MRV were performed every week for 4 weeks to investigate the process of SSS occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and the surrounding tissue pathology, as well as endothelial cell injury following SSS occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SSS occlusion occurred at the beginning of the injection of the partial thromboplastin time reagent, and the occluded SSS reopened at the beginning of the second week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI images revealed that T2 signals were detected in the parieto-occipital lobes 24 h after SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and disappeared at the end of week two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During week two, the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> organization was evident and increased significantly in week three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> calcification was detected in week three and increased significantly in week four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy examination showed the damaged endothelial cell detected at week three following SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these findings suggest that this reversible SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model is feasible and reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occlusion state can be maintained for at least 4 weeks, providing an opportunity to study the mechanisms of SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
