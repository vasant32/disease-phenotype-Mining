<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An experimental method was devised of inducing SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the dog by use of double-lumen balloon catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two balloon catheters, introduced into each internal jugular vein, are finally positioned at the torcular Herophili </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting stasis in the SSS, initiated by the inflated balloons, is augmented by injecting thrombin into the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stasis and the intraluminal thrombin cause <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which can be visualized on computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method may be used to study the natural history of SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as well as establish its CT and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics </plain></SENT>
