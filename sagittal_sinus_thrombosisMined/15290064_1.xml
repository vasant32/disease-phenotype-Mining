<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were isointense on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images no matter what pulse sequence was used, except on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, which showed curvilinear sulcal hyperintensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On postcontrast T1-weighted images, curvilinearly enhancing structures were apparent in both frontal cortical sulci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No lesion appeared on follow-up CT or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We speculated that the areas of slightly increased attenuation in the cortices represented blood <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> in the cortical veins, venules and capillaries without serum leakage </plain></SENT>
