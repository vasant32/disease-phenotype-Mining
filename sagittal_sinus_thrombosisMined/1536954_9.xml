<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was diagnosed in the presence of (1) low fibrinogen (less than or equal to 160 mg/dL), (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0008151'>prolonged prothrombin time</z:hpo> (PT) and falling fibrinogen, or (3) prolonged PT and positive fibrin split products (FSP) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among adequately screened patients with ALL, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was detected in 7 of 58 (12%) before initiation of chemotherapy and in 35 of 45 (78%) during remission induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was not simply the result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> because clinical and laboratory signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were absent in 16 patients, whereas only 2 of the 22 febrile patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> had positive cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 38 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> at presentation or during remission induction, serious complications were seen in 13 in temporal association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> in one, sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in three, and serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in nine) and were major factors in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 patients with thorough screening but no evidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> there was only one <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> during the same time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with PCALL, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> was detected in 9% at presentation and in 80% during remission induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> is rare at presentation but common during remission induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> and PCALL and may be associated with significant thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest daily screening for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> during the first 14 days of remission induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> in ALL and PCALL should be a subject of future clinical studies </plain></SENT>
