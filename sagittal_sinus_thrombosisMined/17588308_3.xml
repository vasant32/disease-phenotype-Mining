<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the expression of VEGF in the rat DAVF model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were used in two experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 1 (n = 20, including sham-operated controls), VEGF expression was analysed by Western blots in three different rat DAVF models: model I: common carotid artery-external jugular vein (CCA-EJV) anastomosis (n = 5); model II: sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and bipolar coagulation of the vein draining the transverse sinus (n = 5); model III: CCA-EJV anastomosis and bipolar coagulation of the vein draining the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to induce venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of Experiment 1, Western blots were performed at weekly intervals 1, 2 and 3 weeks in Experiment 2 following induction of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in model III (n = 5 at each time point and n = 5 sham controls); in addition, VEGF expression was immunohistochemically examined in the dura and the brain near the occluded sinus in five model III animals after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In Experiment 1, Western blot analysis showed barely detectable bands with molecular weights of 45 kD, corresponding to VEGF, in the sham group, but the highest level of VEGF was induced in model III, followed by models I and II (model III&gt;model I&gt;model II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Experiment 2, the expression of VEGF peaked 1 week after induction of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in model III, decreasing in a linear fashion over 2 and 3 weeks (week 1&gt;weeks 2 and 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of immunoreactive VEGF was restricted in the connective tissue and the endothelial layer of the dura matter, cerebral cortical tissue and neurons of the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest a possible contribution of an angiogenic factor to the growth of DAVF </plain></SENT>
