<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison of Tc-RBC static images with dynamic flow studies in the brain showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 86%, and accuracy of 94% for static studies and values of 87%, 20%, and 61%, respectively, for the flow studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tc-RBC scintigraphy enables direct visualization of the integrity of the superior sagittal sinus, whereas CT scanning shows various but nonspecific changes in the brain associated with SSST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT study using Tc-RBC, performed in six patients, appears to have potential in the diagnosis of SSST, allowing separation of vascular structures that are superimposed on the superior sagittal sinus in planar scintigraphy study </plain></SENT>
