<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One infant died and the others had uneventful recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young infants with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rarely are seen for diagnostic imaging; the nonspecificity of the clinical presentation of this disorder and the difficulties with its investigation owing to the invasiveness of the radiologic procedures lead to its underdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging is a sensitive, noninvasive diagnostic modality, but it is not always available and practical for the very sick infants in the critical care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the cases described here, Doppler imaging proved to be diagnostic and useful in the management of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and should be used in the initial assessment of the condition, as it is the most convenient and least traumatic diagnostic modality </plain></SENT>
