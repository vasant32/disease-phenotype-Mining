<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, she was somnolent with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the left leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Precontrast computed tomography (CT) scans showed a high-density area in the left sylvian fissure and the posterior horn of the left lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographically, a right middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> and a basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, on the venous phase of bilateral carotid angiograms, superior sagittal sinus (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was probably induced by rupture of a dilated vein associated with SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, because high-density area on CT scan and location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was initially treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two months later, craniotomy was performed which did not disclose any trace of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234533" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">generalized convulsion</z:e> were induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient became ambulatory 5 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In SAH cases, the venous phase should be examined at least in one side of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In such a SAH case induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> it is very difficult to decide the timing of surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
