<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency of the sign and its prognostic significance, 76 reported cases (112 CT manifestations) of SST and SST-related intracranial sinovenous occlusive disease were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten CT signs related to both disease processes were reported; the empty delta sign was the most frequently reported sign (28.6%) of SST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with hemorrhagic infarction and/or the empty delta sign on CT scans had the poorest prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A case illustrative of the empty delta sign is described in which there was engorgement of endothelial- and nonendothelial-lined spaces in the dura mater with hemorrhagic rupture into the dural leaf </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The empty delta sign can probably be explained on the basis of the rich dural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous collateral circulation</z:e>, consisting primarily of lateral lacunae, a vascular mesh (dural cavernous spaces), and meningeal venous tributaries </plain></SENT>
