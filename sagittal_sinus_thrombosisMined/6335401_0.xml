<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were assigned to three groups based on the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and their intracranial pressure level: the first group comprised 23 patients with high intracranial pressure and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, resulting from supratentorial <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp>, benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; the second group included 22 patients with either high intracranial pressure or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, resulting from intracranial aneurysmal rupture: and the third group was composed of 12 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intracranial pressure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001334'>communicating hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, resulting from intracranial aneurysmal rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plateau waves in the first group patients were characterized as large plateau like formations recurring at varying intervals, with a height of 50-100 mmHg and a duration of 10 to 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plateau waves in the second group patients had a height of 20 to 60 mmHg and a duration of 3 to 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The waves in the second group patients were smaller in amplitude and shorter in duration as compared with the waves in the first group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plateau waves in the third group patients had an amplitude of 15 to 40 mm Hg and a duration of 3 to 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were the smallest in amplitude and the shortest in duration as compared with the plateau waves seen in the first and the second group patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
