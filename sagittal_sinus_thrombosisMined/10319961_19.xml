<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of bilateral transverse and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was made and the patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an initial period of improvement, she became <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> and hemiplegic 8 days after presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, we performed angiography and transfemoral venous thrombolysis with a hydrodynamic thrombectomy catheter, followed by intrasinus urokinase thrombolytic therapy over the course of 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique resulted in dramatic sinus thrombolysis and near total neurologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six months after treatment, the patient showed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and no focal neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary experience suggests that this technique may play a significant role in the endovascular treatment of this potentially devastating disease </plain></SENT>
