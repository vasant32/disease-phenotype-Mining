<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 47 admissions for life threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> to the PICU over this period, representing about 2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> admissions to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of symptoms in these patients before admission was 54 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 55% of the PICU admissions had received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35523">bronchodilators</z:chebi> before coming to our hospital emergency room from where they were admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From arterial blood gas analysis, 57% of the patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (PaCO2 &gt; 45 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients received nebulized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2549">salbutamol</z:chebi> frequently as well as intravenous aminophylline and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
