<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the initial presentation, there was increased regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the left frontal and parietal lobes with moderately increased rCBV in the right parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the occluded sinus resulted in a normalization of elevated rCBV in the frontal and parietal lobes and improvements of rCBF and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen in the occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy was accompanied by restoration of cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism, although magnetic resonance venography showed only partial recanalization of the occluded sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET evaluation of the cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism may be of value in gaining further insight into pathophysiological characteristics of human cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
