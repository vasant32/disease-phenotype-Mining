<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurring as a rare complication of neck dissection, and to present a review of published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old man underwent an elective neck dissection for a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> stage 2, node stage 2b, tonsillar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, prior to chemoradiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During surgery, the right internal jugular vein was sacrificed as part of the resection, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> was adherent to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after surgery, the patient was readmitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent computed tomography and magnetic resonance venography confirmed a superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was subsequently anticoagulated and underwent radiotherapy without further complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A review of pre-operative imaging indicated a dominant internal jugular vein, ligation of which may have been a factor in the subsequent sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following neck dissection is a rare occurrence, with little reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dominant internal jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> may be evident on pre-operative imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An awareness of this complication may be helpful to surgeons contemplating sacrifice of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
