<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although coagulation disturbances are reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, a direct link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is not established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 39-year-old man who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging showed SSST, and laboratory studies were consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other causes of a hypercoaguable state were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prompt treatment of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> led to recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus and a full neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the known effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> on factor VIII activity, we hypothesize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for SSST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high index of suspicion for SSST is warranted in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, thyroid dysfunction should be excluded in patients with unexplained SSST </plain></SENT>
