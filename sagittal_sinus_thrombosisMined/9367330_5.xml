<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the ability of transtemporal power- and frequency-based transcranial color-coded duplex sonography to aid in the assessment of cerebral veins and sinuses, as well as to provide reference data for flow direction and velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using a color duplex device equipped with a 2.0/2.5-MHz sector scan, we insonated 120 healthy volunteers and three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In subjects 20 to 59 years old, deep middle cerebral veins were identified in 88%, basal veins in 97%, straight sinuses in 60%, and transverse sinuses in 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding values for subjects 60 to 79 years old were 53%, 86%, 23%, and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Velocities were highest in transverse and straight sinuses, slower in basal veins, and slowest in deep middle cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow was directed lateromedially in the deep middle cerebral vein, rostrocaudally in the basal vein and straight sinus, and mediolaterally in the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with straight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037198" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sinus thromboses</z:e> showed reversed flow direction in the basal veins, and one patient with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> showed elevated velocities in a deep middle cerebral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transtemporal power- and frequency-based color-coded duplex sonography enabled imaging and velocity measurements in deep cerebral veins in subjects 20 to 59 years old, but detection of the straight and transverse sinuses was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In older subjects, only the basal vein was regularly assessed </plain></SENT>
