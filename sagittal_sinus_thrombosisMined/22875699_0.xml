<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>KFD remains a poorly defined disease, and no clear diagnostic criteria are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assess the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic findings of KFD cases and report two unusual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty KFD patients that underwent lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) biopsy and diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining, from January 2003 to November 2010, were enrolled in this retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients had a mean age of 29.3 years, and 29 (72.5 %) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LNs</z:e> were mainly located unilaterally in the cervical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> size was 15.3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight (70 %) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> tenderness, and 25 (62.5 %) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo> was observed in 18 of 35 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-nuclear antibody was positive in four of 19 evaluable patients, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had been diagnosed with concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, the 40 cases were classified into three types, that is, as proliferative (37.5 %), necrotizing (55.0 %), or xanthomatous (7.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interesting cases: Case 1 was a 35-year-old female with KFD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a 47-year-old male with KFD and bone marrow involvement and presented with severe bicytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although KFD is an uncommon self-limited benign disorder, it must be included in the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is important that the clinical features of KFD be understood to reach a correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
