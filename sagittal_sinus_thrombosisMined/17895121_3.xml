<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, information regarding safety in the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> is sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Three patients presented with severe, progressive focal neurological symptoms (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scales: 14, 22, and 12) resulting from superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on computed tomographic scans (two intraparenchymal, one subarachnoid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective venous catheterization was performed and low-dose urokinase was delivered directly into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> by continuous infusion at 60,000 U/h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was administered concurrently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: Angiographic patency was restored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total duration of urokinase infusion ranged from 36 to 84 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no major morbidity or mortality related to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had dramatic clinical improvement during and after the course of therapy, and none had worsening of pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were independent at 3 months, with minimal or no deficit (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scales: 2, 0, and 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: In selected patients with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with venous hemorrhagic infarction, urokinase appears to be safe and may reverse progressive neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future prospective study is warranted to further investigate this treatment option, and patients with severe deficits or pre-existing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> should not be excluded </plain></SENT>
