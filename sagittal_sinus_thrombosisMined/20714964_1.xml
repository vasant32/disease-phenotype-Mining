<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CVT has been reported to be associated with various etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are, however, very few reported cases of CVT associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (IDA), especially in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We reported the case of a female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic infarction due to sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004840'>hypochromic microcytic anemia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>, and had a good prognosis after iron supplementation and oral anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present case indicates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> is a risk factor for CVT </plain></SENT>
