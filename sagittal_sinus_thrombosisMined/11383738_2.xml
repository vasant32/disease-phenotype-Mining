<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The application of a laser scanning technique to measure regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygenation (HbO2) using the rat closed cranial window preparation is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine male Wistar rats were used to consecutively measure local CBF by laser Doppler flowmetry and tissue HbO2 by a microspectrophotometric method at multiple corresponding cortical locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The scanning technique used a computer-controlled micromanipulator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from three experimental models are presented: the whisker stimulation model, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion model, and the sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequential changes in local CBF and HbO2 data before, during, and after stimulation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from predefined locations within the same region were correlated with the topographical location and then arranged in a three-dimensional image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the whisker stimulation model, we found a disproportionate increase in CBF (32 +/- 12%) as compared with that of HbO2 (9 +/- 4%) during stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion model, the three-dimensional image showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> low CBF (depending on the area) and homogeneous HbO2 at a reduced level during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and postischemic hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the range of oxygenation was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the sinus-vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, drainage of the unsaturated blood via the collateral pathways was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The laser scanning technique is useful for visualizing sequential changes in hemodynamic-metabolic interactions of cortical brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This technique can reveal phenomena not detected by traditional monitoring procedures </plain></SENT>
