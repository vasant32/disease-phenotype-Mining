<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An abnormal protein S (PS) was found in a Japanese family with a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband is a woman who was born in Tokushima Prefecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the left leg, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the placenta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma level of free PS antigen but decreased PS activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her mother and aunt also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the leg, and together with four other family members also showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level but decreased activity of PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that hereditary dysfunction of PS is inherited in this family as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband's PS appears to have a slightly higher molecular weight than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PS both in the intact and modified form, suggesting that it has a molecular defect on the carboxyl-terminal side of the thrombin-sensitive site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This abnormal PS with apparently unique characteristics was named PS Tokushima </plain></SENT>
