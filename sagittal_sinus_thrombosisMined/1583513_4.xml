<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were studied with serial examinations up to 15 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 70 CSF hydrodynamic examinations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A clear increase in intracranial pressure due to raised pressure in the major dural sinus was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A striking feature was the persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial pressure increase</z:e> that declined only gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This had no obvious clinical impact </plain></SENT>
