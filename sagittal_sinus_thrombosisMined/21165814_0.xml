<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the case of a full-term, seven week old male infant who was exclusively breast-fed but who developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004906'>hypernatremic dehydration</z:hpo> as a result of declined breast milk volume that was not recognized by the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to prevent serious therapy-associated side effects due to rapid rehydration, we performed a rehydration regime providing a slow decrease of serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> levels by carefully infusing hypertonic saline solution </plain></SENT>
