<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with cerebral sinus and cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> develop venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in approximately 50% of cases, resulting in serious clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An animal model is needed to further clarify the underlying mechanisms and consequences surrounding cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, particularly for severe ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to develop a new superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model involving cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The superior sagittal sinus was exposed and ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A microcatheter was inserted into the sinus, then both common carotid arteries were temporary occluded to reduce cerebral blood flow, and thrombin was injected into the sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, after evaluating neurological function and obtaining an MRI, animals were sacrificed and data pertaining to brain water content, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and tissue histology was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction, when present, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> were observed in the brain parenchyma of the parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was 59%, which is similar to that seen clinically in patients with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo>, as measured by brain water content percentage, was significantly increased in thrombosed animals compared to sham-operated animals (80.8 ± 0.55% vs. 78.8 ± 0.14%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were 53.02 ± 7.91 mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We suggest that our modified model of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, involving cortical veins, is suitable for the study of its underlying mechanisms, as well as therapeutic approaches directed at the disease </plain></SENT>
