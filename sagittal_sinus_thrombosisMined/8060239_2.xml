<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He developed focal neurologic signs on hospital day 4, and a computed tomographic scan of his head showed a right medial temporal lobe hyperdensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before diagnosis could be made or treatment started, the patient was unexpectedly found dead on hospital day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, a primary central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system B-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521815" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">immunoblastic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was found involving both hippocampi and other periventricular areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associated angiodestruction and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with local vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was extensive, partial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus and distal superficial cortical veins unassociated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or infarction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or involvement with opportunistic organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retrospective review of radiographic studies demonstrated the classic "empty delta" sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, cerebral venous and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has not been well documented in patients with the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because the dural venous sinuses are not routinely examined at autopsy in many institutions, cerebral venous/dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients with the acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome may be more frequent than is presently recognized </plain></SENT>
