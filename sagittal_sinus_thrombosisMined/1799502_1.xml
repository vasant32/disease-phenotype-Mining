<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial mass</z:e> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> is observed in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the pathogenesis of this syndrome has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case of 36-year-old female diagnosed as benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, who has developed superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and dural AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> during the follow up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was pointed out to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> six years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although she was examined by both DSA and CT scan, no abnormal intracranial lesions were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consequently, she was diagnosed as the benign intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and had been followed as an out patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three years later, lumboperitoneal shunting was performed because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient had been well for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently, occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> recurred and she was readmitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI studies demonstrated dilated vessels in the right occipital area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additionally, angiograms revealed not only the superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> but also the rich network of dural AV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> adjacent to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>According to those results, the superior sagittal sinus was supposed to have the incomplete occlusion or delayed blood flow that were not observed by DSA, MRI and CT scan performed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Those occlusive change in the superior sagittal sinus impeded the CSF absorption and elevated the pressure of venous inflow, then the arterio-venous communication has been developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
