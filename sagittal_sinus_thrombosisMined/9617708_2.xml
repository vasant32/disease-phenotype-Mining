<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested the usefulness of this method in two cases with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that showed increased velocities of deep cerebral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the deep intracranial venous circulation in patients with that pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous transcranial Doppler ultrasound was performed with a range-gated 2 MHz transducer in 17 healthy volunteers and in six cases of proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic, end diastolic and mean blood flow velocities were measured in the basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR) and deep middle cerebral vein (DMCV) through a posterior temporal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 16 controls and in one patient, the straight sinus was also studied through an occipital approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sex distribution and mean age of controls and patients were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean blood flow velocities in controls were as follows (mean, SD): DMCV, 10.4, 1.4 cm/s; BVR, 11.3, 1.8 cm/s; straight sinus, 29.5, 9.9 cm/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients with superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> showed increased velocities either in the DMCV, the BVR or the straight sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient showed slightly increased velocities in the BVR, and the other two showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous velocity values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the usefulness of conventional transcranial Doppler ultrasound in detecting superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> examination does not exclude this diagnosis </plain></SENT>
