<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This resulted in extensive multifocal hemorrhagic venous infarction and severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> refractory to intensive management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy using a rheolytic catheter device in combination with a small amount of fibrinolytic agent led to rapid normalization of the intracranial pressure, allowing optimization of the cerebral perfusion pressures and was followed by steady, albeit protracted, clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
