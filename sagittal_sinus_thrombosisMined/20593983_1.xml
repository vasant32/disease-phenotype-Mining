<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> resulting from compression of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) by an overlying depressed calvarial fracture is a rare condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary surgical treatment for the symptomatic patient in this setting traditionally involves elevation of the fracture, which often carries significant associated morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors report a case involving a 6-year-old boy who suffered a closed, depressed, parietooccipital fracture as the result of an unhelmeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-terrain vehicle accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This fracture caused compression and subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the SSS, which resulted in CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0002024'>malabsorption</z:hpo> and progressive intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> free following the injury, he had developed severe and unremitting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> by postinjury Day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A CT angiography study of the head obtained at this time exhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the SSS underlying the depressed calvarial fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent lumbar puncture demonstrated markedly elevated intrathecal pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large volumes of CSF were removed, with temporary improvement in symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After medical management with anticoagulation failed, the decision was made to proceed with image-guided ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> resolved immediately following the procedure, and anticoagulation therapy was reinstituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up images obtained 4 months after the injury demonstrated evidence of resolution of the depressed fracture, with recanalization of the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The anticoagulation therapy was then discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, this report is the first description of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion as the primary treatment of this infrequent condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that select patients with this presentation can undergo CSF diversion in lieu of elevation of the depressed skull fracture-a surgical procedure shown to be associated with increased risks when the depressed fracture overlies the posterior SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The literature on this topic is reviewed and management of this condition is discussed </plain></SENT>
