<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included children who underwent diagnostic imaging at the Omar Bongo Ondimba military hospital between January 2006 and December 2010 and treatment of cranioencephalic complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 58 children were hospitalized with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, and eight (13.8%) had cranioencephalic complications for an annual incidence of 1.6% and a sex ratio of 5 boys to 3 girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms developed over a mean duration of 14 days (range: 3-45 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture was dominated by febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and neurologic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Palpation of the sinus pressure points was painful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disorders of consciousness were found in five cases, with a mean Glasgow score of 9 (range: 7-13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven children had multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> and one frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five children had a subdural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_609'>empyema</z:mpath>, two associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the sagittal sinus, one with a brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the sagittal sinus, and another with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> of the sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> of the frontal sinus table, including a frontal lobe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> for one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another had multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral abscesses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five children had sinus and neurosurgical drainage, two sinus drainage only, and one neurosurgical drainage only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microbiology was positive for microbes in four cases: Streptococcus eqinus (one case), Staphylococcus aureus (one case), both S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (one case), and Aerococcus viridans (one case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Outcome was favourable in seven cases, including four without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two children had recurrences, and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of the cranioencephalic complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> rely on medical imagery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Early multidisciplinary therapeutic management is essential </plain></SENT>
