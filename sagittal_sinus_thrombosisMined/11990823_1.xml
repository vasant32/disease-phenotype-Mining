<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present the case of a 69-year-old man who suffered from bilateral cortical venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> due to a brain pial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) with a high-flow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> became complicated by the development of a high-grade stenosis of the posterior superior sagittal sinus (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison of cerebral angiograms obtained at different times revealed that the severe SSS stenosis had developed within a 5-year period and was located distal to the nidus of the left parietal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> nidus, away from the entrance of the dominant superior superficial cortical draining vein into the SSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high-flow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was occluded with detachable coils and the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> nidus was further embolized with acrylic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SSS stenosis was mechanically dilated by means of balloon angioplasty and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case provides angiographic evidence to support the hypothesis that a pial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> in an adult can cause high-flow occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venopathy</z:e> in a major sinus within a relatively short time and that this acquired high-flow occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venopathy</z:e> can develop at an atypical location distant from the nidus of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
