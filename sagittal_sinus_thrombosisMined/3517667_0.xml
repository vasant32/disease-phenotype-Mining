<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Representative angiograms have been presented in 3 cases (one of occlusive cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advantages of this method are simple procedure, easy puncture with little carotid injury and almost none of patient's complaints accompanied by dye-injection </plain></SENT>
