<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective cross-sectional study, measurements of the fetal sinus sagittalis were obtained in patients undergoing elective fetal anatomical surveys or fetal growth scan at between 16.6 and 34.7 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Special attention was given to the SSS of the fetal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the coronal plane, the SSS may be easily identified immediately below the frontal bone, and anterior to the fetal head parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 206 fetuses were scanned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A regression line of the SSS was created throughout gestation and a first-degree correlation was found between gestational age (GA) and the SSS height (r = 0.418; p &lt; 0.0001; SSS = -0.015 + 0.0178 Ã— GA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values were established for different gestational weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We provide ultrasonographic dimensions of the fetal SSS across pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This data potentially allows for prenatal diagnosis of abnormal appearance of the SSS </plain></SENT>
