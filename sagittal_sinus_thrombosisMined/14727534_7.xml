<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental evidence suggested a role of angiogenic growth factors in the genesis of vascular malformations of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the pathogenesis of DAVF, we examined the expression of the angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in rat DAVF model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats (weighting 280 to 300 g, n = 40) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each rat was mounted on a stereotaxic frame under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DAVF model (Spetzler et al.) was made by common carotid artery-external jugular vein anastomosis, bipolar coagulation of the vein draining the transverse sinus, and superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (SSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SSS was thrombosed by a hemostatic agent through 16-gauge needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was induced in 30 rats, which were divided into two experimental groups; (1) immunohistological study group (n = 15) and (2) angiography group (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological analysis was performed by VEGF antibody 1 week after, and angiography was done 90 days after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Developing of angiographical DAVF was observed with the magnifying X-ray camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each 5 rats served as sham-operated controls, which received a similar surgery without induction of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEGF expression and DAVF were not observed in sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In immunohistological study group, VEGF expression in the endothelium and the connective tissues of the dura mater in the five rats (33%) and in the neurons in the eleven rats (73%) of the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In angiography group, DAVF formed in 6 among 15 rats (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide the first experimental evidence that angiogenic growth factors VEGF may participate in the genesis of DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a novel strategy for the management and prevention of DAVF and related disorders </plain></SENT>
