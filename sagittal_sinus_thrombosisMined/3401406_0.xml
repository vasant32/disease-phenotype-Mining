<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 61-year-old man with two days history of intermittent right hemiconvulsion followed by post-ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>erythrocytosis</z:hpo> was noted on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scans revealed left frontal hemorrhagic infarction with empty delta sign in the middle portion of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram showed occlusion of two frontal cortical veins and retrograde filling of these veins into the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lack of filling of the middle and anterior part of the superior sagittal sinus was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies led to the diagnosis of superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was treated with intravenous infusion of low molecular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and venesection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, urokinase, hyperosmolar solutions nor steroids were used because of the presence of hemorrhagic infarction and of the lack of signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He completely recovered neurologically and recanalization of the superior sagittal sinus was confirmed angiographically eight weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images were taken with a Siemens 1.5 T Magnetom scanner using spin-echo pulse sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A T 1-weighted mid-sagittal magnetic resonance image ten days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed hyperintensity in the middle part of the superior sagittal sinus which corresponded to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both T 1 and T 2 weighted coronal images revealed a small area of hypointensity indicating the existence of residual blood flow in the superior sagittal sinus in addition to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> both in the sinus and in the cortical vein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
