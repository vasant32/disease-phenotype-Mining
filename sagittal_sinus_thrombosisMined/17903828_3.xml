<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPL) other than anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) is not well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report the distribution of aCL, antiphosphatidylethanolamine (aPE), and antiphosphatidylserine (aPS) aPL among patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease evaluated by our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Service at Indiana University Hospital from January 1997 to November 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records from 1997 to 1999 at Indiana University Hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9) codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified patients with elevated titers of aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sera from these patients were obtained within the first 30 days of the index event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We included only those patients for whom the serum samples were tested in a single laboratory by an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) aCL, aPE, and aPS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the clinical presentation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatologic disorders</z:e>, and distribution of aPL specificity and isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four of 185 patients, 26 women (76%), with a mean age of 46 years, and 8 men (24%) with a mean age of 46 years, had aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), 25 suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 23 had ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and 2 had hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (1 had a superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with bilateral hemispheric hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and one had bilateral hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> [SLE]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors were cigarette smoking (38%) and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately two thirds (60%) of patients had a single positive aPL finding: aPE in 35%, aCL in 18%, and aPS in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple specificities were seen in 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IgA was the only aPL antibody isotype detected in 26% of the patients, IgG was the lone isotype in 24%, and IgM alone in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multiple aPL isotypes were detected in 38% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five patients (15%) presented with aPE IgA as the exclusive aPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our series, aPE was the most frequent finding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who were suspected to have an associated aPL syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These specific types of aPL may be present relatively often in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and are often not assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine how specific these aPL are in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> versus other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> illnesses and versus healthy controls, and how these aPL are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
