The 17 cases of sudden deafness in children and juveniles treated in the HNO-Universit√§ts-Klinik Erlangen between August 1977 and December 1980 are analyzed and correlations of symptoms and possible etiologies are discussed. There is no unique clinical picture. Vascular reasons do not play an important role contrary to adult patients. Unexpectedly viral infections are not of great importance. Young patients who had a sensorineural hearing loss prior to the sudden deafness seem to have a bad prognosis for therapy. Vestibular involvement seems to be of no meaning for a successful therapy in children and juveniles.
