The work is based on an analysis of results of 70 carotid endarterectomies performed on 68 patients aged from 43 to 67 years. 53% of the patients were operated upon at the stage of a relative compensation of brain blood circulation. Multiple character of injuries of the brachiocephalic arteries took place in 70.5% of the cases. Plasty of the internal carotid artery is thought by the authors to be necessary by means of using a flap of lyophylized allopericardium, with the diameter of its orifice less than 8 mm.
