85 carotid endarterectomies were performed by the vascular unit at the Princess Alexandra Public Hospital between 1 July 1973 and 30 June 1978. The case histories of the patients undergoing the procedure were studied and the immediate mortality and morbidity associated with the procedure during the period were determined. 1 patient died following the procedure and 3.6% of operations resulted in a completed stroke. The indication for the operation, the referral source and the neurological condition of the patient undergoing the procedure were categorised in an attempt to determine the factors governing the selection of patients for this procedure. Excluding asymptomatic lesions, more than two-thirds of the operations were performed later than 2 weeks after the time of first referral to the hospital. Half the operations were performed after a delay of more than 1 month.
