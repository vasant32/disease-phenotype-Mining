A recent case of bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis encountered by the authors prompted a review of the literature on this subject. The lesion is compatible with, if not a normal life, at least prolonged survival, owing to the development of collateral circulation, which until the onset of thrombosis is of negligible proportions. The prognosis, although poor, may nonetheless be improved in future years if the practice is adopted of investigating the patient completely upon the appearance of the slightest symptoms. This may lead to early diagnosis and perhaps to better treatment results.
