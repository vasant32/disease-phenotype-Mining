A new dual isotope scintigraphic (DISC) examination of the carotid arteries consisting of simultaneous injections of 111In-labeled platelets and 99mTc-labeled red cells was performed on eight male patients suffering from amaurosis fugax attacks. In concordance with the angiographically proven high percentage of significant extracranial carotid disease in patients with amaurosis fugax, six of the eight patients examined had an increased platelet accumulation in the carotid artery clinically affected. In one patient with normal angiography and one amaurosis fugax attack the platelet scintigraphy even revealed a pathological platelet accumulation in the ipsilateral carotid artery. These findings confirm the hypothesis that most amaurosis fugax attacks are due to arterio-arterial emboli originating from atherosclerotic plaques of the carotid bifurcation.
