Thrombotic occlusions of the cerebral arteries are in a high degree participating in the development of cerebral infarction. Their treatment is problematic because the use of thrombolytics may be detrimental to the cerebral tissue. In many cases, these thromboses cannot be reached surgically. Suitable animal models are necessary for achieving advances in this acute life-threatening disease. An animal-experimental model of a thrombosis of the arteria carotis interna is presented. For producing a coagulative thrombosis, autologous blood is used after previous electric activation in vitro which after re-injection behaves like a thrombogenic substance.
