We studied the antithrombotic and thrombolytic effects of Trombovazim, a highly-purified proteolytic enzyme preparation obtained by immobilization of bacterial proteinases (Bacillus) on polyethylene oxide with a molecular weight of 1.5 kDa. Blood absorption of the preparation was evaluated after intragastric administration. In vitro experiments showed that Trombovazim produces anticoagulant and thrombolytic effects, which manifested in inhibition of fibrin clot formation and acceleration of its lysis. Drug concentration in the blood was elevated from the 4th to the 7th hour after intragastric administration of Trombovazim in a dose of 2250 U/kg, being maximum by the 5th hour (0.044+/-0.011 U/ml). Course treatment with Trombovazim (1000 U intragastrically, twice daily for 3 days) had a thrombolytic effect on rats with experimental intravascular thrombosis. This effect was manifested in a decrease in thrombus weight and increase in the percent of rats with recanalization of the occluded carotid artery.
