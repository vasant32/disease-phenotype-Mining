Cases of internal carotid artery occlusion associated with an intracranial tumor are rare. The authors report two cases of complete occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In one case the thrombosis was probably caused by direct compression of the carotid siphon by a large meningioma arising from the inner third of the sphenoid wing. In the other it was associated with multiple meningiomatosis although there was no contiguity between the intracranial tumors and the occluded carotid artery. After a review of literature we think they are of some interest, and we have found an interesting incidence of association between thrombosis and meningioma.
