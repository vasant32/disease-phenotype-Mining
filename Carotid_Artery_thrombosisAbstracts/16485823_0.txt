The paper describes a relatively rare clinical case of stepwise surgical treatment in a patient with concomitant cerebrovascular pathology: thrombosis of the left internal carotid artery + critical stenosis of the right internal carotid artery + arteriovenous malformation of the right occipital lobe. The patient underwent open right carotid endarterectomy left extra-intracranial microvascular anastomotic application, and histoacryl endovascular embolization of the major afferents and arteriovenous malformation stroma in the stepwise fashion. Management policy, possible complications, and ways of their prevention in these patients are discussed.
