 BACKGROUND: Cerebral infarction (CI), myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and aortic atheroma are the main clinical manifestations of atherothrombosis. Long-term prevention after CI of atherothrombotic origin may require preventive measures at other sites, such as specific drug therapies, surgery, or angioplasty. Therefore the detection of other locations is potentially important. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to describe the other locations of atherothrombosis in patients hospitalized for a recent cerebral infarct of atherothrombotic origin. Secondary objectives were to describe their vascular risk factor profiles, and their management before and after the cerebral event. METHOD: This prospective, observational, multicenter survey was conducted in France between September 2003 and July 2004, mainly in neurological departments and stroke units. RESULTS: 753 patients were included (74% men; mean age 69.3 years). Previous coronary events had occurred in 119 (16%). Previous stroke or transient ischemic attacks had occurred in 233 (31%). PAD was already known in 109 (15%). A search for other atherothrombotic locations was positive in 216 patients (29%). The minimum prevalence for any associated atherothrombotic location (either present before or identified during hospitalization) was 47.5% for any location, 33.7% for coronary artery disease, 16.6% for aortic atheroma, and 22.7% for PAD. CONCLUSION: Fifty percent of the patients with recent atherothrombotic CI have other locations of atherothrombosis. For this reason, a systematic search for these other locations is recommended because of the possible therapeutic consequences. However, the question of the most appropriate period for this search after the cerebral event remains unsettled.
