We report a case of bilateral asymptomatic rebeosis iridis related to a bilateral obstruction of the carotid arteries. The iridocorneal angles were closed by a neovascular membrane and intraocular pressures were normal within both eyes (normotensive neovascular glaucoma). After left carotid endarterectomy, the increased perfusion of the ciliary body and the increased secretion of aqueous humor resulted in a sudden bilateral ocular hypertension. Management of ocular neovascularization related to carotid artery obstruction may involve the destruction of areas of retinal ishchemia (laser panretinal photocoagulation or cryotherapy) before carotid surgery.
