60 patients under 65 years of age with one or more episodes of reversible ischemic attacks lasting less or more than 24 hours (T.I.A. or R.I.N.D.) were studied. Each patient had a complete clinical assessment and an EEG, followed by an arteriogram. 35 patients had an EEG activation with digital carotid compression. EEG abnormalities were present in 26 cases while 34 patients had normal records. No correlation was found between EEG abnormalities and arteriographic alterations. EEG activation by digital carotid compression is a valuable hemodynamic test but cannot necessarily indicate a controlateral carotid artery occlusion.
