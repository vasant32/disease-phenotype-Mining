BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute thromboembolic stroke complicated by ipsilateral carotid occlusion may present both mechanical and inflow-related barriers to effective intracranial thrombolysis. We sought to review our experience with a novel method of mechanical thrombectomy, in such cases, using the Possis AngioJet system, a rheolytic thrombectomy device. METHODS: A review of our interventional neuroradiology database revealed three patients in whom an occluded cervical internal carotid artery was encountered during endovascular treatment for acute stroke and in whom thrombectomy was attempted, using the 5F Possis AngioJet thrombectomy catheter. The medical records and radiographic studies of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Three patients were identified (ages, 52--84 years). Two patients had isolated occlusion of the internal carotid artery; in one patient, thrombus extended down into the common carotid artery. Treatment was initiated within 190 to 360 minutes of stroke onset. Thrombectomy of the carotid artery was deemed necessary because of poor collateral flow to the affected hemisphere (chronic contralateral internal carotid artery occlusion [one patient] and thrombus extending to the carotid "T" [one patient]) or inability to pass a microcatheter through the occluded vessel (one patient). Adjunctive therapy included pharmacologic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (all patients), carotid angioplasty and stenting (two patients), and middle cerebral artery angioplasty (one patient). Patency of the carotid artery was reestablished in two patients, with some residual thrombus burden. In the third patient, the device was able to create a channel through the column of thrombus, allowing intracranial access. CONCLUSION: Rheolytic thrombectomy shows potential for rapid, large-burden thrombus removal in cases of internal carotid artery thrombosis, allowing expedient access to the intracranial circulation for additional thrombolytic therapy.
