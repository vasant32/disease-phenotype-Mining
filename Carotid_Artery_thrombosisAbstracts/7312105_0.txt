In 60 patients with arteriographically confirmed changes in extracranial arteries EEG investigations were carried out. In 15 of them surgical interventions were performed for restoring the patency of the involved artery. EEG curves were studied for finding abnormalities in cases of changes in definite groups of arteries (internal carotid, arteries of the aortic arch), and correlations were sought for between the extent of thrombosis and EEG curves. In the patients treated surgically EEG curves were compared before and after the operation. The author concludes that changes limited to the internal carotid artery lying which is situated nearer to the head can produce larger foci of cerebral ischaemia and greater intensity of EEG changes. In the surgically treated patients EEG records were improved after the operation in most cases, which shows that restoration of arterial patency exerts a favourable effect on the cerebral circulation evidenced in EEG improvement.
