The authors report two cases of post-traumatic occlusions of the internal carotid artery, located at the level of emergence or just above the emergence of this artery out of the cavernous sinus. Comparing those two cases with five others reported in the litterature, the authors try to explain their mechanisms of occlusion : thrombosis or embolism.
