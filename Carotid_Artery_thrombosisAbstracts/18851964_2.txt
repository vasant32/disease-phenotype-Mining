Edaravone is a lipophilic drug with multiple mechanisms of action. Because edaravone is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of stroke, we tested the hypothesis that edaravone would be neuroprotective following cerebral ischemia using a rabbit embolic stroke model with a well-defined behavioral endpoint. Using the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM), a drug or drug combination is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the amount of microclots (mg) measured in brain that produce neurologic dysfunction in 50% of a group of animals (P(50)) compared to the control group. Edaravone (100 mg/kg, s.c.), increased the P(50) value to 1.80+/-0.24 mg (p<0.05) when administered 5 min following embolization and increased P(50) values by 195% and 161% (compared to control) when administered 1 and 3 h following embolization, respectively, but was inactive when applied 6 h following embolization, compared to the cumulative control group (P(50)=0.93+/-0.16 mg). To simulate the design of current clinical trials, edaravone was also given following a standard tPA regimen, which by itself increased the P(50) value to 2.72+/-0.28 mg. When tPA was infused 1 h following embolization and edaravone was given 3 h following embolization, the P(50) was 2.68+/-0.56 mg. This study indicates that edaravone may have substantial therapeutic benefit for the treatment of AIS since it had a therapeutic widow of at least 3 h in rabbits. Edaravone can also be administered with a thrombolytic to improve behavior.
