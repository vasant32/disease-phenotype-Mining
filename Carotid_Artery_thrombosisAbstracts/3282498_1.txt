Egas Moniz discovered cerebral angiography in 1927 and introduced leukotomy as a form of treatment of mental illness, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1949. His work on occlusive cerebrovascular disease is less known. In 1937 he originally described internal carotid occlusion as documented by angiography. His observations and comments on the clinical, pathogenic, and therapeutic aspects of internal carotid thrombosis are reviewed.
