Giant intra and parasellar aneurysm with a spontaneous thrombosis of internal carotid artery is rare. We report the case of a 34 years old woman presenting a unique giant sellar and parasellar aneurysm associated with hypopituitarism and amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome. Computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images were suggestive of a sellar tumor with a cystic component. Digital cerebral angiography showed spontaneous thrombosis of a intrasellar and parasellar carotid artery aneurysm and left internal carotid artery in the neck. A transseptal endoscopic biopsy was done and confirmed a thrombosed aneurysm. No other surgical treatment was required in this patient but permanent endocrinological treatment was necessary.
