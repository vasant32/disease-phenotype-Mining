Angiographic and Doppler-sonographic findings from a patient suffering from a traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula are presented. Data were obtained before, during, and after occlusion of the fistula by means of a balloon catheter. Doppler examination of the periorbital vessels and the carotid arteries in the neck region (selective for the common, internal, and external carotid arteries) allows a reliable and atraumatic evaluation of the carotid circulation and the pathologic venous drainage of the fistula by the orbital veins. The proper positioning of the balloon therefore is facilitated by simultaneous Doppler recording of the pathologic venous flow. The balloon-catheter technique described by Prolo et al. (1971) was modified and lead to a complete occlusion of the fistula without causing a carotid thrombosis.
