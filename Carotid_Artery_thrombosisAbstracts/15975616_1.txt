Effects of scorpion venom active polypeptide (SVAP) from scorpion venom of Buthus Martensii Karsch of Chinese on platelet aggregation in ex vivo and vitro in rabbits, thrombosis in carotid artery of rats and plasma 6-keto-PG F1alpha and TXB2 in rats were studied by the turbidimetry, the duplicated thrombosis model by electrostimulation and RIA, respectively. The results showed that SVAP 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 mg/ml inhibited significantly the rabbit platelet aggregation triggered by 0.3 U/ml thrombin, 10 microM ADP in vitro (P<0.05 or 0.01) and SVAP at the dose of 0.32, 0.64 mg/kg iv prolonged distinctively the occlusion time of thrombosis that were induced by electrical stimulation. Increased% of 0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg were 30.16, 71.74, 98.27%, respectively, which showed a good dose-effect relationship. SVAP 0.22 mg/ml (in vitro) or 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg (in ex vivo) could obviously increase the plasma concentration of 6-keto-PG F1alpha, but slightly effect rats plasma concentration of TXB2 in vitro and in ex vivo and significantly increase of value of PG I2/TXA2, which suggested that the mechanism of the antithrombotic action of SVAP is related to the resistance against platelet aggregation, increase of the concentration of PG I2 in plasma.
