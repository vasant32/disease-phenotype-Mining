The identification of intraplaque hemorrhage with high resolution gray scale ultrasound imaging has been shown to be achievable by those using appropriate technique and attention to detail. Plaque can be classified as either heterogeneous (classifications 1 and 2) or homogeneous (classifications 3 and 4), This presentation describes the methods for distinguishing different types of plaque accurately.
