Blunt carotid artery trauma is an uncommon but potentially dangerous clinical entity. We report eight patients from a 10-year interval who sustained blunt injuries to the carotid arteries. Six of eight patients suffered a hyperextension injury or had a cervical spine fracture or both. Arteriography revealed four arterial dissections and four thrombotic occlusions. Two asymptomatic common carotid artery occlusions and one dissection with transient ischemic attacks had successful arterial reconstructions. Five patients were treated nonoperatively: three internal carotid artery dissections with minor or no neurologic deficit; one asymptomatic thrombosis; and one internal carotid artery thrombosis with a major fixed neurologic deficit that did not improve. No patient died, and seven of eight made a complete neurologic recovery or remained asymptomatic. The diagnosis of blunt carotid artery injuries should be suspected in patients with neck hyperextension injuries or with cervical spine fractures as well as in patients with neurologic deficits not explained by intracranial trauma. Duplex scanning may be a useful noninvasive study. Surgery is indicated for selected patients with accessible lesions who have minor or no neurologic deficits. Asymptomatic patients with small intimal flaps or dissections may be successfully treated nonoperatively.
