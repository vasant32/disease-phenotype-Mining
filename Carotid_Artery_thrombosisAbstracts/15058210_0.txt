 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Chinese traditional medicine complex dribbing-pill of Xue Shuan Tong on thrombus formation in vivo and thrombolysis in vitro of rats. METHODS: Thrombus and thrombolysis were evaluated by carotid artery-jugular vein circuit in vivo and constant temperature natural lysis in vitro respectively. RESULTS: Complex dribbing-pill of Xue Shuan Tong could significantly inhibit thrombus formation in vivo. Coagulated blood could be apparently dissolved by complex dribbing-pill of Xue Shuan Tong. CONCLUSION: Complex dribbing-pill of Xue Shuan Tong could significantly inhibit the thrombus and increase thrombolysis.
