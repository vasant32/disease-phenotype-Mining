Carotid arterial puncture during percutaneous retrogasserian procedures is a common but usually harmless complication. Strokes, resulting presumably from carotid artery thrombosis, have been reported previously following percutaneous retrogasserian coagulation. The authors report two cases of carotid-cavernous fistula, one following percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy and the other after percutaneous retrogasserian block. The latter patient had an anomaully by intracavernous injection of isobutyl-2 cyanoacrylate, using intra-arterial balloon flotation catheters. Carotid-cavernous fistula is a potentially serious complication of such procedures, and may be more common than realized since small fistulas may close spontaneously.
