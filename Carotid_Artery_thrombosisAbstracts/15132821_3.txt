 AIM: To investigate the effects of copper-aspirin complex on rat thrombosis and the interaction between platelets and neutrophils. METHODS: The model of electrically stimulated carotid artery thrombosis in Sprague Dawley rats was used; the effects of copper-aspirin complex on rat platelet-neutrophil adhesion and platelet aggregation stimulated by activated neutrophils were observed by rosette assay and Born's method, respectively. RESULTS: Intragastric copper-aspirin complex (5, 7, and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently prolonged the occlusion time; it significantly decreased the rosette number formed between thrombin-activated platelets and neutrophils; the 50 % of inhibitory concentration (IC50) was (54.6+/-4.3) micromol/L. Copper-aspirin complex markedly inhibited rat platelet aggregation induced by either cell free supernatant of activated neutrophils or by activated neutrophil suspension. The values of IC50 were (224.5+/-16.2) micromol/L and (820.5+/-21.4) micromol/L, whereas aspirin had no influence. CONCLUSION: Copper-aspirin complex inhibited platelet-neutrophil interactions through a different property from aspirin and resulted in a more potent antithrombotic activity.
