Reconstructive surgery was performed on 93 patients with stage III cerebrovascular insufficiency, extracranial stenoses and (or) occlusions of the cerebral blood flow. Compared with the spontaneous course in acute stroke, results of surgery point towards recommending an aggressive procedure provided certain criteria are observed (time limit, absence of haemorrhagia), particularly in view of the potential mortality of the condition. Late prognosis, assessed on the basis of 40 patients subjected to neurological follow-up 4 1/2 years after the operation, can be considered favourable.
