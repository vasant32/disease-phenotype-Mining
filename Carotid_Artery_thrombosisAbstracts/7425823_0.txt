A case of bilateral thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid arteries is reported, with binasal quasiquadrant hemianopsia and partial optic atrophy as the only symptoms. Based on a survey of the literature on internal carotid occclusions and their collateral anastomoses, as well as on their ophthalmologic signs, the possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed.
