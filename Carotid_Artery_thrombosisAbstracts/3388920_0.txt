Report on the first experiences with the local intraarterial streptokinase therapy in 5 patients with acute obliteration processes of the vascular system of the internal carotid artery. Two peripheral obliterations (occlusions of the main branch of the media) could be completely recanalised, with complete regression of the neurological symptomatology. In one of the three complete occlusions of the internal carotid artery (region of the siphon) a considerable partial recanalisation could be achieved. A fourth patient could be dismissed with an essential clinical improvement 11 days later despite angiographic persistence of the occlusion. Two patients died. As directive value for the dosage from 50,000 to 100,000 units streptokinase are proposed as short-term infusion in 30 to 60 minutes.
