Ocular ischaemic syndrome (OIS) is a relatively uncommon condition. Simultaneous bilateral involvement is even less common and has been reported in only 22% of all cases of OIS. It has variable clinical presentations, of which visual loss and ocular pain are the most common. It is believed to occur when there is a 90% or greater carotid artery obstruction. This syndrome is often associated with a number of systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Only occasionally has it been described as a complication of rhinocerebral mucormycosis. We report an unusual case of bilateral OIS secondary to bilateral internal carotid artery thrombosis as a complication of invasive rhinocerebral mucormycosis. In addition, a review of clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up and treatment options for OIS is provided.
