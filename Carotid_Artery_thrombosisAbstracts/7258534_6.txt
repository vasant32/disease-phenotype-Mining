Major postoperative stroke after carotid endarterectomy is often due to carotid thrombosis, and prompt thrombectomy can reverse the neurologic deficit. We advise reoperation providing the stroke occurs within several hours of carotid endarterectomy, preferably when the patient is in the recovery room, and reoperation can be done immediately. We do not delay reoperation for angiography. Reoperation has not been beneficial for strokes that occur later in the patient's course or when there has been a severe preoperative neurologic deficit. Patients with a mild postoperative stroke, especially if the stroke represents worsening of a preoperative deficit, will often improve without intervention.
