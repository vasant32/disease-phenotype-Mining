Resveratrol is one of the major polyphenolics in red wine that has been shown to exert the preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases. The effect of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) administered as an ingredient of the diet on the atherothrombotic tendency was assessed in genetically hypercholesterolemic mice after laser-induced damage on endothelium. Mice lacking both apolipoprotein E and low-density lipoprotein receptor (apoE-/-/LDLR-/-) were fed with a high-fat diet with or without t-RES (9.6 and 96 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks. The atherosclerotic tendency was morphometrically analyzed in their aortae. The thrombotic tendency was determined by inducing thrombus by the irradiation of a helium-neon laser on carotid arteries of these mice with injection of Evans blue. Atherosclerotic area and thrombus size were evaluated by image analyzing in a computer system. Even though the plasma concentrations of lipids (total cholesterol and triacylglycerol) did not change in the control and t-RES groups, a significant decrease (approximately 30%) in the formation of atheroma was observed in the aortae of the t-RES group. The size of laser-induced thrombus that mostly consisted of platelet aggregates was significantly reduced (approximately 25%) in the t-RES group compared with that in the control group. Thus, t-RES orally administrated with a high-fat diet in apoE-/-/LDLR-/- mice significantly suppressed atherosclerosis in their aortae and reduced the laser-induced thrombosis in their carotid arteries.
