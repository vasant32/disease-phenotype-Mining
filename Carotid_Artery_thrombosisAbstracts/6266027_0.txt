Value, indication and limits of serial and static brain radioangiogram in carotid disease are studied comparatively with EEG, Doppler study and cerebral arteriography. The isotopic study shows the occlusion and its consequences on middle cerebral artery and cerebral hemisphere. The "Hot-Nose" sign is rarely seen, but then with large focal abnormalities. In 20% of studied cases, isotopic study provides information about the efficiency of suppleance circulation or the existence of a blood derivation. The value of serial and static scintigraphy deserves it a better place among the non invasive diagnosis method of carotid disease.
