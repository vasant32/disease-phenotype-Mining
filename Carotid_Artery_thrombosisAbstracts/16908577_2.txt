A patient with hypopharyngeal cancer developed carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) treated by self-expandable stent-graft in the left carotid artery. CT scan for progressive right hemiparesis 4 months later showed multiple left cerebral abscesses and left carotid thrombosis. Although deployment of stent-grafts for CBS can achieve initial hemostasis in patients with head-and-neck cancer, the placement of a stent-graft in a field of necrosis and infection is associated with poor long-term outcome. We recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics if endovascular foreign materials are placed in a contaminated field.
