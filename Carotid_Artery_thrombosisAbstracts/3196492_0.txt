The authors measured preoperative rCBF and intraoperative cortical artery pressure (CAP) during STA-MCA anastomosis to investigate cerebral hemodynamics in moyamoya disease. Six of 13 patients including 3 children showed ischemic attack and the remaining presented hemorrhagic attack. rCBF was measured by single photon ECT with Xe-133 inhalation technique. CAP's and rCBF's in moyamoya disease were compared to those in the 22 internal carotid artery (ICA) and 8 middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Systemic arterial blood pressure (SABP) was obtained at the radial artery. Mean rCBF in the MCA territory in moyamoya disease, ICA occlusion, and MCA occlusion were 39, 37, and 33 ml/100 g/min respectively. Mean SABP and CAP in moyamoya disease were 103 and 28 mmHg, respectively. In ICA occlusion, mean SABP and CAP were 98 and 45 mmHg, respectively. In MCA occlusion, mean SABP and CAP were 89 and 36 mmHg, respectively. To clarify the hemodynamics, vascular resistance was obtained from the following equations: The proximal vascular resistance (Rp), which was produced from the cervical ICA to cortical artery, was obtained by (mean SABP - mean CAP)/(rCBF). And distal vascular resistance (Rd) which was produced from the cortical artery to jugular vein, was obtained by (mean CAP)/(rCBF). Mean Rp in moyamoya disease ICA occlusion and MCA occlusion were 2.01, 1.21 and 1.70, respectively. Rd in moyamoya disease, ICA occlusion and MCA occlusion were 0.79, 1.37 and 1.22, respectively. There were significant differences in Rp and Rd between moyamoya disease and ICA or MCA occlusion. In ischemic group in moyamoya disease, rCBF, SABP, CAP, Rp and Rd were 41 ml/100 g/min, 111 mmHg, 28 mmHg, 1.92 and 0.70, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
