The most methods for induction of an experimental arterial thrombosis needs an operative procedure. A method for non-operative induction of thrombosis in peripheric big arteries is presented in this contribution. The technique is endovasal and transcatheteral. The contact of the endovasal electrode with the arterial intima has to be guaranteed for a certain thrombosis. A particularly constructed electrode for application of direct current in big arteries is presented to the realization of this demand.
