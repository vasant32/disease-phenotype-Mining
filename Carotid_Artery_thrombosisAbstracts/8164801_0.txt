A rare case of traumatic occlusion of the carotid artery at the neck caused by a dog bite is reported. A 10-year-old boy presented delayed onset of left hemiparesis after a dog-bite wound in the right neck. CT scan revealed a cerebral infarction in the right basal ganglia, and IV-DSA disclosed complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery at the neck. The patient was treated conservatively and his left hemiparesis improved, but impaired visual acuity remained on the right side. Repeated IV-DSA 12 days later showed recanalization of the right internal carotid artery. The mechanisms of the traumatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery were discussed with reference to the literature.
