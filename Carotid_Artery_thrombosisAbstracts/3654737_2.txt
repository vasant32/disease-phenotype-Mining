Thirteen patients with carotid stenosis were studied by the authors by the measuring the Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) before and after thromboendarterectomy. This test of retinal function measures the recovery time of the amplitude of the major positive peak (P100) after photostress. When compared to that we observed in controls, we found, a significant increase of the P100 recovery time in patients suffering from carotid disease with severe stenosis. The method proved suitable for the functional evaluation of the vascular reconstruction of the carotid area, since four weeks after surgery a physiological recovery of the amplitude of VEP was observed. This method is proposed by the authors for the long-term functional evaluation of patients subjected to carotid thromboendarterectomy for tight stenosis of the carotid bifurcation.
