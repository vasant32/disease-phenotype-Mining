Clinic-experimental complex investigation and ELISA determination of protein HLDF as also primary antibodies (Abs) to HLDF values in blood and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with hypertensive crises and acute aterotrombotic ischemic stroke were performed. Statistically improved difference in serum HLDF and Abs content in examined patients in comparison with age-matched controls as also significant intergroup's differences in protein and Abs dynamic content were determined. Correlation between content and dynamics of investigated factors in CSF and blood serum with determined clinical and instrumental parameters was revealed. Pathogenetic and prognostic significance of revealed changes in molecular factors was viewed.
