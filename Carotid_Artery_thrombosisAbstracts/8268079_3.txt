Blunt trauma involving the innominate and carotid arteries is a rare occurrence that can be lethal or have serious neurologic sequelae. To our knowledge this is the first reported case in the international literature describing the association of posttraumatic innominate artery aneurysm with total occlusion and thrombosis of the common carotid artery at its origin by an intimal flap. The diagnostic problems created by this unusual injury are discussed. In this case the patency of the distal portion of the common and internal carotid arteries was demonstrated by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), whereas color duplex and digital arteriographic studies were unsuccessful. This demonstration was crucial to patient management. Since no studies are available comparing color duplex imaging, conventional arteriography, and MRA in the evaluation of blunt carotid trauma, this case study is presented to demonstrate the utility of MRA in emergency situations. In addition, we analyze the possible pathogenesis and discuss the surgical treatment.
