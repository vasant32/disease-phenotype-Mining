176 sonograms of carotid arteries are compared with the corresponding angiograms to evaluate the diagnostic possibilities of B-mode sonography in detecting arteriosclerotic vessel disease. Ultrasound tomography is proved to be a reliable method to rule out arteriosclerosis; the specificity of the investigation method is 100%. However, the diagnostic value varies concerning the visualization of different arteriosclerotic lesions. B-mode sonography is of minor significance in detecting arteriosclerotic ulcers. Fresh thrombi are often not diagnosed. The sensitivity of this investigation method therefore corresponds 85%.
