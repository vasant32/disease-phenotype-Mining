20 per cent of all patients we operated due to stenoses of the internal carotid artery were found to have kinking of the artery. Several methods of surgical treatment, among these resection of the kinking end-to-end anastomosis, and myoplasty using the digastric muscle are described. Angiography pre- and postoperatively is performed. Cerebral blood flow is measured by the 133 Xenon clearance.
