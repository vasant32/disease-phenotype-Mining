YM872, an AMPA receptor antagonist, was administered together with t-PA to investigate the effects of coadministration on neuroprotection in a rat embolic stroke model, when administered 2 h after embolism. T-PA or YM872 alone decreased infarct volume and improved the neurological deficit score. Coadministration of YM872 and t-PA resulted in a further decrease in infarct volume and improvement of the neurological score as compared with single administration of t-PA. These data demonstrate that coadministration of YM872 and t-PA produces more potent neuroprotective effects than when t-PA is administered alone.
