Using the 16-detector 133Xe-NaCl technique (Novo Cerebrograph) quantitative measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were performed in 13 patients with unilateral carotid obstruction before and after stimulation with 1 g acetazolamide. In all patients resting studies showed no significant difference in hemispheric perfusion and a 47% flow increase after acetazolamide on the side with normal carotid artery. On the obstructed side in 8 patients the hemispheric flow increased equally indicating a sufficient and adequate intracerebral collateral circulation and capacity. In 5 patients a significant redistribution of brain flow occurred with diminished increase on the occluded side. This flow pattern indicates an inadequate vasodilator response and insufficient collateral capacity. The rCBF stimulation test identifies patients with a restricted collateral capacity and these patients could benefit from a surgical treatment.
