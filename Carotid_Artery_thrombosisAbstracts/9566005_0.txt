A 21-year-old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1) had many widespread cutaneous neurofibroma on his right face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed basal meningocele due to dysplasia of the skull base. Carotid and vertebral angiograms revealed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, persistent primitive trigeminal artery. We have reviewed the clinical and radiographic features of this case of neurofibromatosis, meningocele and cerebral arterial abnormalities. NF associated with both intracranial vascular malformation and meningocele is very rare, and in our case both were thought to arise congenitally as a manifestation of mesodermal dysplasia. Careful follow up using MRI and MR angiography should be performed for such patients.
