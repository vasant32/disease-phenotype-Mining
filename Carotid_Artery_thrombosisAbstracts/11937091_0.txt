The pharmacological properties of YM-57029 [4-[4-(4-carbamimidoylphenyl)-3-oxopiperazin-1-yl]piperidino]acetic acid monohydrochloride trihydrate), a novel glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist were examined in this study. YM-57029 inhibited fibrinogen binding to purified glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, 1000-fold more potently than the tetrapeptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (RGDS). YM-57029 concentration-dependently inhibited ADP-, collagen- and high shear stress-induced platelet aggregation, strongly inhibited ATP release from platelets activated by ADP, and enhanced deaggregation of ADP-induced platelet aggregates. In a pro-aggregatory activity study, RGDS or SC-54701A ((S)-3-[3-[(4-amidinophenyl)carbamoyl]propionamido]-4-pentynoic acid monohydrochloride) caused prominent small aggregate formation. At a higher concentration, RGDS induced medium and large size aggregates, and SC-54701A induced medium aggregates. In contrast, YM-57029 produced only a few small and no larger size aggregates. Ex vivo ADP-induced platelet aggregation and platelet retention to collagen-coated plastic beads were dose-dependently inhibited by YM-57029 after intravenous bolus injection in guinea pigs. YM-57029 produced dose-dependent antithrombotic effects in carotid artery thrombosis and arterio-venous shunt thrombosis models in guinea pigs at 10 and 30 microg/kg, respectively. At these doses, YM-57029 prolonged template bleeding time. These results suggest that YM-57029 is a potent glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist which has less pro-aggregatory effect. It may be a promising antiplatelet agent for thromboembolic diseases, and a good prototype for developing an orally active compound.
