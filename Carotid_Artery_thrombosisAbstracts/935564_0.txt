The effects of carotid occlusion on parasympathetic activity were studied in anesthetized dogs, submitted to beta adrenergic blockade. Modifications of the heart rate, before and after administration of atropine, were utilized for assessment of vagal changes. When vagal activity was intact there was elevation of the heart rate. After parasympathetic blockade carotid occlusion did not cause heart rate modifications. The data suggest that carotid occlusion produced vagal inhibition.
