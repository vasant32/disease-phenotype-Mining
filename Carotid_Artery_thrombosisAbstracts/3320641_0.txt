Diagnostic ultrasound of the neck is used mainly for soft tissue examination. Doppler and B-mode sonography are highly valuable methods for the recognition and differentiation of cervical vascular diseases. The advantage of diagnostic ultrasound of cervical vessels in early detection of scarred carotid stenoses after operation and radiotherapy, for the differentiation of neuro-otological diseases, for the detection of primary vascular neck tumours and surgery of neck tumours is demonstrated in selected patients. Diagnostic Doppler and B-mode ultrasound of the cervical vessels facilitates and improves differential diagnosis and therapeutic management for ENT specialists.
