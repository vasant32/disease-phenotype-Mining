 OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore whether free radical damage against DNA exists or not, in human stroke patients. METHOD: Urinary 8-hyroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and serum S100beta were measured in acute cardioembolic stroke patients with relatively severe symptoms. During days 3--5 after the onset of stroke, urine was collected for 24 hours for 8-OHdG measurement and serum was sampled for S100beta analysis every day. RESULTS: The total urinary 8-OHdG content was significantly higher in stroke patients than in non-stroke inpatients (p<0.01). The average value was more than twice the value of that of non-stroke inpatients. The total urinary 8-OHdG contents showed significant correlation (r=0.87, p<0.01) with serum S100beta values, which are reportedly related to brain damage. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that urinary 8-OHdG in acute stroke patients may originate from brain tissue, and DNA damage also exists in the brain of stroke patients.
