The authors report their experience relative to 102 patients evaluated with carotid duplex-scanner. Ultrasonographic data of atherosclerotic carotid changes have been correlated with the outcome of the tested series. In fact, echographic images of vascular changes with high thromboembolic risk (ulcerated plaque) have been associated with cerebrovascular injuries in 25% of the cases. Furthermore, the duplex-scanner showed the need for surgical treatment (TEA) in 32 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Therefore, this noninvasive diagnostic tool seems to play an essential role in the prevention of cerebrovascular ischemia.
