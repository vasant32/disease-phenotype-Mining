Computerized tomography revealed a thrombosed giant intracavernous carotid aneurysm in a man who presented with ophthalmoplegia and headache. Angiography confirmed complete aneurysmal thrombosis and also revealed complete occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. Aneurysmotomy and thrombectomy produced substantial reduction in mass effect, with symptomatic improvement. The spontaneous thrombosis of giant intracranial aneurysms is discussed.
