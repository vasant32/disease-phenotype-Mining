This is a report of a case of internal carotid artery occlusion associated with rhinocerebral phycomycosis. In 18 autopsied similar cases that have been reported previously, hyphae were described in the walls of the internal carotid artery. Four survivors have been reported even though arteriograms demonstrated internal carotid artery occlusion, and a high index of suspicion for this complication should be maintained in all patients with rhinocerebral phycomycosis.
