BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural history of carotid lesions has generally been evaluated in anedoctal series or in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical and pathological modifications linked to an increasing waiting list in our region and the related medico-legal implications. METHODS: Neurological symptoms that occurred during the waiting period were evaluated in 282 out of 491 patients placed on the waiting list for a carotid stenosis less than 80% or without an unstable plaque. The other 202 patients cancelled their booking. Progression of carotid disease was evaluated by duplex scanning in 116 patients who had a duplex evaluation in our Department both at booking and at the time of operation. RESULTS: The incidence of stroke in a mean waiting period of 8.9 months was 2.6% in symptomatic patients and 1.5% in asymptomatic, respectively; 39 (13.8%) patients experienced an ipsilateral TIA and 4.2% a carotid thrombosis (25% of which symptomatic). The crude mortality-rate was 2.4% with a 1% of related deaths. The cumulative actuarial hard end points rate (stroke, carotid thrombosis and related death) was 7.8% at 12 months and 19.8% at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives us data about the natural history of carotid stenosis in our country. The high morbidity and mortality-rate related to this lesion and particularly their occurrence within the first 3 months stress the urgency of treatment, and of the planning of specialized Departments in relation to the real incidence of the pathology in order to avoid medico-legal consequences.
