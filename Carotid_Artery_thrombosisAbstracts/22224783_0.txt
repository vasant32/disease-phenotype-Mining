A flow-diverting stent is placed in the parent artery to reduce blood flow in the aneurysm sac to facilitate progressive thrombosis and neointimal remodeling while maintaining outflow in the side branches and perforators. All international multicenter registries have reported on the progressive occlusion of aneurysms with time and have implied that an occluded aneurysm would not recanalize given the protective effect of the altered hemodynamics. Recanalization of an occluded aneurysm after placement of a flow-diverting stent has not been reported in the literature. The authors here describe a case of aneurysm recanalization after immediate thrombotic occlusion of the aneurysm with a flow-diverting stent. A 46-year-old male chronic smoker with chronic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia had a recurrent internal carotid artery aneurysm 1 year after embolization. Immediate thrombotic occlusion of the aneurysm and cessation of blood flow to the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) occurred immediately after activating a flow-diverting stent, with corresponding ischemic complications. However, 3 months after insertion of the stent, follow-up MR angiography showed recanalization of the aneurysm as well as of the PCoA. Additional angiography studies at 6 months showed near-total occlusion of the aneurysm with the restoration of blood flow to the PCoA.
