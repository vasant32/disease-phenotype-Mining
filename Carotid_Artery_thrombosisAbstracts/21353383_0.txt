A 77-year old man experiencing frequent transient ischemic attacks for five days was admitted to our hospital. Radiological examinations including brain computed tomography, supraaortic computed tomography angiography were performed. Supraaortic computed tomography angiography revealed two thrombi in common carotid artery. Thrombi were located proximally, one of which was elongated and adhared to the arterial wall and the other one was located below bifurcation of left carotid artery. Since the case has been categorized as a high risk patient for ischemic stroke despite the normal neurological status, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was given. Ischemic attacks completely ceased soon after thrombolysis. Control computed tomography angiography revealed normal findings with patent carotid artery, without any clot. To our knowledge this is the only case of transient ischemic attack treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the literature with the score of 0 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.
