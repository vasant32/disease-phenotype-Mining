In 67 patients suspected to suffer from cerebral vascular disorders or arterial occlusive disease results of ophthalmodynamometry and ophthalmodynamography were compared with those of carotid angiography. Especially in patients with angiographically substantiated carotid stenosis the results of ODM and ODG were extraordinarily poor. The findings of ODM and ODG proved to be non indicative in 29 out of 35 cases. The authors discuss the possible reasons of these disappointing results.
