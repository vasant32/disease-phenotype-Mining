Acute embolic occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid bifurcation is associated with a poor prognosis. Recanalization rates of this lesion with intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis are exceedingly low. We describe the use of balloon angioplasty after failed thrombolysis to achieve immediate recanalization of acute carotid T occlusions in two patients. At 1-month follow-up, both patients were alive with neurologic deficits. For acute carotid T occlusion, balloon angioplasty should be considered a first-line endovascular therapy.
