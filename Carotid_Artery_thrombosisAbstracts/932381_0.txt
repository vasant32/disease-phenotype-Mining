The sequence of events and the associated electroencephalographic, echoencephalographic and cerebrospinal fluid findings strongly suggested the presence of an extracerebral hematoma. The cerebral angiographic study, however, disclosed complete occlusion of the extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery in both patients. This report stresses the diagnostic difficulties sometimes encountered in relation to stroke patients.
