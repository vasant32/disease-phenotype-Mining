BACKGROUND: Carotid dissection may lead to many different types of neurological deficits, both transient and permanent. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a patient with an isolated central retinal artery occlusion who was found to have an ipsilateral carotid dissection by neck computed tomographic scan, later confirmed by angiography. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of carotid dissection causing central retinal artery occlusion without any other neurological deficits. It demonstrates the diagnostic usefulness of computed tomographic imaging in such cases.
