One hundred consecutive patients underwent carotid endarterectomy in a small community hospital in North Dakota during a period between 1969 through 1976. All operative procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the Javid shunt. A 1 per cent operative mortality and permanent morbidity resulted. These findings are comparable with those reported from large medical centers having extensive experience in carotid endarterectomy. It is concluded that patients with carotid artery disease can be safely and effectively treated in small medical centers by well trained experienced vascular surgeons.
