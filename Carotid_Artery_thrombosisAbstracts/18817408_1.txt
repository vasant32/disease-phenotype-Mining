Crocetin, a unique carotenoid with potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities, is a major ingredient of saffron used as an important spice and food colorant in various parts of the world. In the present study, the effects of crocetin on platelet activity and thrombosis formation were systematically investigated. Crocetin showed a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, but not by arachidonic acid (AA). Crocetin significantly attenuated dense granule release, while neither platelets adhesion to collagen nor cyclic AMP level was altered by crocetin. Pretreatment with crocetin was confirmed to partially inhibit Ca (2+) mobilization via reducing both intracellular Ca (2+) release and extracellular Ca (2+) influx. Besides that, crocetin prolonged the occlusive time in electrical stimulation-induced carotid arterial thrombosis. These findings suggest that the favorable impacts of crocetin on platelet activity and thrombosis formation may be related to the inhibition of Ca (2+) elevation in stimulated platelets.
