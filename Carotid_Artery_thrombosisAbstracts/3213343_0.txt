Dynamic recording of the brain oxygen level by means of polarography during test with clamping of the superficial temporal artery in the early postoperative period in patients with an extra-intracranial microvascular anastomosis (EICMA) makes it possible to judge whether the anastomosis in patient or occluded. Patent anastomoses were marked by two types of changes occurring on the polarograms in clamping of the donor artery of the anastomosis. They reflect the relations between the EICMA and the natural channels of the collateral blood supply of the brain, correlate to a great measure with the localization of the occluding lesions in the cerebral vessels, and allow the efficacy of the operative intervention to be predicted.
