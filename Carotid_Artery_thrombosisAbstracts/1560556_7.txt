Patch angioplasty of the internal carotid artery after endarterectomy has been advocated as a means of decreasing early postoperative carotid artery thrombosis, as well as reducing the incidence of recurrent carotid artery stenosis. Noninfectious rupture of saphenous vein patches in the early postoperative period has been reported by several authors, leading others to advocate the use of prosthetic patches. This report describes three patients in whom delayed bleeding through needle holes along the suture lines in polytetrafluoroethylene cardiovascular patches occurred between 1.5 and 4 days after operation. All patients required reexploration to control bleeding, and acute respiratory distress from tracheal compression developed in one patient. Although delayed bleeding through needle holes in polytetrafluoroethylene cardiovascular patches appears to be rare, a word of caution may be in order before advocating routine patching of the carotid artery with this particular type of patch.
