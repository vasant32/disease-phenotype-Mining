 OBJECTIVE: To establish and evaluate a rabbit model of arterial thrombosis by modified thread-drawing. METHODS: Fifty-three rabbits were randomly divided into 6 groups: a normal group, a ligating group,a collagen encapsulated thread-drawing group,a aspirin group,a clopidogrel group, and an aspirin clopidogral group. The endovascular pathological changes in the rabbits were observed, and D-fructose-1,6-diphosphate trisodium salt octahydrate (FDP), D-Dimer and tissue factor (TF) were detected with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In the thread-drawing group, thrombus was obvious, and the endovascular elastic membrane was injured seriously compared with the ligating group. After being treated with aspirin and clopidogrel, most arterial thrombus was softened, dissolved and absorbed. Compared with that in the modified thread-drawing group,wet and dry weight of thrombus increased,and the level of D-Dimer, FDP and TF also increased in the modified thread-drawing group (P<0.01). After being treated by aspirin and/or clopidogrel, the wet and dry weight of thrombus and the level of D-Dimer, FDP and TF decreased compared with the control (P<0.01). Aspirin plus clopidogral could obviously reduce the wet and dry weight of thrombus, and reduce the level of D-Dimer and FDP (P<0.01). Aspirin plus clopidogral could obviously inhibit the formation of TF compared with aspirin (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Arterial thrombosis model by collagen encapsulated thread-drawing which is visible, repeatable and effective is better than thread-drawing. It is suitable for screening anti-thrombosis drugs and evaluating their effect.
