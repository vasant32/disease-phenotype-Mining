In the past three years, we have used a superfine fiberscope for endovasculoscopy, ventriculoscopy, and myeloscopy. Flexible superfine fiberscope, 0.75 mm in outer diameter, could visualize various intravascular findings. In in-vivo canine experiment, sequential changes of thrombus produced by endothelial abrasion by needle or balloon in the canine carotid artery can be clearly seen. And thrombolysis by focal arterial injection of tissue plasminogen activator was sequentially observed. In the clinical study, we could evaluate the stenotic lesions of the subclavian and vertebral arteries before and after balloon angioplasty. During ventriculoscopy, a 2 mm of mini-caliber fiberscope was introduced under ultrasound monitoring, and provided clear visualization of intraventricular tumours. In myeloscopy, draining veins of arteriovenous malformations and nerve roots of the cauda equina could be clearly seen by flexible fiberscope. From these results, it can be said that the superfine fiberscope provides clear and useful visualizations of the interior of vessels, ventricles, and the intrathecal area of the spinal canal. The new applications of this superfine fiberscope for minimally invasive neurosurgery may bring about a marked improvement of therapeutic results.
