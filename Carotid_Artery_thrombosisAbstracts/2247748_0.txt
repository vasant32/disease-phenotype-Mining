From March 1980 to July 1988 a consecutive series of 256 patients (p.) underwent 301 carotid endarterectomy + patch with routine use of continuous intraoperative EEG monitoring and selective use of an intraluminal shunt (IS) for the presence of an atherosclerotic plaque concerning the internal carotid artery (ICA). Patients were divided in two groups: the first (42 p.) marked by contralateral ICA occlusion, the second (214 p.) without contralateral ICA occlusion (259 CEA). Immediate peroperative, long term and global (immediate and long term) outcomes were prospectively and comparatively studied. A temporary IS was inserted in 27 p. (64%) of the group I and in 38 p. (14%) of the group II. Immediate permanent postoperative neurological deficit occurred in 1 p. of group I (2.38%) and in 2 p. (0.9%) in group II. Immediate postoperative mortality was 0% and 0.9% in group I and II respectively. All p. had neurological valuation and Echo-Doppler of operated ICA and of the contralateral ICA every 6 months (middle follow-up 44 months). New neurological symptoms compared in 5.8% of p. of group I and in 5.23% of p. of group II with a stroke rate of 0% and 2.32% respectively. There were 2 restenosis of operated ICA, both of them in p. of group I, that underwent reoperation. In the two groups the principal causes of deaths were myocardial infarct and cancer; in the group I no death was due to stroke versus 1.86% in the group II.
