 BACKGROUND: Factor Xa (FXa) has been a target of considerable interest for drug development efforts aimed at suppressing thrombosis. In this report, a new orally active, small molecule, active-site directed FXa inhibitor, GW813893, has been profiled in a succession of in vitro and in vivo assays involved in its preclinical characterization as a potential antithrombotic therapeutic. METHODS: In vitro profiling of GW813893 consisted of assessing its inhibitory potential against FXa and a broad panel of related and unrelated enzymes and receptors. Additionally, the FXa inhibition potential of GW813893 was assessed in prothrombinase and plasma-based clotting assays. In vivo characterization of GW813893 consisted of thrombosis studies in a rat inferior vena cava model, a rat carotid artery thrombosis model, and a rabbit jugular thrombosis model. Bleeding studies were conducted in a rat tail transection model. Ex vivo determinations of compound effects on FX and clotting activity were also undertaken. RESULTS: GW813893 was more than 90-fold selective over all enzymes tested, and it inhibited FXa and prothrombinase activity with a Ki of 4.0 nM and 9.7 nM, respectively. In vivo, GW813893 concentration-dependently suppressed thrombotic activity in all models tested. The antithrombotic activity correlated with the suppression of plasma-based clotting activity and the inhibition of plasma FX activity (P < 0.02). Over the antithrombotic dose-range, an increased bleeding diathesis was not observed. CONCLUSION: These experiments demonstrate that GW813893 is a potent, selective, orally active inhibitor of FXa. The data suggest that GW813893 has robust antithrombotic potential at doses that have no detectable hemostasis liability. Collectively, the profile suggests that GW813893 has the preclinical pharmacology underpinnings of an oral antithrombotic therapeutic.
