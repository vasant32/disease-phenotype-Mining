The endothelium and underlying internal elastic lamina of the arteries from 16 carotid-jugular arteriovenous fistulae in rabbits were examined using the en face technique and scanning electron microscopy respectively. Tears appeared in the internal elastic lamina of the arteries 3 days post-operatively. The overlying endothelium exhibited cytoplasmic pallor, loss of argyrophilia of cell borders, and at times attenuated endothelial cells bridging thrombus covered regions of denudation. Early endothelial lesions repaired rapidly and were found only 3-7 days post-operatively despite progressive increase in frequency and extent of tears and the development of interconnecting longitudinal tears with time. Following repair endothelial cells over the tears were small with hyperchromatic nuclei and oriented mostly parallel to the arterial axis. Endothelial cell density overlying these elastic tissue tears increase to three times that in contralateral arteriotomized common carotid arteries. These endothelial changes were sharply delineated by the margins of the elastic tears. Cell density over the tears reached its maximum 9-11 days post-operatively with mitotic figures both in the floor of the tears and over islands of residual elastic lamina. With time the cell density progressively diminished and endothelial cells assumed a more conventional elongated spindle shape.
