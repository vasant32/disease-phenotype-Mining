 INTRODUCTION: Various clinical manifestations can occur in syphilis, especially meningovascular syphilis. We report three cases of ischemic stroke related to meningovascular syphilis and HIV infection. CASE REPORTS: Three men, aged 30, 31 and 41, presented typical neurologic deficit leading to the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Radiographic investigations showed internal carotid thrombosis in two patients, and a basilar stenosis in the third. CSF analysis and blood samples revealed meningovascular syphilis associated with HIV infection. The other explorations were normal. CONCLUSION: Due to the reemergence of syphilis, search for Treponema pallidum infection should be systematic in young stroke victims.
