 AIM: We present a novel, previously undescribed technique of obtaining a biopsy from an inaccessible parapharyngeal space mass. METHOD: A modified endo-cavitary ultrasound probe was utilised to obtain an intra-oral, image-guided core biopsy of a parapharyngeal tumour. The parapharyngeal mass was not accessible to percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy due to its anatomical location. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first such modification of the conventional endo-cavitary probe technique described in the literature. The technique permits accurate, well controlled biopsy of lesions located high in the parapharyngeal space, under general anaesthesia.
