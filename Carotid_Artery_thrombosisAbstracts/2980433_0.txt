In order to prove that platelet scintigraphy (PSC) is able to detect carotid thrombi formations, we performed PSC in 15 patients directly before or immediately after a percutaneous carotid angiography. PSC was successful in demonstrating iatrogenic fresh carotid thrombi in 13 out of 15 cases. Out of 53 patients with cerebrovascular disease and carotid stenosis a pathologic platelet accumulation was seen in 39 carotid arteries, 31 on the symptomatic side; more often in slight- and middle-sized stenoses than in high degree stenoses. We assume that in these cases PSC detected carotid thrombi which caused arterio-arterial emboli.
