In 6 patients with a trauma in wintersport we observed carotid artery injuries in the past 13 years. The diagnosis were two occlusions, one dissection, a bilateral stenosis, a traumatic aneurysm and a subclavian steal phenomenon. A spontaneous bilateral thrombosis of the carotid artery was seen during skiing. A carotid artery lesion should be diagnosed as soon as possible followed by an adequate therapy.
