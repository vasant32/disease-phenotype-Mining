In order to specifically detect the localization of thrombus in vivo, we have recently developed two monoclonal antibodies (SZ-58, SZ-63) which can specifically bind to cross-linked fibrin. The binding rates of the two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to human plasma clots in vitro were 46.4 +/- 2.3% for 125I-SZ-58, 50.1 +/- 1.7% for 125I-SZ-63 and 3.4 +/- 1.6% for 125I-SZ-53 (control, MoAb against TM). It was shown that both SZ-58 and SZ-63 possess properties of inhibiting the polymerization of fibrin, and SZ-58 could also inhibit the aggregation of platelets induced by ADP. These characteristics make the two MoAbs suitable in the detection of thrombus in vivo. According to the cross reaction tests, thrombi in the jugular veins and carotid arteries in rabbits were made. After injection of the 125I-labeled MoAbs (100,000 cpm/ml of blood), the thrombi and the blood were taken and weighed at various time intervals and radioactivities were measured by an autogamma counter. The ratios of thrombus to blood radioactivity (T/B) of thrombi in jugular veins were 3.0, 5.6 and 3.0 for 125I-SZ-58, 1.5, 3.0 and 5.2 for 125I-SZ-63 and 1.2, 1.0 and 0.7 for control (125I-SZ-53) at the 3rd, 12th and 24th hour after the injection of the radiolabled MoAbs, while the radioactivities of arterial thrombi were almost the same as that in blood after the injection of the two radiotracers. Therefore, it can be concluded that both SZ-58 and SZ-63 can be used in venous thrombus imaging in vivo and the optimal times of imaging are at the 12th hour for SZ-58, 24th hour for SZ-63 after the injection of the radiolabled MoAbs.
