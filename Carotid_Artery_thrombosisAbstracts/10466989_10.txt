Atherosclerotic carotid plaque morphology and especially, intraplaque hemorrhage are assumed to be related to neurological symptoms. Most researchers have only investigated the incidence of intraplaque hemorrhage in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. In the present study, the amount of intraplaque hemorrhage is determined in carotid endarterectomy specimens from 33 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients that caused >70% luminal stenosis. The plaque components (fibrosis, lipids, intraplaque hemorrhage, calcification, and intraluminal thrombosis) were quantified as a percentage of the total plaque volume. A high incidence of intraplaque hemorrhage was found in both the symptomatic (94%, 31/33) and asymptomatic (71%, 10/14) patients. The amount of intraplaque hemorrhage was very small within the plaques of the symptomatic (0.39% +/- 0.70%) and asymptomatic (0.37% +/- 1.12%) patients. The plaques of the symptomatic patients contained more fibrosis than lipids (45.62% +/- 14.99% and 20.45% +/- 21.45%, respectively), as did the plaques of the asymptomatic patients (42. 51% +/- 15.28% and 15.46% +/- 15.22%, respectively). Finally, intraluminal thrombosis and calcification were rare. We conclude that the amount of intraplaque hemorrhage was very small and therefore question its direct role in the development of neurological symptoms. In general, the "unstable" plaque contained more fibrosis than lipids.
