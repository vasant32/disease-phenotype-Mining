Claude Miller Fisher is quoted as the discoverer of the pathogenic relationship between the carotid artery occlusive disease and cerebral ischemia, through his work published in 1951, where he describes the cerebral consequences arising from the internal carotid artery occlusion and, later on, the diverse clinical manifestations that it can cause (TIA's and CVA's). However, 20 years before, Egas Moniz, following the research work which lead to the discovery of cerebral angiography, had already mentioned and demonstrated such relationship, and published their observations in the portuguese, spanish and french medical literatures. As he did not published his works in the english literature, he did not get credit nor recognition on the fact, that was later developed by Miller Fisher who dedicated extensive contribution and divulgation on the subject. The present paper is dedicated to an historical review of the pionier work of Egas Moniz and co-workers, aimed to a better understanding of the pathogenic relationship between internal carotid artery occlusions and cerebral ischemia.
