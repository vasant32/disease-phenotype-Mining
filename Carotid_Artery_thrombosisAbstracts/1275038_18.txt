A 60-year-old woman with ocular hypertension developed unilateral venous stasis retinopathy and neovascularization of the optic disk as the first signs of carotid occlusive disease. The retinopathy and the neovascularization disappeared rapidly and dramatically after carotid endarterectomy. Neovascularization in venous stasis retinopathy must be maintained by hypoxia or hypoperfusion, possibly through some intermediate substance such as a vasoproliferative factor.
