Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a rare but often fatal fungal infection. We present 2 patients with mucormycosis complicated by internal carotid artery thrombosis. Magnetic resonance imaging was superior to computed tomography in localizing the pathological process. Subtotal resection of devitalized tissue and intravenous amphotericin B therapy resulted in a successful outcome for both patients. Prompt recognition of this disorder by using modern diagnostic and therapeutic modalities promises to improve survival rates.
