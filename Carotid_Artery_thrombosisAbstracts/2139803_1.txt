To determine the incidence and extent of distal embolization during percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and rotational thrombectomy (PRT), we collected, filtered, and weighed the distal effluent of acute thrombotically occluded canine arteries following mechanical thrombolysis. PRT (n = 11) and PTA (n = 10) were equally effective in recanalizing occluded vessels (91% vs. 90%) and reduced percent diameter stenosis to a similar degree (97 +/- 6% to 8 +/- 11% and 100 +/- 0% to 17 +/- 23%, respectively). Distal embolization following mechanical intervention was observed in 10 of 10 and 8 of 9 arteries recanalized with PRT and PTA, respectively. The mean weights of collected emboli were similar between the two groups (18 +/- 24 mg vs. 37 +/- 79 mg, PRT vs. PTA, P = NS), although the range of size and weight of thromboemboli was larger in the PTA group (0-206 mg vs. 2-51 mg, PRT). Angiographically defined residual thrombus was significantly less frequent in arteries recanalized with PRT as compared with PTA (10% vs. 55%, P = 0.03). In summary, PRT and PTA are equally effective in recanalizing acutely occluded canine arteries and result in similar reductions in percent diameter stenosis. Each intervention results in distal embolization of thrombi. PRT is associated with a reduced incidence of angiographically evident residual thrombus at the site of arterial injury and may avoid embolization of large fragments occasionally produced by PTA. Thus PRT may serve as a useful alternative to coronary angioplasty during acute myocardial infarction.
