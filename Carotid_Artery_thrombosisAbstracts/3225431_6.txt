Blunt carotid artery trauma represents only 3% of all carotid artery injuries, but 42% of reported cases have been associated with severe neurologic deficits. We present a case of blunt injury to the right internal carotid artery with subsequent thrombosis and neurologic deficit. Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was normal, a finding that emphasizes the importance of obtaining carotid arteriograms in any patient with a focal neurologic deficit but a normal CT of the head. We review the incidence, mechanism, presentation, and treatment of blunt carotid injuries. We also stress the importance of observing for blunt carotid injuries in the patient with blunt cervical trauma in order to allow earlier intervention, since patient outcome is dependent on that early recognition and intervention.
