Heparin is the most frequently used drug for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis. Its use, however, is restricted by its side-effects. To study the efficacy of other glycosaminoglycans that could substitute heparin in the management of arterial thrombosis, 60 guinea-pigs were randomly allocated into 6 groups: G1 = control, G2 = heparin (150 IU/kg), G3 = heparan sulfate from beef pancreas (2.5 mg/kg), G4 = heparan sulfate from beef lung (2.5 mg/kg), G5 = N-acetylated heparan from beef pancreas, G6 = dermatan sulfate from beef intestine (2.5 mg/kg). Ten minutes after intravenous injection of the drugs, thrombosis was induced by the injection of a 50% glucose solution into a segment of the right carotid artery isolated between 2 thread loops during 10 minutes. Three hours later the artery was re-exposed and if a thrombus was present it was measured, withdrawn and weighed. Thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were measured in all animals. Thrombus developed in 90% of the animals in the control group, 0% in G2 and G3, 62.5% in G4, 87.5% in G5 and G6. Only in the animals treated with heparin the coagulation tests were prolonged. In conclusion, in the used dose only the heparan sulfate from beef pancreas presented an antithrombotic effect similar to heparin in this experimental model.
