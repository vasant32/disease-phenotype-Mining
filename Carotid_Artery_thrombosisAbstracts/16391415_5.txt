Although there are some in vitro evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II) may promote thrombosis, there is still no data concerning effect of Ang II on arterial thrombus formation. In the present study we have investigated the influence of Ang II on electrically induced arterial thrombosis in a common carotid artery of renovascular hypertensive rats. Furthermore, we examined if Ang II effect is mediated via AT1 receptor. We measured some coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters at the same time. Since platelets play crucial role in the initiation of arterial thrombosis their contribution in the mode of Ang II action was also determined. Intravenous infusion of Ang II caused significant increase in arterial thrombus weight, which was reversed by losartan, selective AT1 receptor antagonist. The prothrombotic effect of Ang II was accompanied by increase in haemostatic and decrease in fibrinolytic potential of rat plasma. While number of data has clearly demonstrated that Ang II can augment human platelets aggregation, at least in rats, platelets were not involved in the mechanism of Ang II action. Our study shows that Ang II via AT1 receptor accelerates arterial thrombosis in renovascular hypertensive rat, therefore may be considered as a risk factor of myocardial infarction or stroke.
