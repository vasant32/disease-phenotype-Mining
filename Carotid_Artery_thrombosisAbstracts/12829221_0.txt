INTRODUCTION: We report 2 cases of bilateral carotid thrombosis secondary to repeated attempts of strangulation. EXEGESIS: The first case was discovered in a 31-years-old woman who complained of psychiatric manifestations, memory loss and aphasia. Subsequently she developed hemiplegia which worsened under low dose aspirin. The second case occurred in a 41-years-old woman who presented with sudden hemiplegia and aphasia. Diagnosis of bilateral carotid thrombosis based on angiocomputerized tomography or angioRMI data which suggested dissection. Thrombosis location was similar: bilateral, symmetric, close to the carotid bifurcation. Both women had atherosclerosis risk factors: current smoking, use of estrogen containing pill, dyslipidemia and/or familial cardiovascular history. Search for thrombophilia was negative. Both women had been victims of intimate partner violence with repeated attempts of strangulation, but they were stopped 8 and 6 years before the diagnosis of carotid thrombosis. Several private interviews were necessary before knowing the exact cause. CONCLUSION: Symmetrical bilateral thrombosis of internal carotids near the bifurcation should lead to evoke repeated attempts of strangulation, even if there are arterial risk factors, and especially if the patient is a middle-aged female. The therapy is not codified but prolonged anticoagulation is generally prescribed.
