The authors describe two cases with a carotid thrombosis at the level of the skull base. The clinical course and the pathogenesis are discussed with reference to 15 similar cases in the literature. It is considered that a direct injury to the vessel wall is the cause of the carotid thrombosis. To assist in the diagnosis angiography should be undertaken as early as possible. A good collateral supply is the prerequisite for a favourable result.
