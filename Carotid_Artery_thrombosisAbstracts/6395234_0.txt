The comparison of the results of continuous emission Doppler examinations and arteriographic examinations concerned 316 internal carotid arteries in 209 patients presenting a history of one or more ischemic accidents involving the carotid. This work confirms the unreliability of Doppler examination in the diagnosis of atheromatous plaques or moderate stenotic lesions of the internal carotid. However, it confirms the validity of this technique in the diagnosis of obstructive carotid stenoses since all the parameters measuring reliability (sensibility, specificity, predictive value) are around 90%. This reliability associated with the non-traumatic nature of the test justifies its important role in the diagnosis and prevention of cerebrovascular accidents.
