The platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor (GPIIb/IIIa, fibrinogen receptor) represents the final common pathway for platelet aggregation. Inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa with antibodies or peptides containing the RGD sequence has been reported to prevent arterial thrombosis. We examined DMP 728 [(cyclic[D-2-amino-butyryl-N2-methyl-L-arginyl-glycyl-L-aspartyl-3-(a min o- methyl-benzoic acid], methanesulfonic acid salt], a cyclic peptidomimetic, GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, for prevention of thrombosis and rethrombosis in a canine model of carotid artery thrombosis. Dogs were anesthetized, and both carotid arteries were instrumented with an electrode, a flow probe, and a stenosis. A 300-microA current was applied to the intimal surface in the right carotid artery (RCA, control) through the electrode; time to occlusive thrombus formation and thrombus mass was noted. The RCA served as the control vessel; the left carotid artery (LCA) served as the test vessel after DMP 728 administration (0.1 or 1. mg/kg, intravenously, i.v.). As compared with controls, occlusive thrombus formation was reduced by both doses of DMP 728 (control 100% n = 12; 0.1 mg/kg i.v. 17%, p < 0.05, n = 6; 1.0 mg/kg i.v. 0%, p < 0.05, n = 6), time to occlusion was increased (p < 0.05), and thrombus weight was reduced (p < 0.05). Ex vivo platelet aggregation was inhibited in all groups. In a second group of animals, a carotid artery thrombus was formed and lysed with anisoylated plasminogen activator complex (APSAC; 0.05 U/kg intraarterially, i.a.) with or without DMP 728.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
