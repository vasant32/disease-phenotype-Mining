PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of combining stent implantation in the parent artery with endosaccular coil placement for the treatment of experimentally created wide-necked aneurysms. METHODS: Wide-necked aneurysms were surgically created on the common carotid artery in 12 swine. A metal stent was endovascularly implanted across each aneurysm neck and its effect documented anigiographically. If the aneurysm remained patent, a microcatheter was introduced into the aneurysm through the stent mesh. Electrically detachable coils were delivered into the aneurysm sac to produce thrombosis. RESULTS: After stent implantation, one carotid artery thrombosed and two aneurysms spontaneously occluded. In the other 9 cases, coils were deposited through the stent to occlude the aneurysm. Complete aneurysm packing was possible in all 9 cases. The presence of the stent allowed placement of small coils near the aneurysm neck, thus contributing to the safe occlusion of small remnants in the final stages of aneurysm packing. CONCLUSION: The combination of stent implantation and coil placement is feasible in the treatment of experimental wide-necked saccular aneurysms. The stent maintains patency of the parent artery while allowing aneurysm occlusion by endosaccular coil placement through the stent's mesh. Occlusion of small aneurysm remnants is possible with no fear of coil hernation or migration into the parent artery. Long-term studies will be necessary before application to treatment of selected intracranial aneurysms.
