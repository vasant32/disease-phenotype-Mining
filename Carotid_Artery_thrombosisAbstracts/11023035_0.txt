Studies with In-111 platelets were conducted to evaluate pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombus and cardiac thrombus. This study aimed to evaluate active thrombi and possible new emboli in patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the first 24 hours by using autologous In-111 platelets. Twenty-five patients were included in the study. Carotid artery thrombi observed in 10 patients with this technique were confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography. Intracranial thrombi appearing in 3 cases were verified by X-ray computed tomography (CT). Scintigraphy of 8 patients who showed findings suggesting CVA in CT revealed no abnormal accumulation. This was attributed to the possibility that they were small in size, deep in location and/or were also quite aged. Abnormal accumulations observed in the lungs of 3 patients and in the mediastinum and pelvis in one patient were verified by other radiological methods. In-111 platelet study was found to be useful in patients with CVA to evaluate the active thrombi and possible emboli in the early period before clinical symptoms appeared.
