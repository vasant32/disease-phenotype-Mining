The discovery of cisplatin has made arguably the biggest contribution to cancer medicine, providing the basis for the chemotherapy treatment of many malignancies. In addition to well-documented toxicities such as neurotoxicity, cisplatin-induced vascular toxicity is becoming an increasing concern, with some authors describing it in up to 12% of patients. Given the efficacy of cisplatin, vascular toxicity represents a significant survivorship issue. We describe different manifestations of cisplatin-associated thrombosis and its putative pathophysiology.
