Results of treatment of 114 patients for ten-year period, operated on for diseases of extracranial vessels, were adduced. Up to 1998 after performance of reconstructive operation as anticoagulant heparin was used in 80 patients and in last time--low-molecular heparin clexane in 34. After operation all patients survived. An ischemic insult occurred in 2-3 days after the operation in 2(2.5%) patients, while application of heparin, in 5--positive changes of the disease course were absent, in 19(23.75%)--postoperative hemorrhagic complications occurred. When clexane was administered in 2(5.9%) patients the cerebral hemodynamics improvement was not noted, complications in the early and late postoperative periods were absent. In term of observation up to 5 years good results was noted in 21(62.3%) patient, fair--in 9 (27.2%). In late postoperative period the brain hemodynamics improvement was not noted in 2 (5.9%) patients. Application of clexane for the arterial thrombosis prophylaxis is clinically substantiated and permits to reduce significantly the risk of the complications occurrence, which are observed with usage of heparin.
