BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy has demonstrated excellent results over the past 2 decades with combined stroke mortality of < 4% in most active centers. However, the optimal technique for surgical reconstruction for patients with acute postoperative deficits is more controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the last 10 years (1985 to 1995), we performed 1,267 carotid endarterectomies, with 17 strokes (1.3%) and 16 deaths (1.2%). Twenty-four patients developed acute (within 72 hours) postoperative neurologic deficits. In 10 patients, the carotid artery was confirmed patent by duplex scan or angiography, and the neurologic deficit resolved without further therapy. Early reexploration was performed in 14 cases for suspected thrombosis associated with a new neurologic deficit. In each case, resection of the endarterectomy site and an interposition bypass was performed with greater saphenous vein (11), jugular vein (2), or polytetrafluoroethylene (2) grafts. (One patient required a new bypass for acute occlusion of the initial vein bypass.) Postoperatively, 8 patients had complete resolution of their deficit, 3 had minimal residual deficits, and 3 suffered permanent stroke. However, 2 of these patients died. RESULTS: Carotid artery bypass with exclusion of the endarterectomy site resulted in improvement in symptoms in 79% (11 of 14) of the patients and complete resolution in 57% (8 of 14). In long-term follow up (1 to 41 months), there have been no occlusions and one restenosis requiring revision at 11 months. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery bypass can be performed safely with acceptable results. The use of autogenous venous conduits allows reconstruction with an endothelial lined conduit that may improve results in patients with acute postoperative neurologic deficit secondary to thrombosis of the endarterectomized carotid artery.
