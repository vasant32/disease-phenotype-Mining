INTRODUCTION: The frequent etiology of panhypopituitarism is a hypopituitary adenoma. An exceptional cause, with less than 40 cases in the literature, is intra-sellar carotid aneurism. OBSERVATION: A 55 year-old woman was treated for panhypopituitarism related to bilateral aneurism of the carotid arteries. Hormone exploration revealed anterior pituitary deficiency involving all the axes except the corticotrophin and prolactin functions. Pituitary MRI showed an atrophic pituitary, compressed by two calcified aneurismal formations located on the terminals of two internal, partially thrombotic, carotid arteries. Surgical treatment was not envisaged 12 years later. Replacement therapy for life was initiated. COMMENTS: The mechanisms explaining the occurrence of panhypopituitarism secondary to intra-cranial aneurism are hypothetical: compressive phenomena, ischemia and apoplexy of a pituitary adenoma related to the aneurism.
