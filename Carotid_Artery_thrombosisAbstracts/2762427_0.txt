The paper opens with an account of what may be entailed in traumatic damage to cerebral vessels and cervical vessels, and its pathomechanism. There follows an account of two cases involving traumatic cerebral infarction and the resulting problems for the expert witness. Ascertainment of the relationship between external trauma and cerebral infarction depends on the nature and degree of the traumatic violence (precise trauma anamnesis), the reaction of the organism thereto, and the seriousness of previous complaints (arteriosclerosis, causes of cerebral embolism).
