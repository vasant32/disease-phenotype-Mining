An analysis of neurologic syndromes associated with extracranial damage to the internal carotid artery (165 cases), necropsy findings (130 cases), and computer-aided tomography (205 cases) have demonstrated that infarctions more often develop outside the zones of the contiguous blood supply or, involving these zones, constitute a part of a more extensive focus of lesion. This is explained by the presence of combined pathology of extra- and intracranial arteries, with localization and size of the infarction being largely determined by abnormal changes of the artery which directly supplies the brain. A predominant damage to zones of contiguous blood supply is accounted for by a general diminution of the blood supply to the brain due to extracranial damage to the carotid artery without any considerable attendant alteration in the cerebral arteries per se.
