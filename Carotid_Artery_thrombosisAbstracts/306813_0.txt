The case of a 21 years old man with hemiplegia and hyperthermia of sudden onset is reported. The angiographic study showed thrombosis of the distal portion of the internal carotid artery. Laboratorial studies revealed positive rheumatic tests. The authors think that the rheumatic arteritis may be responsible for this ischemic cerebral accident. Differential diagnosis with the embolic accidents caused by the rheumatic disease is discussed.
