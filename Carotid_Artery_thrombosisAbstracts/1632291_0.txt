The antithrombotic efficacy of the prostacyclin analogue naxaprostene has been tested in rabbits with copper coil-induced carotid artery thrombosis. With oral pretreatment, 10 mg/kg naxaprostene prevented thrombotic arterial occlusion; with intraduodenal pretreatment the efficacy of naxaprostene was enhanced and 1 mg/kg was sufficient to exert an antithrombotic effect. The final average carotid blood flow at 180 min compared to the flow immediately before thrombus induction was 85 +/- 25% and 47 +/- 18% in animals treated with 10 mg/kg p.o. resp. 1 mg/kg i.d. naxaprostene. Parallel to the antithrombotic effect, naxaprostene inhibited ADP- and collagen-induced fall in circulating platelets. In anesthetized rabbits there was no dissociation between antithrombotic and hypotensive effects of naxaprostene.
