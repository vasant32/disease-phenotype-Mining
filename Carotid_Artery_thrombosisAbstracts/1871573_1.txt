Nine patients with a cervical tumour, diagnosed by duplex Doppler sonography were additionally evaluated by colour-coded Doppler sonography (CCDS). The duplex Doppler diagnosis of three internal carotid artery aneurysm was confirmed by CCDS in only one patient. In the remaining two cases CCDS identified a marked coiling of the internal carotid artery. Three low echogenic lesions, interpreted as cervical lymphomas by conventional Doppler sonography were identified as two internal carotid aneurysm with partial thrombosis and a carotid body tumour in the third patient by CCDS. Duplex-Doppler sonography and CCDS agreed in the diagnosis of two AV-malformations and one carotid body tumour. Angiography confirmed the CCDS-diagnosis in 7 patients. In the two patients with coiling of the ICA angiographic evaluation was not performed. Thus, CCDS was superior to duplex Doppler sonography in the evaluation of vascular lesions of the extracranial section of the carotid artery and provided additional diagnostic information.
