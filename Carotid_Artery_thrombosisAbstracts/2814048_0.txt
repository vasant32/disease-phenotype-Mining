The Doppler transcranial sonography is useful in making a correct, functional diagnosis of cerebral hemodynamics in the case of internal carotid artery lesions. Being a noninvasive method, it can be employed in following up the evolution of a stenosis, for assessing the collateral blood supply in the territory of the obstructed artery branches and thus for determining the prognosis of a cerebral infarction. For an adequate prophylactic and curative treatment the method is recommended, alone, in estimating the extra and intracranial circulation.
