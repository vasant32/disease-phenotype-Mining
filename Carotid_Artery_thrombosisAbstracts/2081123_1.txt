Carotid echotomography (CET) in the duplex system was made in 118 patients with atherosclerotic lesions of various degree (insignificant stenoses--ISS; significant stenoses--SS and thromboses) of the extracranial carotid axis. The atherosclerotic lesions were localized mainly at the level of the carotid bifurcation (CB) and/or at the level of the carotid sinus. The clinical form of the ischaemic attack was better correlated with the extension of atherosclerotic lesions in the extracranial carotid axis than with the severity of these lesions.
