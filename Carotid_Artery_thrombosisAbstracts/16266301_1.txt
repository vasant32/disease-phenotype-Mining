Fibrin coatings on prosthetic vascular graft, which are conventionally produced by fibrinogen and thrombin, are expected to improve antithrombogenicity and healing characteristics. Thrombin is one of the factors of blood coagulation cascade; however, it has a possibility to play a negative role in the graft antithrombogenicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of our new grafts, thrombin-free fibrin-coated small caliber vascular prostheses. Knitted polyester fabric vascular prostheses 2 mm in internal diameter were coated with fibrin coating with thrombin (Graft I) or without thrombin (Graft II). Both grafts were implanted in bilateral common carotid arteries of 35 Japanese white rabbits, with Graft I in one side and Graft II in the contralateral side. Graft patency, histology, thrombin activity, and platelet deposition were compared between both grafts on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 30, and 60. Both grafts were patent without thrombus or stenosis at each end point (maximal period, POD 60). Macro- and microscopic findings revealed that no obvious difference was observed between both grafts. Before graft implantation, thrombin activities in Grafts I and II were 0.711 +/- 0.086 and 0.009 +/- 0.007 optical density at 405 nm, respectively. Thrombin activity of Graft II was significantly less than that of Graft I in every period after graft implantation, and platelet deposition of Graft II was significantly less than that of Graft I until POD 30. Thrombin-free fibrin-coated vascular prostheses have superior performance of antithrombogenicity to conventional fibrin-coated vascular prostheses with thrombin.
