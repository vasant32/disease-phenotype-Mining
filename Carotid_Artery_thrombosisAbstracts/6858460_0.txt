A report is given on pathomorphic local findings in the cervical vessels and cerebral complications after direct (percutaneous) carotid angiography (d.c.a.). The studies were based on 1345 d.c.a. in 1199 patients of our establishment carried out in the period from July 1966 to the end of 1981. 112 d.c.a. of 102 decreased and dissected patients were pathomorphically evaluated. Of these, 12 cases showed massive angiographically produced findings in the cervical vessels, five of them with verified cerebral complications. In the cervical vessels, both A. carotis communis and V. jugularis may be affected. Circulatory disturbances of the cerebrum manifest themselves in anaemic and/or haemorrhagic disturbances. The relative importance of complications after d.c.a., their frequency as well as possibilities of a reduction are discussed.
