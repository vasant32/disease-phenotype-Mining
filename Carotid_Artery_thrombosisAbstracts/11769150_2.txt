The use of a patch after carotid endarterectomy (CE) is recommended to reduce the incidence of restenosis. Most studies on this subject report the implantation of saphenous vein or PTFE patches, because polyester has always been considered to be a thrombogenic material. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the thrombogenicity of a knitted polyester patch passivated by fluoropolymer surface treatment (FPD patch), which experimental studies have demonstrated to be less thrombogenic than other materials. This prospective, randomized study was performed in 22 patients who underwent CE. In 11 patients the arteriotomy was sutured directly, while in the other 11 an FPD patch was applied. Patients' 111in-oxine labeled platelets were reinjected on the first postoperative day, and scintigraphies were performed after 4, 24, and 48 hr, respectively. The study confirmed that an FPD patch is no more thrombogenic than a simple carotid endarterectomy. The application of the patch, therefore, can be recommended to reduce restenosis without any adjunctive thromboembolic risk.
