The authors enhance the current importance of the hemodynamic evaluation of the vascular carotid territory by means of Doppler-CV although the great development of the "real time" ultra sonographic imaging. Combined US/Doppler-CV technique is really useful in differential diagnosis of the severe obstructive disease of extracranial carotid arteries. The authors report the possibilities of pitfalls in diagnosis due to the limitation of devices employed or to the frequent anatomical variability featured by examination of severe obstruction of vascular carotid territory.
