Echotomography examinations of carotid bifurcation were conducted in 19 patients, with a real-time apparatus (71 crystals, 7 MHz). Serial transversal sections plus two or more longitudinal sections enabled identification by Echo-B of the three carotid arteries, and thus the bifurcation, in 37 instances. Arteriography was performed in 11 patients (21 carotid arteries). Correlation between Echo-B and arteriographic findings was good in 10 cases (including 1 case of occlusion and 2 of stenosis). There were 3 false negatives but no false positives. Echo-B did not detect the bifurcation on either side in one patient. The method is non-invasive, painless, and can be repeated without risk. It enables the detection of stenotic and occlusive lesions with a certain degree of reliability. It is also of value for demonstrating the presence of atheromatous plaques, and to some extent, irregularities in the arterial wall or variations of its diameter. It allows new perspectives for long-term following of patients after medical or surgical treatment.
