With Doppler ultrasonography of the orbit the blood flow in the supratrochlear and supraorbital arteries can be determined transcutaneously. The technique yields reliable informations about the state of the carotid system. It is especially suitable for assessing carotid obstruction. Besides it has proved to be of particular diagnostic value in temporal arteritis. The authors describe and discuss the technique of orbital Doppler ultrasonography and present typical findings in carotid lesions and in temporal arteritis.
