In this pilot study ADP-ase coated polyurethane (PU) vascular prostheses and noncoated (control) PU vascular prostheses (all vascular prostheses: ID 1.5 mm, length 1.5 cm) were implanted into the carotid artery of the rabbit to test whether ADP-ase might function as an adequate anti-thrombogenic coating. The prostheses were evaluated after 1 hour (n = 4) and 3 weeks (n = 8). After 1 hour, there was extensive accumulation of thrombus on the inner surface of the control PU vascular prostheses, in contrast to the ADP-ase coated prostheses. At 3 weeks, all control PU vascular prostheses (n = 8) were occluded, whereas only 1 of the 8 ADP-ase coated PU vascular prostheses. The patient ADP-ase coated PU prostheses showed already extensive endothelial healing. These results indicate the potential of ADP-ase to function as an effective antithrombogenic coating of small-caliber and microvascular PU prostheses.
