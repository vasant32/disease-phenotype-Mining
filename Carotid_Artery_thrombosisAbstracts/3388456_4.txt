We have tested the hypothesis that blood-borne substances released from a site of vascular thrombosis can lead to acute alterations in the blood-brain barrier. The right common carotid artery of rats was photothrombosed using a dye/light insult. Rats were given the photosensitizing dye rose bengal and irradiated for 4 minutes with an argon laser beam focused onto the exposed common carotid artery. During the irradiation, 3 ml of blood was taken from the right external carotid artery. After 10 minutes, the blood was infused into the external carotid artery of a recipient rat that had received horseradish peroxidase. Fifteen minutes after blood infusion, bilateral peroxidase extravasation was noted within cortical and subcortical areas of recipient rats, being most intense ipsilaterally. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated peroxidase reaction product within numerous endothelial vesicles of arteriolar segments. Infusion of blood from control rats did not produce similar changes. Thus, photoinduced vascular thrombosis of a large feeding artery leads to the formation of blood-borne factors that acutely alter cerebral vascular permeability.
