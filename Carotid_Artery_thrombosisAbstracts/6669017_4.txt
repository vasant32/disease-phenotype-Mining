Experiments were carried out to determine the effect of previous irradiation on microvascular arterial anastomoses. The study focused on regeneration of endothelial cells and thrombus formation. Careful examination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a difference between irradiated animals and a control group. In the irradiated group one can notice a decreased regeneration, a greater amount of fibrin and platelets, and a higher incidence of microthrombi.
