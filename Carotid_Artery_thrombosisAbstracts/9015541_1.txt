Numerous clinically relevant animal models exist for thrombosis studies. Few of these are suitable for both arteries and veins. In this investigation, an established venous thrombosis model was adapted through minimal technical adjustments to allow also the study of arterial thrombosis. A standardized subintimal crush injury was performed to carotid arteries or femoral veins of hamsters. Thrombus volumes were then quantified by direct morphometric measurements from serial microscopic sections or by on-line image analysis of light intensity changes from transilluminated vessels. The platelet-rich mural thrombus, which was established within minutes of the trauma, disintegrated during the observation period. The life cycle of the thrombus was different in arteries and veins, but significant linear correlation (p < 0.01) was found in both types of vessel between thrombus volumes measured by the two techniques. The model can consequently be used for comparative in vivo thrombosis studies in small (approximately 1-mm) arteries and veins.
