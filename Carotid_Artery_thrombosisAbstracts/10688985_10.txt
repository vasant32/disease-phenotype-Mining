Coagulation factor Xa is the sole enzyme responsible for activating the zymogen prothrombin to thrombin, resulting in fibrin generation, platelet activation, and subsequent thrombus formation. Our objective was to evaluate the antithrombotic efficacy of the novel factor Xa inhibitor, 2-(3-carbamimidoyl-benzyl)-3-[(3', 4'dimethoxy-biphenyl-4-carbonyl)-amino]-butyric acid methyl ester-trifluoroacetate (RPR208566), in a well-established rat model of arterial thrombosis, and to compare the results with those obtained with argatroban and heparin, direct and indirect inhibitors of thrombin, respectively. Thrombus formation was initiated by placing a filter paper saturated with FeCl(2) on the adventia of the carotid artery for 10 min. Time-to-occlusion was measured from initiation of injury until blood flow reached zero. Formed thrombi were removed and weighed 60 min after the placement of the filter paper. RPR208566, heparin, and argatroban dose-dependently increased time-to-occlusion and reduced thrombus mass. When administered at 500 microgram/kg+50 microgram/kg/min, RPR208566 prolonged time-to-occlusion to 56+/-4 min (vs. 18+/-2 min for vehicle) and reduced thrombus mass to 3.0+/-0.7 mg (vs. 7.3+/-0.6 mg for vehicle). The highest doses of argatroban (500 microgram/kg+50 microgram/kg/min) and heparin (300 U/kg+10 U/kg/min) increased time-to-occlusion to the maximum of 60 min and decreased thrombus mass to 5.5+/-0.8 and 2.6+/-0.3, respectively. The antithrombotic effects of heparin and argatroban at these doses were associated with increases in activated partial thromboplastin time of 5.6+/-0.9- and 2.9+/-0.3-fold over baseline, respectively. However, the highest dose of RPR208566 produced a modest 1.3+/-0.1-fold increase in activated partial thromboplastin time. These results indicate that factor Xa inhibition with compounds such as RPR208566 may be an attractive mechanism for novel antithrombotic drug therapy.
