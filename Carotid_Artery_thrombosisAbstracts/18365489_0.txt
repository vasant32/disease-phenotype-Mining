A new methodological approach is proposed, which involves measurements of (i) the blood flow in vessels under the action of acetylcholine and nitro-L-arginine and (ii) the time of thrombus production as the reaction to iron chloride application on the wall of the vessel. Using this method, it is possible to estimate endothelial dysfunction in experiment.
