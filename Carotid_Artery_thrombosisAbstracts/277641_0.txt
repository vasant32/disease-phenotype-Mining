A case of occlusion of the internal carotid artery after craniocervical trauma with subsequent death of the patient is presented. The patient originally had a mandibular fracture; subsequently an altered sensorium and left-sided hemiparesis developed. The patient died. The typical "lucid interval" was noted. The changes in sensorium are similar to those associated with epidural and subdural hematomas.
