We reported that duplex carotid ultrasonography demonstrated specific mobile intravascular mass in four patients with cardiac cerebral embolism. In all cases, duplex carotid ultrasonography clearly showed the presence of a mobile intravascular mass in the carotid artery within 2 days after the onset. In two of four cases, the follow-up duplex carotid ultrasonography showed disappearance of the previously observed "a mobile intravascular mass" 7 days after the onset. In the other two cases, a mobile intravascular mass became stable gradually and changed to non-mobile hyperechoic mass 10 days after the onset. We think that the intravascular mobile structure was probably a thrombus extending from the occlusive part of the internal carotid artery to the proximal side. We suspect that the specific "a mobile intravascular mass" detected by ultrasonography may help to diagnose embolic internal carotid artery occlusion.
