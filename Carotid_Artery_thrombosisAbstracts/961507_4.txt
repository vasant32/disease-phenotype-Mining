For 10 years, it has been known that operations on vessels 1 mm in diameter are possible. The application of microvascular techniques to neurosurgery demands microscopic and ultrastructural examinations of the effects of such interventions on small vessels. Histological examinations can help to provide answers to questions concerning operating technique, ultrastructural examinations give information on the indications for operation. Since these questions have not been studied previously, preliminary examinations on easily accessible vessels are necessary. For this purpose, the common carotid artery of the rat was chosen. Histological and ultrastructural examinations were carried out on end-to-end anastomoses of these vessels. The ultrastructural findings are described and compared with anatomical findings in normal and abnormal vessels in the rat.
