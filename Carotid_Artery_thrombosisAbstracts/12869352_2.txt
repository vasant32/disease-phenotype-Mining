 OBJECTIVE: Tissue factor (TF) is normally expressed at low levels in the media of blood vessels, but it is readily induced after vessel injury. It is not known whether vascular damage per se or thrombus formation is responsible for this phenomenon. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cyclic flow variations (CFVs), attributable to recurrent thrombus formation, were induced in stenotic rabbit carotid arteries with endothelial injury. CFVs were observed for 30 minutes and 2, 4, and 8 hours in different groups of animals. Another group of rabbits pretreated with hirudin before inducing arterial damage to inhibit thrombus formation was observed for 8 hours. Arterial sections were immunostained for TF. Undamaged arteries served as controls. In additional rabbits, in situ hybridization experiments were performed. No TF expression was observed in the media of control vessels, whereas a progressive increase in TF mRNA and protein expression was observed in carotid arteries as CFVs progressed. No increase in TF expression was observed in animals pretreated with hirudin. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TF mRNA is induced in smooth muscle cells stimulated with activated platelets as well as with some platelet-derived mediators. CONCLUSIONS: This phenomenon may contribute to sustain intravascular thrombus formation after the initial thrombogenic stimulus.
