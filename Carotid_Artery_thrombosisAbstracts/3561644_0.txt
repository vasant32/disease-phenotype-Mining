Seven patients with unilateral arterial carotid occlusion and contralateral arterial carotid stenosis in the neck are reported. Authors perform an extra-cranial to intra-cranial anastomosis on the occluded side prior to realize endarterectomy on the stenosed side. This policy obviates the need of an internal vascular shunt during temporary occlusion of I.C.A.
