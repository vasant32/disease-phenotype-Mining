We have analyzed the clinical course of 31 cases with cerebral infarction for 4 years. Of the 31 patients, 6 cases (19%) showed the brain edema on the cerebral angiograms as manifested by the shift of the midline arteries. The patients were divided into two groups, normotensive (15 cases) and hypertensive cerebral infarction (16 cases). The clinical and angiographic findings in the normotensive groups have been differed significantly from those of the hypertensive groups. The findings of brain edema on the angiograms were prominent in the hypertensive groups, and the clinical course was generally good and fair in the normotensive groups. We have reviewed the literatures about brain edema associated with cerebral infarction and have discussed on the mechanisms. From the study of our cases, it was concluded  that systemic hypertension could be a facilitatory factor in the occurrence of brain edema in cerebral infarction. Furthermore, the management of massive cerebral infarction should be reduction of increased intracranial pressure and prevention of cerebral herniation. So, it will be necessary to perform a surgical treatment such as internal decompression; removal of the infarcted, necrotized area and excision of herniated tissue, and external decompression; removal of boneflap.
