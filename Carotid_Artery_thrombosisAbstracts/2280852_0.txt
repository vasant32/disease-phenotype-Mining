The authors report a clinical experience on 37 internal carotid endarterectomies of 33 patients classified as: group A (asymptomatic patients); 4 patients (13%), group B (RIA); 9 patients (27%), group C (stabilized neurological lesions); 19 patients (56%), group D (acute cerebral ischemia): 1 patient (3%). Sixteen thromboendarterectomies (43%) were carried on for the prophylaxis of neurological lesions, 20 (54%) to increase and balance the cerebral blood flow in patients with stable neurological lesions, 1 (3%) for acute cerebral ischemia. The overall operative mortality was 6%, the operative morbidity was 22%. The clinical follow-up concerned 26 patients: the overall mortality was 19%: in survivors the late results were excellent. The rate of postoperative stenosis was 18%: 80% of these arteries had been treated without a patch angioplasty.
