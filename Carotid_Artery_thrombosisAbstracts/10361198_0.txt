BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that embolization precedes carotid thrombosis, a previously unpredictable event complicating 2-3 per cent of all carotid endarterectomies. It was hypothesized that dextran 40 therapy might prevent progression to complete thrombosis in high-risk patients. METHODS: Between October 1995 and July 1998, 400 consecutive patients were monitored following carotid endarterectomy using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Those with sustained embolization (more than 25 in 10 min) or those with emboli that distorted the middle cerebral artery waveform were commenced on an incremental dextran 40 infusion. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients (54 per cent) had one or more emboli detected (96 per cent within 2 h of flow restoration) but only 15 (4 per cent) required dextran therapy. Embolization ceased in each case although the dextran dose had to be adjusted in four. In one of the latter patients, embolization recurred on day 5 but was again controlled with high-dose dextran. Overall, the death and any stroke rate was 2 per cent and no patient suffered a stroke due to carotid thrombosis. CONCLUSION: A few patients develop sustained embolization following carotid endarterectomy which, in previous studies, has been shown to be highly predictive of carotid thrombosis. The authors' experience to date suggests that dextran can stop this phase of embolization and prevent progression to complete carotid thrombosis. However, the dose of dextran has to be adjusted in 25 per cent of patients (i.e. blind administration of dextran may not be effective) and, very rarely, embolization may recur later.
