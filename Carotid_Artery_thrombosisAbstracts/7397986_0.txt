Ocular pneumoplethysmography is a noninvasive technique for detecting carotid stenosis by measurement of ophthalmic artery pressure. The results of the test were studied in 227 patients who underwent biplane angiography. The overall accuracy was 93% in the correct identification of hemodynamically significant stenosis (defined as a 60% or greater decrease in luminal diameter). The good result of this single test makes it our choice of noninvasive methods for both screening and follow-up study of carotid occlusive disease.
