To determine the time-course of morphological changes after excimer laser treatment of atherosclerotic carotid arteries, laser angioplasty was performed in 34 rabbits after production of an intimal plaque (13 +/- 6 cell layers, 30 +/- 9% stenosis) using electrical stimulations. The animals were sacrificed 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after laser treatment. A total or subtotal thrombotic occlusion was found in four cases. No perforation was observed, but in 10 animals histological examination evidenced a partial ablation of the medial layer with signs of local thrombus formation and local reduction of SMC in the media. In five animals a stenosis of more than 50% of luminal reduction was due to intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC), as determined by a monoclonal antibody against alpha-actin. After the initial ablation, a continuous increase of intimal cell layers was found, from 7 +/- 6 cell layers (19 +/- 9% stenosis) at 7 days, to 28 +/- 5 cell layers (45 +/- 18% stenosis) at 28 days following excimer laser angioplasty (p less than 0.01). After 42 days no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. Our data suggest that incidence and morphology is comparable to the proliferative response of SMC following conventional balloon angioplasty.
