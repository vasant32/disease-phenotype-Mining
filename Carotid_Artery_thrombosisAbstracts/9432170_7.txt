PURPOSE: We assessed the performance of T2-weighted MR imaging in detecting atherosclerotic fibrous caps and in depicting their integrity. METHODS: Twenty atherosclerotic lesions removed by carotid endarterectomy were imaged on a 1.5-T system using T2-weighted spin-echo sequences. The MR images were reviewed independently by four blinded interpreters for fibrous caps and ruptures. The results obtained from the observers were then graded against histologic findings by using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The area under the ROC curve for fibrous cap detection was 0.80, indicating that T2-weighted MR imaging was a good but not definitively diagnostic test for detecting ex vivo fibrous caps. The ROC curve for fibrous cap characterization yielded an area of 0.75, indicating that T2-weighted MR imaging was a fair but not highly diagnostic test for depicting fibrous cap integrity. A definite reading for detection of fibrous caps or rupture was fairly specific (90% and 98%, respectively) but not very sensitive (37% and 12%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: T2-weighted MR imaging of ex vivo atherosclerotic plaques aided in the detection and evaluation of fibrous caps. In both cases, MR imaging proved more useful for ruling out disease than for confirming its presence.
