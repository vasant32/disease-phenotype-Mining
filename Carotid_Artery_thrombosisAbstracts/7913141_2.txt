We present a case where transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring of a carotid endarterectomy enabled us to detect the incipient thrombosis of the operated artery before reversal of anesthesia. The use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring in carotid endarterectomy has the potential to detect this complication before serious neurologic damage has occurred and therefore reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with the operation.
