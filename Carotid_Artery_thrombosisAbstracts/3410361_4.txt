Streptokinase was immobilized on the magnetic carrier at a concentration of 2,000-2,700 IU/ml of preparation. Thrombosis was induced in both canine carotid arteries by means of the vascular wall flap inverting into its lumen. The red, completely occluding thrombus was formed inside the vessel 4-5 h later. A samarium-cobalt magnet was secured externally to one of the arteries. After the clot formation the magnetically immobilized streptokinase was injected intravenously. The preparation concentrated in the region of the magnetic field action caused complete thrombus degradation and normal blood flow restoration; no effect on the clot in the control artery was observed.
