The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of pulsed Doppler spectral analysis and intravenous digital subtraction angiography (IVDSA), in the detection of carotid occlusive disease. In 132 carotid arteries the results of these two examinations have been assessed independently and compared with findings by conventional arteriography. All 39 stenoses causing a diameter reduction of more than 25% were found by Doppler examination and 36 (92%) by IVDSA. Twelve occlusions of the internal carotid artery, shown by conventional arteriography, were also detected by Doppler examination and 11 (92%) by IVDSA. Both Doppler and IVDSA detected 56% of the lesions which reduced the diameter by less than 25%. All 54 arteriographically normal vessels were assessed correctly by Doppler examination and 53 (98%) of them by IVDSA. This study shows that Doppler and IVDSA are well suited for assessing patients with symptoms suggestive of carotid occlusive disease, both methods being accurate in the detection of lesions which reduce the diameter of the carotid artery by more than 25%.
