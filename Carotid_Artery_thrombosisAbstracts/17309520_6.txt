The antithrombotic and antiplatelet activities of Korean red ginseng extract (KRGE) were examined on rat carotid artery thrombosis in vivo and platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. The KRGE significantly prevented rat carotid arterial thrombosis in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of the KRGE to rats significantly inhibited adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo, although it failed to prolong coagulation times such as activated partial thromboplastin and prothrombin time indicating that the antithrombotic effect of the red ginseng may be due to its antiplatelet aggregation rather than anticoagulation effect. In line with the above observations, the red ginseng inhibited the U46619-, arachidonic acid-, collagen- and thrombin-induced rabbit platelet aggregations in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 390 +/- 15, 485 +/- 19, 387 +/- 11 and 335 +/- 15 microg/ml, respectively. Consistently, serotonin secretion was also inhibited by ginseng in the same pattern. These results suggest that the red ginseng has a potent antithrombotic effect in vivo, which may be due to the antiplatelet rather than the anticoagulation activity, and the red ginseng intake may be beneficial for individuals with high risks of thrombotic and cardiovascular diseases.
