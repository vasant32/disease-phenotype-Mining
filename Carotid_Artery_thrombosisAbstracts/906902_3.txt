The observations presented are based on 11 patients who had suffered from stroke caused by internal carotid occlusion. In all cases an anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery (STA) and a cortical temporal branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was done. This resulted in a considerable additional blood supply from the external carotid to the affected middle cerebral circulation. The extent of the territory of the MCA irrigated by the STA depends upon the different anatomical configurations of the MCA. There was a considerable improvement in neurological status even in the chronic post-stroke stage. A topographical correlation between the postoperative angiographically identified increase of rCBF and the recovery or considerable improvement of neurological functions was not ascertained.
