The cerebral blood flow was examined by means of Obrist's 133Xe-inhalational method, cerebral angiography, and computer-aided tomography of the head in 100 patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The findings obtained have revealed a correlation between the level of the compensatory collateral blood supply of the bed of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the source of collateral blood circulation. The authors have demonstrated the vulnerability of the MCA bed secondary to a low level of blood supply persisting despite the functioning of all pathways of the collateral circulation.
