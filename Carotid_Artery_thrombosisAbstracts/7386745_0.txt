A simple and readily available device was used as a shunt during carotid endarterectomy in four cases in which difficulty in inserting a conventional shunt into the internal carotid artery was encountered. It was also used preferentially in one case of external carotid endarterectomy. No apparent injuries occurred in conjunction with its use, and in none of the four patients did neurologic complications develop. For those who wish to use a shunt in all cases of carotid endarterectomy, this device provides an expedient means of shunting in cases in which difficulty in inserting a conventional shunt is encountered.
