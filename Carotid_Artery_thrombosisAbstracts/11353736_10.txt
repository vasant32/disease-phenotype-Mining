We used the setting of clinically indicated internal carotid artery balloon test occlusions in 44 patients with inoperable carotid cavernous aneurysms or head and neck tumours to examine real-time changes in higher cerebral function that correlate with specific levels of cerebral blood flow. By making detailed haemodynamic and neurobehavioural measurements during the 30 min the carotid artery was occluded, we were able to quantify higher cerebral function patterns in relation to absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) levels. We found that once the carotid artery was occluded, patients whose CBF averaged 47 ml/100 g/min (no different from baseline) maintained consistent performance on a sustained attention task; those whose CBF dropped to an average 37 ml/100 g/min had a reversible deterioration of sustained attention, and those whose CBF fell to 27 ml/100 g/min had impaired sustained attention that persisted until the carotid occlusion was reversed. The relevance of these results to the pathological state of clinical stroke is discussed with respect to the haemodynamic and physiological mechanisms that may determine how brain function is lost and regained in the setting of acute cerebral hypoperfusion.
