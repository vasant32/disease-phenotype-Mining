Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery can appear on an angiogram as a total occlusion of this vessel. This appearance differs from that typical of atherothrombotic occlusion. In four patients with spontaneous dissections of internal carotid arteries, serial ocular pneumoplethysmography demonstrated spontaneous restoration to functional patency. Repeated angiography confirmed the noninvasive testing in all four patients.
