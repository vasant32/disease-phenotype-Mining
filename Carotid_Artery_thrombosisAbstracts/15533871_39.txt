 BACKGROUND: Intraplaque hemorrhage and juxtaluminal hemorrhage/thrombus may differ in cause and clinical implications. This study tested the hypothesis that MRI can distinguish between intraplaque hemorrhage and juxtaluminal hemorrhage/thrombus and investigated the association between hemorrhage and underlying lesion types. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were imaged with a 1.5-T GE scanner by a multicontrast-weighted MRI technique. Hemorrhages were identified with previously established MRI criteria, and differentiations were made between intraplaque and juxtaluminal hemorrhage/thrombus. Corresponding histology was used to confirm the magnetic resonance findings. Tissues underlying areas of hemorrhage/thrombus were histologically categorized according to modified American Heart Association criteria. Of 190 matched sections, 140 contained areas of hemorrhage by histology, of which MRI correctly detected 134. The sensitivity and specificity for MRI to correctly identify cross sections that contained hemorrhage were 96% and 82%, respectively. Furthermore, MRI was able to distinguish juxtaluminal hemorrhage/thrombus from intraplaque hemorrhage with an accuracy of 96%. The distribution of lesion types underlying hemorrhages differed significantly (P=0.004). Intraplaque hemorrhage had an underlying lipid-rich type IV/V lesion in 55% of histological sections, whereas juxtaluminal hemorrhage/thrombus had an underlying calcified lesion type VII in 70% of sections. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo high-resolution MRI can detect and differentiate intraplaque hemorrhage from juxtaluminal hemorrhage/thrombus with good accuracy. The association of hemorrhage and lesion types suggests potential differences in origin. Noninvasive MRI therefore provides a possible tool for prospectively studying differences in origin of plaque hemorrhage and the association of plaque progression and instability.
