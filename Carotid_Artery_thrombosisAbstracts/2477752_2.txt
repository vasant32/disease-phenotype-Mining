Unilateral carotid endarterectomy was performed microsurgically in 60 rats. The effects of perioperative administration of aspirin and flunarizine, a Ca2+ entry blocker, on thrombus formation were examined 24 hours after endarterectomy. An untreated group of endarterectomized rats served as controls. Platelet adhesion, blood cells, and fibrin cords were observed at the cut edge of the intima as well as in the endarterectomized area in all three groups. However, these findings were significantly more extensive in the control group than in the drug-treated groups. Flunarizine was as effective as aspirin in inhibiting platelet adhesion and fibrin cord formation. Both drugs significantly increased the patency rate after carotid endarterectomy.
