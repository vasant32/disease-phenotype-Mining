Intracoronary infusion of adenosine is reported to inhibit cyclic flow variations after coronary artery injury and stenosis. This study was performed in the anesthetized dog to determine if adenosine prevents arterial thrombosis and/or reocclusion after thrombolysis. Carotid and coronary arteries were instrumented with Doppler(TM) flow probes, a critical stenosis, infusion line and an anodal electrode. Two protocols were employed. In the thrombosis protocol, intracarotid infusion of adenosine (20 microg/kg/min for 3 h) did not alter cyclic flow variations or patency during induction of vessel wall injury. In the second protocol, occlusive arterial thrombi were induced by anodal current injury and lysed with local application of tissue plasminogen activator. Whereas adenosine prolonged the time to arterial occlusion, it did not affect cyclic flow variations or time to reocclusion after thrombolysis.
