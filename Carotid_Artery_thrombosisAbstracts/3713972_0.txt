Sixty patients with ischaemic stroke were studied observing during the acute period of the disease (10 days) changes in their neurological state in relation to findings in computerized tomography. It was found that in 24 patients with serious state changes prevailed involving nearly the whole lobe in CT. In patients with minor stroke CT demonstrated major lesions with involvement of a whole lobe as well as small deep lesions and cortical foci. In 27 patients the first CT examination demonstrated extensive lesions involving a whole lobe or a hemisphere. In this group clinical manifestations regressed completely in 3 cases within 10 days, in 15 cases an improvement was observed, 3 cases failed to improve and 6 patients died. In 12 cases with small cortical lesions regression of clinical manifestations was observed in 3 patients, 8 patients improved and one failed to improve. These observations showed a certain correlation between the clinical state and CT findings. Prognostic conclusions could be reached, however, only if a correlation existed between the clinical picture and CT. In case of lack of agreement, that is if extensive lesions coexisted with slight clinical changes or small lesions with a serious condition the clinical picture was of greater prognostic significance than CT findings.
