Several authors have reported that salicylate blocks and reverses aspirin inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by platelets and arterial wall. Male rats were given sodium salicylate 15 or 100 mg/kg i.v. 2 min before receiving aspirin, 10 mg/kg i.v. Right and left carotid arteries were injured electrically before and after drug administration and thrombus generation recorded by measuring downstream temperature. Significant antithrombotic effect of aspirin was observed in all cases regardless of prior salicylate administration and the results were similar to those obtained with aspirin alone. Thus competition between salicylate and aspirin as reported in vitro does not appear to significantly affect the in vivo antithrombotic action of aspirin in this model.
