Of 78 patients with an internal carotid artery stenosis a thrombendarterectomy was performed in 46 patients whereas 32 patients were treated by conservative methods. The clinical follow-up over a period of 10 years was investigated. The percentage of patients who received drugs for anticoagulation was equal in both groups. Operated patients acquired a permanent neurologic deficit in 3% and nonoperated patients in 69%. The physical capacity improved in 92% of the operated and in 64% of patients treated conservatively. At the time of reexamination 78% of the operated and 34% of the nonoperated patients were living. The cause of death was cardiac in 42% of both groups and cerebral in 11% of the operated and in 32% of the nonoperated patients.
