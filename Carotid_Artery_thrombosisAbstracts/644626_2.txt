Large intraluminal cervical carotid artery filling defects consistent with mural thrombi were angiographically demonstrated during acute hemispheric neurologic episodes. These thrombi disappeared benignly as shown by serial angiography in 2 patients treated with intravenous heparin and spontaneously in 1 patient treated surgically. Thus, partially obstructing cervical carotid artery thrombi may lyse either with the use of anticoagulant therapy or else spontaneously. The etiology of the thrombi may partly be related to underlying atheromatous disease.
