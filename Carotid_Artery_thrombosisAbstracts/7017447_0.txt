In consecutive 13 cases of the carotid occlusive lesions the carotid thromboendarterectomy was performed with some of our devices as follows: 1) Superior cervical ganglionectomy was added to this operation, bringing efficacy to increase cerebral blood flow. 2) Removal of atheroma plaque en block, as far as possible, shortened the operation time and diminished the arterial wall damage. 3) We could approach to the carotid artery without dissection of the common facial vein by antero-medial retraction of the internal jugular vein. 4) The operation without internal shunt made the technique simple and shortened the operation time. 5) Interlacing vascular suture with microsurgical technique prevented narrowing or shortening of the carotid artery. 6) We used a pair of small needle holders with teeth for anterior wall suture. We could pick up the adventitia easily and exactly, and did not need change of the needle holding with these instruments. 7) Others: The clamping time ranged 15-45 minutes without any neurological deficits.
