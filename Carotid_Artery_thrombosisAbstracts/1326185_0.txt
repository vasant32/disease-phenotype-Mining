Altogether 22 patients with concomitant cardio-cerebral acute pathology underwent all-round examinations during and after sessions of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). The highest clinical effect was produced by minor, substituting doses of HBO. The revealed phasic nature of the action of HBO in the treatment of patients with acute large-focal myocardial infarction and acute cerebrovascular disorders was found to be due to changes in the function of diencephalic and brain stem formations, determining the decrease of adaptation potentialities in this patients' group. HBO was found to be clinically effective in the treatment of such patients. In order to raise the treatment efficacy, it is necessary that an individual approach be exercised in the choice of therapeutic HBO sessions.
