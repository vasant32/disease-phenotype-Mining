Cerebral ischemic lesions were induced in rabbits through internal carotid artery embolization by means of microspheres. Different models of stroke ranging from single focal cortical lesion to massive bilateral brain edema were reproduced and monitored up to the 24th hour by electroencephalogram (EEG and QEEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), cerebral blood flow (CBF), platelet aggregation. The site and extent of the lesions were verified by histological examinations. Results obtained and physiopathological implications are discussed.
