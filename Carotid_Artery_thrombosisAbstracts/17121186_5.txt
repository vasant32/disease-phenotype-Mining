The antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities of Korean Red Ginseng (KRG) were examined on rat carotid artery thrombosis in vivo, and platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. Administration of KRG to rats not only prevented carotid artery thrombosis in vivo in a dose-dependent manner, but also significantly inhibited ADP- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo, while failed to prolong coagulation times such as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT), indicating the antithrombotic effect of KRG might be due to its antiplatelet aggregation rather than anticoagulation effect. In line with the above observations, KRG inhibited U46619-, arachidonic acid-, collagen- and thrombin-induced rabbit platelet aggregation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 620 +/- 12, 823 +/- 22, 722 + 21 and 650 +/- 14 microg/mL, respectively. Accordingly, KRG also inhibited various agonists-induced platelet serotonin secretions as it suppressed platelet aggregation. These results suggest that KRG has a potent antithrombotic effect in vivo, which may be due to antiplatelet rather than anticoagulation activity, and KRG intake may be beneficial to the individuals with high risks of thrombotic and cardiovascular diseases.
