The authors have examined two homogeneous groups of patients suffering from "carotid stenosis", operated by TEAC with two different techniques of anaesthesia: general and local-regional (block). Neurological and cardiovascular complications have been recorded in pre and post-operative period. The results analysed statistically with the Pearson test, were homogeneous. However the authors, on the basis of their experience, prefer local-regional (block) anaesthesia for good haemodynamic stability and a better neurologic control. Moreover the block anaesthesia was better in patients.
