Pulsed Doppler imaging (MAVIS, GEC Medical) of the carotid artery in the neck was compared with selective contrast angiography of 50 arteries. All but one of 23 internal carotid arteries with more than 25% stenosis or complete occlusion on angiography were detected by imaging. One of 17 angiographically normal arteries also had an abnormal image. All 16 arteries thought suitable for endarterectomy had abnormal Doppler images. Imaging of the external carotid artery was less reliable and disease of the common carotid artery was too infrequent to allow imaging to be satisfactorily evaluated. This non-invasive technique may eventually replace selective carotid angiography in some patients.
