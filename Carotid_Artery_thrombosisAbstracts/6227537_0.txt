Thirty-two patients are described. Sixteen patients were treated by local intra-arterial fibrinolysis (LIF) for lesions of the intracranial vessels. In nine patients there was a vertebrobasilar thrombosis, in four patients an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and in three patients a sinus thrombosis. The results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in fourteen patients are reported; they included dilatation of the subclavian artery in 12 and the vertebral artery in two of them. Dilatation of post-operative fibrous stenosis of the internal carotid artery in two patients is described. The technique for local intra-arterial fibrinolysis and recommended doses for streptokinase are given. The use of Doppler sonographic monitoring during PTA is recommended, particularly as for delayed return to normal flow in the vertebral artery.
