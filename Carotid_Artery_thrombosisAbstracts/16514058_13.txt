Bradykinin (BK) liberates nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and tissue plasminogen activator from endothelial cells. We hypothesized that BK B2 receptor knockout (KO) mice (BKB2R(-/-)) have increased thrombosis risk. Paradoxically, the BKB2R(-/-) mice have long bleeding times and delayed carotid artery thrombosis, 78 +/- 6.7 minutes, versus 31 +/- 2.7 minutes in controls. The mechanism(s) for thrombosis protection was sought. In BKB2R(-/-) plasma coagulation, fibrinolysis and anticoagulant proteins are normal except for an increased prekallikrein and decreased factor XI. BKB2R(-/-) mice have elevated BK 1-5 (160 +/- 75 fmol/mL, vs 44 +/- 29 fmol/mL in controls) and angiotensin II (182 +/- 41 pg/mL, vs 49 +/- 7 pg/mL in controls). Ramipril treatment shortens vessel occlusion time. BKB2R(-/-) mice have elevated plasma 6-keto-PGF1alpha (666 +/- 232 ng/mL, vs 23 +/- 5.3 ng/mL in controls) and serum nitrate (61 +/- 5.3 microM, vs 24 +/- 1.8 microM in controls). Treatment with L-NAME (NG-mono-methyl-L-arginine ester) or nimesulide shortens the thrombosis time. BKB2R(-/-) mice have increased angiotensin receptor 2 (AT2R) mRNA and protein expression. Treatment with an AT2R antagonist, PD123 319, normalizes the thrombosis time and nitrate and 6-keto-PGF1alpha. The long bleeding times in BKB2R(-/-) mice also correct with L-NAME and nimesulide therapy. In BKB2R(-/-) mice, angiotensin II binding to an overexpressed AT2R promotes thromboprotection by elevating nitric oxide and prostacyclin. These investigations indicate a pathway for thrombosis risk reduction via the plasma kallikrein/kinin and renin angiotensin systems.
