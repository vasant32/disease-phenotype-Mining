A 25-year-old woman who developed transient neurological abnormalities after scuba diving is reported. The subsequent day she experienced transient left-side monocular blindness. Arterial ocular occlusion in apparently healthy young women is unusual, and a search for the cause of this devastating vascular event is mandatory. Occlusion of the left branch retinal artery, total occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, and a petrous apex epidermoid were found, together with a shortened prothrombin time (INR: 0.73), a slightly elevated serum cholesterol level (6.1 mmol/l) and combined thrombophilia (elevated FVIIIC plus type 2 sticky platelet syndrome). This case underlines the complex mechanism of thromboembolic diseases, and the importance of the acquired trigger (in the present case scuba diving) in addition to the long-term anatomical and biochemical risk factors.
