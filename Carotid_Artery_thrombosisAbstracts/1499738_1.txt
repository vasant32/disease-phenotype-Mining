Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) following internal carotid artery occlusion are not uncommon. Micro-embolisation from an ipsilateral internal carotid artery stump has been implicated in the pathogenesis of such TIAs. We report six patients who had persistent TIAs in association with an occluded ipsilateral internal carotid artery and a carotid stump. Four patients who underwent surgery and stump exclusion remain asymptomatic at 2 years while of two patients who were treated with antiplatelet therapy, one remains asymptomatic and one died from a cerebro-vascular accident.
