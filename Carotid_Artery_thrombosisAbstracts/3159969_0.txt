Various therapeutical procedures in patients with extensive and/or distal stenoses of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are discussed. Possible complications are pointed out, such as cerebral embolism during percutaneous intraluminal angioplasty or symptomatic occlusion of the stenotic segment after extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass operation involving haemodynamic changes. In suitable cases, a combined method of endarterectomy and angioplasty is recommended, and the results of 8 cases treated by this method are reported with a distinct post-operative increase of the ICA blood flow. Follow-up remained without recurrent ischaemic attacks.
