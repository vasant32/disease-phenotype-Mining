72 patients (117 angiographies ) suffering from transient ischemic attacks or prolonged reversible ischemic neurological deficits have been examined to study the diagnostic accuracy of the Doppler-sonography of the supratrochlear artery and of neck bruits. The specificity and sensitivity of the Doppler examination were 91 and 81%. The specificity and sensitivity of carotid bruits were 80 and 60%. The sensitivity increased to 94% when either a neck bruit or a pathological Doppler-test were interpreted to be indicative of carotid occlusive disease.
