We recently applied regional continuous intraarterial infusion of urokinase (UK) for five cases suffering from occlusion of the cervical and intracranial major arteries within nine hours from the onset to the start of infusion. In this paper we reported mainly about a 55-year male patient of occlusion of the left cervical internal carotid artery, which was recanalized by regional continuous intraarterial UK infusion, with discussion about the manipulation of UK infusion, indication of patient and management after recanalization.
