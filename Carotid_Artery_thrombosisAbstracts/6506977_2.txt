Hyperbaric oxygenation is a valuable adjunct to the complex of measures devised to treat patients with ischemic cerebral strokes, including those who have undergone surgical operations on the extracranial portion of the cerebral major vessels. Although the best therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygenation is observed in the acute period of a stroke, its employment may be useful in many patients in the residual period of the stroke as well. The therapeutic action of hyperbaric oxygenation may be due to not only a certain recovery of the function of the damaged neural centres but also to the mobilization of various mechanisms of the CNS compensatory recovery.
