Eight patients with transient ischemic attacks, and three with partial nonprogressive strokes associated with mitral valve prolapse, are reported. No other etiology for their ischemic events was found. Only one episode of ischemia recurred on aspirin treatment, whereas none recurred on sodium warfarin therapy.
