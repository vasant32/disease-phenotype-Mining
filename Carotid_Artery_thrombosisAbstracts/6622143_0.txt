The cerebral arterial occlusion was observed from nine patients aged from 2,5 to 12 years old, between 37 children with acute acquired hemiplegia. The thrombosis had an embolic origin in three cases of cardiopathy. Six patients had primary arterial occlusion, but all these patients were febrile and the onset of hemiplegia was accompanied by seizures in five cases. The site of arterial was demonstrated by the angiography in eight cases: cervical internal carotide in one case of cardiomyopathy, intracranial portion of the internal carotide in four cases, middle and anterior cerebral artery in three cases. The regression of hemiplegia was observed in all but one case of atrial myxoma. The autopsy of this patient revealed renal and hemispheric cerebral arterial thrombosis with myxoma embolus.
