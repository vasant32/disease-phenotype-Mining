A 68-year-old man with acute, total thrombotic occlusion of the right cervical internal carotid artery, associated with embolic occlusion of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, was treated by the endovascular approach, i.e., intra-arterial fibrinolysis and balloon angioplasty. Endovascular treatment for a totally occluded internal carotid artery is indicated in the very early stage where there is no thrombus or a short thrombus that can be evacuated. Fibrinolysis of the associated embolus in the middle cerebral artery, if any, can be done in the same session, enabling an early restoration of the blood flow.
