The paper deals with the condition of intracerebral hemodynamics in patients with occlusive lesions of major extracranial cerebral arteries studied with transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD). A total of 30 patients were studied: 19 with occlusion of internal carotid artery (ICA) or common carotid artery (CCA), 11 with uni- and bilateral kinking. Clinical examination, ultrasound Doppler sonography and Duplex examination of extracranial arteries, TCD, and cerebral angiography were applied. The data suggest that the degree of the developing brain ischemia and the character of clinical manifestations depended on the functional capacities of collateral circulation. Its possible sources and pathways in cases of occlusion of major cerebral arteries are discussed.
