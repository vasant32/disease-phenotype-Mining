Five cases of anastomose formation between the external carotid and the vertebral arteries are reported. In 2 cases occlusion of the vertebral artery in the upper section of the cervical spine were present. In 2 further cases there were occlusions of the external carotid artery. In only a single case did angiographic examination show no pathological change. From these observations it is concluded that, when the formation of such collaterals is established, occlusions and important part-occlusions of the large cervical vessels should be sought.
