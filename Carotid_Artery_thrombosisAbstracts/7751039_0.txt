Elevated levels of serum glycosaminoglycans (GAG), associated with hypomagnesemia were observed in patients of proven CAD and thrombotic stroke in Kerala. Serum lipid profile was normal in the majority of these patients, indicating that elevated serum GAG may be an even more reliable indicator of atherosclerosis than elevated serum total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. Autopsy samples of carotid artery and aorta which had atheroma showed significantly higher GAG when compared to samples which showed no atheroma. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower in CAD and thrombotic stroke patients as compared to controls. Mg deficiency may be one of the factors involved in the increased level of GAG.
