Oculoplethysmography has moved from the noninvasive vascular diagnostic laboratory to the operating room and is serving a new role in monitoring internal carotid shunt blood flow during carotid endarterectomy. Temporary intraoperative shunt occlusions are instantly indicated by accurate ocular pulse delay information digitally displayed to the surgeon. Corrections in shunt placement may be made promptly and, therefore, adequate internal carotid blood flow maintained, allowing "safe" time for careful endarterectomy or vascular reconstruction. Verification of satisfactory flow after arteriorhaphy is obtained by oculoplethysmography.
