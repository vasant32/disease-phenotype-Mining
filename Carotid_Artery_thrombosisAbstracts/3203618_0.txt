The long-term results of carotid endarterectomy were analysed in 119 patients, operated on between January 1979 and December 1980 (135 endarterectomies; preoperative data analysed retrospectively). 43 patients had been in stage I, 39 in stage IIa, 13 in stage IIb, 4 in stage III, and 20 in stage IV. Perioperative mortality was 0.8%, while hospital mortality was 2.5%. Transitory perioperative neurological deficits occurred in 4.2% of all patients, but no permanent ones. Five years postoperatively 44.5% had died, nearly half (43.4%) of cardiovascular disease. Cerebrovascular disease and tumour each caused 15% of deaths. During the five-year follow-up period 12% of all patients had had transitory ischaemic attacks; 16% had suffered a stroke (in 63% on the operated side). With a high prevalence of risk factors, only the quality of diabetic control (mortality rate of well controlled diabetes 38%, of poorly controlled 70%) and the risk factors heart failure and vascular occlusive disease had a significant influence on the mortality rate. But the mortality rate was significantly lowered with the use of platelet aggregation inhibitors (41.6% vs 72.7%).
