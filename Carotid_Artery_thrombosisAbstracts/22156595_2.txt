Bleeding disorders and thrombotic complications constitute a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Although it is known that the complement and coagulation systems interact, no studies have investigated the specific role or mechanisms of lectin-mediated coagulation in vivo. FeCl(3) treatment resulted in intra-arterial occlusive thrombogenesis within 10 min in wild-type (WT) and C2/factor B-null mice. In contrast, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-null and MBL-associated serine protease (MASP)-1/-3 knockout (KO) mice had significantly decreased FeCl(3)-induced thrombogenesis. Reconstitution with recombinant human (rh) MBL restored FeCl(3)-induced thrombogenesis in MBL-null mice to levels comparable to WT mice, suggesting a significant role of the MBL/MASP complex for in vivo coagulation. Additionally, whole blood aggregation demonstrated increased MBL/MASP complex-dependent platelet aggregation. In vitro, MBL/MASP complexes were captured on mannan-coated plates, and cleavage of a chromogenic thrombin substrate (S2238) was measured. We observed no significant differences in S2238 cleavage between WT, C2/factor B-null, MBL-A(-/-), or MBL-C(-/-) sera; however, MBL-null or MASP-1/-3 KO mouse sera demonstrated significantly decreased S2238 cleavage. rhMBL alone failed to cleave S2238, but cleavage was restored when rMASP-1 was added to either MASP-1/-3 KO sera or rhMBL. Taken together, these findings indicate that MBL/MASP complexes, and specifically MASP-1, play a key role in thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo.
