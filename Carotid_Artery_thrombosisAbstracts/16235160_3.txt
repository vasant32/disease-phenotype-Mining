Carotid artery aneurysms represent a very rare cause of pituitary failure. We describe the case of a female patient harbouring a giant aneurysm of the left carotid artery that subsequently led to panhypopituitarism. Interestingly, the late postoperative course was complicated by severe hyponatremia, whose origin may have been due to inappropriate ADH secretion. This case illustrates the problems of diagnosis and postoperative handling of panhypopituitarism due to an intrasellar aneurysm.
