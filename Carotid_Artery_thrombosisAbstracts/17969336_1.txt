We report a case of symptomatic subacute in-stent thrombosis after carotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS). The patient was a 72-year-old man who had severe asymptomatic right carotid artery stenosis. He received CAS with distal protection, and gained 100% opening of the right carotid artery. The administration of dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin 100 mg/day+Cilostazol 100 mg/day), which had been given since two weeks before the procedure, was continued afterwords. On the seventh day after the stent placement, the patient showed sudden onset of left hemiparesis and conjugated deviation of both eyes to the right side and followed by falling into a comatose state. Emergency angiography showed near occlusion of the right carotid artery, suggesting subacute in-stent thrombosis. In conjunction with the intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (1300,000 IU), we performed additional stent placement on the stented portion of the ICA and gained full recanalization of the ICA about three hours after the onset of the symptoms. The patient showed rapid recovery and returned home with slight clumsiness of his right hand. Symptomatic subacute in-stent thrombosis after CAS is a rather rare complication. We discuss on the possible cause of this and stress the necessity of an additional emergency stenting to gain rapid recanalization.
