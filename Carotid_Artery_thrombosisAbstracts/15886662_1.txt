 OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomies (CEAs) with standard polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patching have been shown to have results comparable with those of autogenous vein patching; however, prolonged bleeding through needle holes in PTFE is a commonly recognized problem. This is the first study of CEA using a new hemostatic modified PTFE patch (GORE-TEX) analyzing the early and late outcomes. METHODS: Two hundred consecutive CEAs were entered into this protocol. All patients had an immediate postoperative carotid duplex ultrasound scan that was repeated at 1 month and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the stroke-free survival and the risk of restenosis. The mean follow-up was 21 months (range, 1 to 48 months). RESULTS: The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5% (1% ipsilateral and 0.5% contralateral, two minor strokes and one major stroke) with no perioperative mortality or perioperative carotid thrombosis. The incidence of perioperative transient ischemic attacks was 3.5% (2.5% ipsilateral and 1% contralateral). The mean hemostasis time after completion of the patching was 3 minutes, in contrast to 14 minutes for conventional PTFE (in a previous study). The rates of freedom from ipsilateral strokes at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 99%, 99%, 99%, and 99%, respectively. The cumulative stroke-free survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 98%, 96%, 93%, and 93%, respectively. The rates of freedom from > or =70% restenosis at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 97%, 97%, 94%, and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CEAs with a new modified PTFE patch are safe, have low perioperative stroke rates, are durable, and have an acceptable hemostasis time.
