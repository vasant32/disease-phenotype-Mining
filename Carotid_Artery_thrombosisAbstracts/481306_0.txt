Neck bruits were noticed 86 times in 60 patients. A hemodynamic obstruction of the carotid artery was diagnosed in 22% by Doppler sonography of the supratrochlear artery. The diagnostic directions in case of neck bruits are suggested: 1. In patients with a history of neurological symptoms a pathological Doppler test will be the indication for cerebral angiography. If obstruction of the carotid artery is suspected by clinical examination cerebral angiography should be done in spite of a normal directional Doppler sonography. 2. Cerebral angiography must be done in patients with asymptomatic neck bruits and a pathological Doppler sonography if the patient will undergo a great operation.
