Fifty-one patients, on whom a total of 64 carotid thromboendarterectomies had been performed, were followed up by duplex sonography. Five asymptomatic occlusions of the internal carotid artery (8%) and one occlusion of the common carotid artery were found. Two patients (3%) developed a restenosis of more than 50% and another two patients a restenosis of less than 50%. Changes in the vessel wall not producing significant luminal change were observed in another 18 cases (28%). Thirty-six of the operated vessels (56%) showed no change.
