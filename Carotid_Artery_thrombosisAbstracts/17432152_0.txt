 OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and the mechanism of Xuesaitong drop pills (total saponins in Radix Notoginseng; XDP) on experimental thrombosis, thrombolysis and blood theology. METHOD: First, the rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, XDP (90, 30, 10 mg x kg(-1)), Xuesaitong tablet (XP) 30 mg x kg(-1). Then the effect of the drugs on thrombus and thrombosis was studied after the ratsthrombosis was induced by the arteriovenous shunt. Second, the rats were randomly divided into seven groups: model, XDP (90, 30, 10 mg x kg(-1)), XT (90, 30 mg x kg(-1)), lumbrukinase capsule. Then the effect of the drugs on thrombus and thrombosis was studied after the rats'thrombosis was induced by the electrical stimulation of common carotid artery. Third, the rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, model, XDP (80, 40 mg x kg(-1)), XT (40, 20 mg x kg(-1)). Then the effect of the drugs on blood circulation promoting was observed after the rats'acute blood stasis induced by adrenalin and icy water. RESULT: XDP 90, 30 mg x kg(-1) could notably lighten the wet-weight and dry-weight of thrombus in the arteriovenous shunt model in rats in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). XDP 90 mg x kg(-1) with intragastric administration for 3 days had the satisfactory effect on thrombolysis after the rat's thrombosis was induced by the electrical stimulation of common carotid artery (P < 0.01). XDP 80, 40 , 20 mg x kg(-1) reduced significantly erythrocyte aggregation (P < 0.01) and decreased the whole blood viscosity at low shear rate (P < 0.05). XDP 80, 40 mg x kg(-1) reduced the whole blood viscosity at high shear rate and plasma viscosity (P < 0.05). XDP 80 mg x kg(-1) decreased the whole blood viscosity at high shear rate (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: XDP can significantly inhibit the thrombosis and has the satisfactory effect on thrombolysis. One kind of the mechanism is related to the effect on blood rheology.
