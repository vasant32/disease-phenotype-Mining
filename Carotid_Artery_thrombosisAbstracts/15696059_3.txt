A case of a symptomatic free-floating thrombus of the internal carotid artery is described. A 51-year-old woman presented with a transient ischemic attack and was placed on anticoagulation after diagnosis with angiography. After medical therapy failed, she underwent suction embolectomy using reversal of flow with the Parodi Anti-Embolism System. Balloon angioplasty was performed, and a stent was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. A follow-up carotid ultrasound scan showed resolution of the thrombus.
