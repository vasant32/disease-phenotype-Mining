<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>Metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> and targeted treatment trials have been reported for several neurobehavioral disorders but are relatively understudied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether or not treatment with the metabolic precursors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28115">methylcobalamin</z:chebi> and folinic acid, would improve plasma concentrations of transmethylation/transsulfuration metabolites and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> redox status in autistic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In an open-label trial, 40 autistic children were treated with 75 microg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28115">methylcobalamin</z:chebi> (2 times/wk) and 400 microg folinic acid (2 times/d) for 3 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Metabolites in the transmethylation/transsulfuration pathway were measured before and after treatment and compared with values measured in age-matched control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results indicated that pretreatment metabolite concentrations in autistic children were significantly different from values in the control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-mo intervention resulted in significant increases in cysteine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4047">cysteinylglycine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> concentrations (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> was decreased and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> redox ratio increased after treatment (P &lt; 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although mean metabolite concentrations were improved significantly after intervention, they remained below those in unaffected control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The significant improvements observed in transmethylation metabolites and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> redox status after treatment suggest that targeted nutritional intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28115">methylcobalamin</z:chebi> and folinic acid may be of clinical benefit in some children who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This trial was registered at (clinicaltrials.gov) as NCT00692315 </plain></SENT>
