<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> is a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> that usually presents in early childhood and that is thought to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>abnormal metabolism</z:mp> of methionine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> has been associated with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e>, these pathways have not been evaluated in persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma concentrations of metabolites in the methionine transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways in children diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Plasma concentrations of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (<z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>, cysteine, and oxidized and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> were measured in 20 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and in 33 control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the abnormal metabolic profile, a targeted nutritional intervention trial with folinic acid, betaine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28115">methylcobalamin</z:chebi> was initiated in a subset of the autistic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to the control children, the children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> had significantly lower baseline plasma concentrations of methionine, <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi>, cysteine, and total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> and significantly higher concentrations of SAH, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, and oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This metabolic profile is consistent with impaired capacity for methylation (significantly lower ratio of <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi> to SAH) and increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (significantly lower redox ratio of reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> to oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intervention trial was effective in normalizing the metabolic imbalance in the autistic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An increased vulnerability to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and a decreased capacity for methylation may contribute to the development and clinical manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
