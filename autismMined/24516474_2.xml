<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature and registered clinical trials on pharmacologic interventions targeting social <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460,C0566027" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">communication impairment</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>Autism Spectrum Disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive search of several databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Clinical trials.gov) was conducted to identify pharmacologic agents that have been, or will be, tested as treatments for social <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009460,C0566027" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">communication impairment</z:e> in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence from basic science research supporting rational drug discovery is surveyed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from animal models and early clinical trials suggest that novel and existing compounds, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) modulators, Î³-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor (mGluR) <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and neuropeptides, may enhance social communication/function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from numerous Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials are expected in the near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recent evidence suggests that social communication may be an appropriate target for pharmacologic manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that, in combination with behavioural interventions, novel therapeutics may soon be clinically available to help improve social outcomes </plain></SENT>
