<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> comprises a spectrum of behavioral and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disturbances</z:e> of childhood development and is known to be highly heritable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although numerous approaches have been used to identify genes implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, less than 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> cases have been attributed to single gene disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe the use of high-resolution genome-wide tilepath microarrays and comparative genomic hybridization to identify copy number variants within 119 probands from multiplex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We next carried out DNA methylation analysis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing in a proband and his family, expanding this analysis to methylation analysis of peripheral blood and temporal cortex DNA of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> cases and matched controls from independent datasets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also assessed <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> receptor (OXTR) gene expression within the temporal cortex tissue by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a genomic deletion containing the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> receptor gene, OXTR (MIM accession no.: 167055), previously implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, was present in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> proband and his mother who exhibits symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proband's affected sibling did not harbor this deletion but instead may exhibit epigenetic misregulation of this gene through aberrant gene silencing by DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further DNA methylation analysis of the CpG island known to regulate OXTR expression identified several CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> that show independent statistically significant increases in the DNA methylation status in the peripheral blood cells and temporal cortex in independent datasets of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> as compared to control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associated with the increase in methylation of these CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> is our finding that OXTR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed decreased expression in the temporal cortex tissue of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> cases matched for age and sex compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Together, these data provide further evidence for the role of OXTR and the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> signaling pathway in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and, for the first time, implicate the epigenetic regulation of OXTR in the development of the disorder.See the related commentary by Gurrieri and Neri: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/7/63 </plain></SENT>
