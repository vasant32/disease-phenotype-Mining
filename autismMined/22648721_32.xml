<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> intake was examined in relation to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> (DD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Families enrolled in the CHARGE (CHildhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> Risks from Genetics and Environment) Study from 2003 to 2009 were included if their child had a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> (n = 429), DD (n = 130), or typical development (TD; n = 278) confirmed at the University of California Davis Medical Investigation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Neurodevelopmental Disorders</z:e> Institute by using standardized clinical assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average daily <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> was quantified for each mother on the basis of dose, brands, and intake frequency of vitamins, supplements, and breakfast cereals reported through structured telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean (±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> intake was significantly greater for mothers of TD children than for mothers of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> in the first month of pregnancy (P1; 779.0 ± 36.1 and 655.0 ± 28.7 μg, respectively; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mean daily <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> intake of ≥600 μg (compared with &lt;600 μg) during P1 was associated with reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> risk (adjusted OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.92; P = 0.02), and risk estimates decreased with increased <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (P-trend = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> risk was strongest for mothers and children with MTHFR 677 C&gt;T variant genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A trend toward an association between lower maternal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> intake during the 3 mo before pregnancy and DD was observed, but not after adjustment for confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Periconceptional <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> may reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> risk in those with inefficient <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The replication of these findings and investigations of mechanisms involved are warranted </plain></SENT>
