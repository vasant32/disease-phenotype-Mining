<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Graph theory has been recently introduced to characterize complex brain networks, making it highly suitable to investigate altered connectivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A current model proposes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) as a developmental disconnection syndrome, supported by converging evidence in both non-syndromic and syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of abnormal connectivity on network properties have not been well studied, particularly in syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To close this gap, brain functional networks of electroencephalographic (EEG) connectivity were studied through graph measures in patients with Tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>Sclerosis</z:mp> Complex (TSC), a disorder with a high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, as well as in patients with non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: EEG data were collected from TSC patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> (n = 14) and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> (n = 29), from patients with non-syndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> (n = 16), and from controls (n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, EEG connectivity was characterized by the mean coherence, the ratio of inter- over intra-hemispheric coherence and the ratio of long- over short-range coherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, graph measures of the functional networks were computed and a resilience analysis was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To distinguish effects related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> from those related to TSC, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied, using age as a covariate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of network properties revealed differences specific to TSC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, and these differences were very consistent across subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In TSC, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, mean coherence, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were decreased and the average path length was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate an altered network topology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of TSC, decreased long- over short-range coherence and markedly increased network resilience were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The altered network topology in TSC represents a functional correlate of structural abnormalities and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The increased resilience in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> may reflect an excessively degenerate network with local overconnection and decreased functional specialization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This joint study of TSC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> networks provides a unique window to common neurobiological mechanisms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
