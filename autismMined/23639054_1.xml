<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, the hypothesis that a suite of core <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>-related traits may commonly represent simple delays or non-completion of typical childhood developmental trajectories is evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that, with regard to the four phenotypes of (1) restricted interests and repetitive behavior, (2) short-range and long-range structural and functional brain connectivity, (3) global and local visual perception and processing, and (4) the presence of absolute pitch, the differences between autistic individuals and typically developing individuals closely parallel the differences between younger and older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The results of this study are concordant with a model of 'developmental heterochrony', and suggest that evolutionary extension of child development along the human lineage has potentiated and structured genetic risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and the expression of autistic perception, cognition and behavior </plain></SENT>
