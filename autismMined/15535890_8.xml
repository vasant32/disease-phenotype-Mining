<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been concern that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorders</z:hpo> (PDDs) is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have been smaller, restricted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> (excluding other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorders</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Asperger's syndrome</z:e>), included boys only, or have not been based on a national sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated time trends in the rates of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed the rates of first diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorders</z:hpo> among people registered with a practice contributing to the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database during the period 1988 to 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We included 1410 cases from over 14 million person-years of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were rates of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorders</z:hpo> by year of diagnosis, year of birth, gender and geographical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rate increased progressively from 0.40/10,000 person-years (95% CI 0.30 to 0.54) in 1991 to 2.98/10,000 (95% CI 2.56 to 3.47) in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar change occurred in the age standardised incidence ratios, from 35 (95% CI: 26-47) in 1991 to 365 (95% CI: 314-425) in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The temporal increase was not limited to children born during specific years nor to children diagnosed in a specific time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of diagnosis of PDDs other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> rose from zero for the period 1988-1992 to 1.06/10,000 person-years in 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> also increased but to a lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was marked geographical variation in rates, with standardised incidence ratios varying from 66 for Wales to 141 for the South East of England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Better ascertainment of diagnosis is likely to have contributed to the observed temporal increase in rates of diagnosis of PDD, but we cannot exclude a real increase </plain></SENT>
