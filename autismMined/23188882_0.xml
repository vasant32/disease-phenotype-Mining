<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined this question and investigated patterns of co-occurrence of broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype traits within families of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pragmatic language and personality features of the broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype were studied in 42 fathers and 50 mothers of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> using direct assessment tools used in prior family studies of the broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Higher rates of aloof personality style were detected among fathers, while no sex differences were detected for other broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within individuals, pragmatic language features were associated with the social personality styles of the broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype in mothers but not in fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype features were correlated within spousal pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the associations were detected between paternal broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype characteristics and the severity of children's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three domains (social, communication, and repetitive behaviors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mother-child correlations were detected for aspects of communication only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, the findings suggest that most features of the broad <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype express comparably in males and females and raise some specific questions about how such features might inform studies of the genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
