<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three core domains of functioning are affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e>, ie, socialization, communication, and behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> may be present early, but are frequently overlooked, resulting in a delay in its diagnosis and a subsequent delay in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No one definitive therapy is available, and treatment consists of early educational and behavioral interventions, as well as drug therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi> have often been used in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> to target <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100716'>self-injurious behavior</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which can interfere with other aspects of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One atypical antipsychotic, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">aripiprazole</z:chebi>, has recently been approved for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the results from two randomized, controlled trials, with efficacy data from nearly 300 patients, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">aripiprazole</z:chebi> was associated with reductions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, global improvements in behavior, and improvements in quality of life from both the patient and caregiver perspectives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">aripiprazole</z:chebi> ranged from 5 mg to 15 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">Aripiprazole</z:chebi> was well tolerated during clinical trials, with most adverse events considered mild or moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically relevant <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> occurred in about 30% of patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">aripiprazole</z:chebi>, although when compared with other atypical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35476">antipsychotics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">aripiprazole</z:chebi> appears to have fewer metabolic effects and a lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, pediatric patients taking any atypical antipsychotic should be carefully monitored for potential adverse events, because the long-term effects of antipsychotic therapy in this population are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When used appropriately, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31236">aripiprazole</z:chebi> has the potential to be an effective treatment for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> and improve quality of life </plain></SENT>
