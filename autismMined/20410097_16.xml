<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> is a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> that is increasingly being recognized as a public health issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has emerged that children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> may have altered <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> or methionine metabolism, which suggests the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine cycle may play a key role in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective was to conduct a systematic review to examine the evidence for the involvement of alterations in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine metabolism in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A systematic literature review was conducted of studies reporting data for metabolites, interventions, or genes of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria, 17 of which provided data on metabolites, 5 on interventions, and 6 on genes and their related polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The findings of the review were conflicting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variance in results can be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, sampling issues, and the wide range of analytic techniques used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most genetic studies were inadequately powered to provide more than an indication of likely genetic relations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The review concluded that further research is required with appropriately standardized and adequately powered study designs before any definitive conclusions can be made about the role for a dysfunctional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine pathway in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is also a need to determine whether functional benefits occur when correcting apparent deficits in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-methionine metabolism in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
