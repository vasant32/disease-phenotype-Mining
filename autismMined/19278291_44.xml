<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between paternal age and performance on neurocognitive measures during infancy and childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: A sample of singleton children (n = 33,437) was drawn from the US Collaborative Perinatal Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome measures were assessed at 8 mo, 4 y, and 7 y (Bayley scales, Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale, Graham-Ernhart Block Sort Test, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Wide Range Achievement Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main analyses examined the relationship between neurocognitive measures and paternal or maternal age when adjusted for potential confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Advanced paternal age showed significant associations with poorer scores on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the neurocognitive measures apart from the Bayley Motor score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings were broadly consistent in direction and effect size at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, advanced maternal age was generally associated with better scores on these same measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The offspring of older fathers show subtle impairments on tests of neurocognitive ability during infancy and childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In light of secular trends related to delayed fatherhood, the clinical implications and the mechanisms underlying these findings warrant closer scrutiny </plain></SENT>
