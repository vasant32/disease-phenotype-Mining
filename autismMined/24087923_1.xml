<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A convenience sample included 162 preschool children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> ages 36 to 72 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The raters collected data using the ICF-CY-based questionnaire as an instrument to construct the structural equation modeling of factors associated with participation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The internal structure of the model was acceptable, indicating that the observed variables would suffice in accounting for latent variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The structural model showed that the performance of participation in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> was influenced by body functions and personal factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the variables accounted for 77% of the explained variance for activities and for participation by 71% of the children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings may provide critical information pertaining to predictive factors of participation for parents, educators, and professionals who work with children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
