<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability to determine an infant's likelihood of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> via a relatively simple neurological measure would constitute an important scientific breakthrough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In their recent publication in this journal, Bosl and colleagues claim that a measure of EEG complexity can be used to detect, with very high accuracy, infants at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the surface, this appears to be that very scientific breakthrough and as such the paper has received widespread media attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But a close look at how these high accuracy rates were derived tells a very different story </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This stems from a conflation between "high risk" as a population-level property and "high risk" as a property of an individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe the approach of Bosl et al. and examine their results with respect to baseline prevalence rates, the inclusion of which is necessary to distinguish infants with a biological risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> from typically developing infants with a sibling with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is an important distinction that should not be overlooked </plain></SENT>
