<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A randomised group comparison design involving a parent education and counselling intervention and a parent education and behaviour management intervention to control for parent skills training and a control sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two rural and two metropolitan regions were randomly allocated to intervention groups (n = 70) or control (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parents from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> assessment services in the intervention regions were randomly allocated to parent education and behaviour management (n = 35) or parent education and counselling (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Parent education and behaviour management resulted in significant improvement in adaptive behaviour and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> symptoms at 6 months follow-up for children with greater delays in adaptive behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parent education and behaviour management was superior to parent education and counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a 20-week parent education programme including skills training for parents of young children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> provides significant improvements in child adaptive behaviour and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> for low-functioning children </plain></SENT>
