<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over this time, and particularly over the past two decades, noteworthy changes have occurred in how the condition is conceptualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we provide an overview of these changes, beginning with a brief discussion of the significance of classification in general before discussing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Kanner</z:e>'s original paper and subsequent changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting) </plain></SENT>
