<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We now know that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is associated with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> and activation of cell-mediated immunity, as well as activation of the compensatory anti-inflammatory reflex system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is similarly accompanied by increased oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&amp;NS), which contribute to neuroprogression in the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The obvious question this poses is 'what is the source of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>?' DISCUSSION: This review explores the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and oxidative and nitrosative stress as possible mediators of known environmental risk factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and discusses potential implications of these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A range of factors appear to increase the risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and seem to be associated with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>; these include psychosocial stressors, poor diet, physical inactivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, smoking, altered gut permeability, atopy, dental cares, sleep and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The identification of known sources of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> provides support for <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> as a mediating pathway to both risk and neuroprogression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Critically, most of these factors are plastic, and potentially amenable to therapeutic and preventative interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, of the above mentioned sources of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may play a role in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038436" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="PTSD">post-traumatic stress disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
