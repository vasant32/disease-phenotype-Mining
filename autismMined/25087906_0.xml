<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some studies have reported that <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation could be associated with a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, and therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review of studies involving relationships between this molecule and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MEDLINE database was searched for studies written in English which evaluated the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The initial search yielded 60 potentially relevant articles, of which 11 met the inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The agreement between reviewers was κ = 0.808 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The articles included in the present study addressed topics related to the prescription of vitamins, the association between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> intake/supplementation during pregnancy and the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, food intake, and/or nutrient supplementation in children/adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, the evaluation of serum nutrient levels, and nutritional interventions targeting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding our main issue, namely the effect of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation, especially in pregnancy, the few and contradictory studies present inconsistent conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological associations are not reproduced in most of the other types of studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although some studies have reported lower <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, the effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>-enhancing interventions on the clinical symptoms have yet to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
