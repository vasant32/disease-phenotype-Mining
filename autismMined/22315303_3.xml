<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A secondary analysis of 14 published observational studies of perinatal risk factors for type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk estimates of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by category of interbirth interval were calculated for each study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 2,787 children with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
