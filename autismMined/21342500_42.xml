<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such endophenotypes may be measurable biomarkers for later <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nonlinear complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is believed to contain information about the architecture of the neural networks in the brain on many scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early detection of abnormalities in EEG signals may be an early biomarker for developmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the modified multiscale entropy (mMSE) computed on the basis of resting state EEG data can be used as a biomarker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain development and distinguish typically developing children from a group of infants at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>), defined on the basis of an older sibling with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using mMSE as a feature vector, a multiclass support vector machine algorithm was used to classify typically developing and high-risk groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Classification was computed separately within each age group from 6 to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multiscale entropy appears to go through a different developmental trajectory in infants at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HRA</z:e>) than it does in typically developing controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differences appear to be greatest at ages 9 to 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using several machine learning algorithms with mMSE as a feature vector, infants were classified with over 80% accuracy into control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HRA</z:e> groups at age 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Classification accuracy for boys was close to 100% at age 9 months and remains high (70% to 90%) at ages 12 and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For girls, classification accuracy was highest at age 6 months, but declines thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle study suggests that mMSE computed from resting state EEG signals may be a useful biomarker for early detection of risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> and abnormalities in cognitive development in infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an information theoretic analysis of EEG data for biomarkers in infants at risk for a complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
