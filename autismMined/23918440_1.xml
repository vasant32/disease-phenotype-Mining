<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It was 126 years ago that Down first described <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">savant syndrome</z:e> as a specific condition and 70 years ago that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Kanner</z:e> first described Early Infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While as many as one in ten autistic persons have savant abilities, such special skills occur in other <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> conditions as well such that approximately 50 % of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">savant syndrome</z:e> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> as the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disability</z:e> and 50 % are associated with other disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper sorts out realities from myths and misconceptions about both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">savant syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) that have developed through the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reality is that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848034" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">low IQ</z:e> is not necessarily an accompaniment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">savant syndrome</z:e>; in some cases IQ can be superior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, savants can be creative, rather than just duplicative, and the skills increase over time on a continuum from duplication, to improvisation to creation, rather than diminishing or suddenly disappearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genius and prodigy exist separate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">savant syndrome</z:e> and not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such highly gifted persons have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Asperger's Disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This paper also emphasizes the critical importance of separating 'autistic-like' symptoms from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> especially in children when the savant ability presents as hyperlexia (children who read early) or as Einstein syndrome (children who speak late), or have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>impaired vision</z:hpo> (Blindisms) because prognosis and outcome are very different when that careful distinction is made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In those cases the term 'outgrowing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>' might be mistakenly applied when in fact the child did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> in the first place </plain></SENT>
