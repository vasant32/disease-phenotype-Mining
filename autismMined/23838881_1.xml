<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> is a complex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> neurobehavioral disorder with many causes and varying degrees of severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some genetic implications related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> may involve gene-regulatory processes such as alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we assess the feasibility of profiling exon-level gene expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> using the Affymetrix Human exon 1.0 ST array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined lymphoblastoid cell line-derived <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> from five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> compared with five controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple test correction identified 57 genes exhibiting differential exon-level expression, suggesting potential changes in the resultant alternatively spliced transcripts in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genes with differentially expressed exons included CYFIP1, a previously reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> susceptibility gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, several genes recently reported to have deregulated alternative splicing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> brain samples showed differential exon expression in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The paucity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> brain samples and extensive phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> demands finding ways to also identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>-related genomic events in accessible nonbrain resources, which may contribute in biomarker identifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This proof-of-concept study shows that the analysis of alternative splicing in lymphoblastoid cell line samples has a potential to reveal at least a subset of brain-related deregulation of splicing machinery that might be implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
