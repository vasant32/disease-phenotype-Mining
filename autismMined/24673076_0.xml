<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four children of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> were randomly divided into a tongue acupuncture group (group A) and a conventional training group (group B), 42 cases in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The behavior training and sensory integration training were carried out in group B and the ETTAA was added in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The apparatus was switched on for 20 min every time and 3 times a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of two months were carried out in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The score of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> rating scale (CARS) and clinical efficacy in both groups were observed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, the CARS in both groups were significantly reduced (42.39 +/- 6.86 vs 32.15 +/- 5.12, P &lt; 0.001; 44.58 +/- 6.76 vs 39.72 +/- 7.11, P &lt; 0.05), which was more significant in group A (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The totally effective rate in group A [90.5% (38/42)] was superior to that in group B [66.7% (28/42), P &lt; 0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy in tongue acupuncture group is apparently superior to that in conventional training group, ETTAA combined with conventional training have a better curative effect in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
