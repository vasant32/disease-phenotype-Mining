<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, recently it has been shown that echoes may serve interactional goals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article, which presents a case study of a six-year-old child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, examines how social interaction organizes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0010529'>echolalia</z:hpo> and how repetitive speech responds to discernible interactional trajectories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using linguistic, discourse, and acoustic analyses, we demonstrate that the child is able to mobilize <z:hpo ids='HP_0010529'>echolalia</z:hpo> to mark different stances, through the segmental and suprasegmental modulation of echoes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We offer an interpretive framework that deepens our understanding of the complex interactions that children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> can engage in by using echoes, and discuss the implications of this perspective for current views of atypical language development in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
