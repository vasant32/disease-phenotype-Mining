<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to appraise which interventions for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disabilities</z:hpo> or lower-functioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> delivered by non-specialist care providers in community settings produce benefits when compared to either a no-treatment control group or treatment-as-usual comparator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND FINDINGS: We systematically searched electronic databases through 24 June 2013 to locate prospective controlled studies of psychosocial interventions delivered by non-specialist providers to children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disabilities</z:hpo> or lower-functioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened 234 full papers, of which 34 articles describing 29 studies involving 1,305 participants were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A majority of the studies included children exclusively with a diagnosis of lower-functioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> (15 of 29, 52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of twenty-nine studies (52%) were randomized controlled trials and just under half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> effect sizes (29 of 59, 49%) were greater than 0.50, of which 18 (62%) were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For behavior analytic interventions, the best outcomes were shown for development and daily skills; cognitive rehabilitation, training, and support interventions were found to be most effective for improving developmental outcomes, and parent training interventions to be most effective for improving developmental, behavioral, and family outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also conducted additional subgroup analyses using harvest plots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Limitations include the studies' potential for performance bias and that few were conducted in lower- and middle-income countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review support the delivery of psychosocial interventions by non-specialist providers to children who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disabilities</z:hpo> or lower-functioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Given the scarcity of specialists in many low-resource settings, including many lower- and middle-income countries, these findings may provide guidance for scale-up efforts for improving outcomes for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e> or lower-functioning <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
