<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diathesis-stress model of psychiatric conditions has recently been challenged by the view that it might be more accurate to speak of 'differential susceptibility' or 'plasticity' genes, rather than one-sidedly focusing on individual vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>That is, the same allelic variation that predisposes to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychiatric disorder</z:e> if associated with (developmentally early) environmental adversity may lead to a better-than-average functional outcome in the same domain under thriving (or favourable) environmental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of polymorphic variations of the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> transporter gene, the monoamino-oxidase-inhibitor A coding gene or the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D4 receptor gene indicate that the early environment plays a crucial role in the development of favourable versus unfavourable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current evidence is limited, however, to establishing a link between genetic variation and behavioural phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, little is known about how plasticity may be expressed at the neuroanatomical level as a 'hard-wired' correlate of observable behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present review article seeks to further strengthen the argument in favour of the differential susceptibility theory by incorporating findings from behavioural and neuroanatomical studies in relation to genetic variation of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> receptor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that polymorphic variation at the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="7872">oxytocin</z:chebi> receptor gene (rs2254298) is associated with sociability, amygdala volume and differential risk for psychiatric conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> disorder, depending on the quality of early environmental experiences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seeing genetic variation at the core of developmental plasticity can explain, in contrast to the diathesis-stress perspective, why evolution by natural selection has maintained such 'risk' alleles in the gene pool of a population </plain></SENT>
