<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hyperserotoninaemia in 43.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> 43% and hyperpyruvataemia in 30% were biochemically demonstrated in autistic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our earlier results led to the postulation that a dissequilibrium in the blood redox is involved in infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>; the oxidative loading and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defending enzyme system were investigated together with the hemorheological parameters in infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25134,50650">Malonyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="38124">dialdehyde</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) endproduct of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and activities of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (C-ase), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GP-ase) and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) were biochemically determined from plasma and red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> specificities were investigated in plasma and red blood cell haemolysate from 25 infantile autistic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) (2.89 vs. 1.32 U/mg protein, p &lt; 0.01) and decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (0.620 vs. 0.910 U/mg protein, p &lt; 0.01) levels as well as catalase (0.463 vs. 4.948 BU/mg protein, p &lt; 0.001) activities were detected; while the plasma and erythrocyte <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and the reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) levels did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the investigated prooxidant and the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status provide evidence that there exists an <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in children with infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While investigating the hemorheological parameters of 25 infantile autistic patients, some characteristic pathological parameters were detected: the initial filtration rate (Fi) (0.72 vs. 0.75 p &lt; 0.01) and the clogging rate (CR) (1.926 vs. 2.912, p &lt; 0.01) values of red blood cells (RBC) decreased while the mean transit time (Tc) (8.93 vs. 7.39, p &lt; 0.001) increased suggesting reduced RBC deformability </plain></SENT>
