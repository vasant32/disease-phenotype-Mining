<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> has a wide range of functions; it is an endogenous anti-oxidant and plays a key role in the maintenance of intracellular redox balance and detoxification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have indicated that children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> may have altered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> metabolism which could play a key role in the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies examining metabolites, interventions and/or genes of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> metabolism pathways i.e. the γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> cycle and trans-sulphuration pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty nine studies were included in the review comprising an in vitro study, thirty two metabolite and/or co-factor studies, six intervention studies and six studies with genetic data as well as eight studies examining enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The review found evidence for the involvement of the γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> cycle and trans-sulphuration pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> is sufficiently consistent, particularly with respect to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> redox ratio, to warrant further investigation to determine the significance in relation to clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large, well designed intervention studies that link metabolites, cofactors and genes of the γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> cycle and trans-sulphuration pathway with objective behavioural outcomes in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future risk factor analysis should include consideration of multiple nutritional status and metabolite biomarkers of pathways linked with the γ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamyl</z:chebi> cycle and the interaction of genotype in relation to these factors </plain></SENT>
