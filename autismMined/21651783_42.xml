<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compares the nutritional and metabolic status of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> with that of neurotypical children and investigates the possible association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> severity with biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Participants were children ages 5-16 years in Arizona with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524528" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Autistic Spectrum Disorder</z:e> (n = 55) compared with non-sibling, neurotypical controls (n = 44) of similar age, gender and geographical distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neither group had taken any vitamin/mineral supplements in the two months prior to sample collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> severity was assessed using the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524528" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Pervasive Development Disorder</z:e> Behavior Inventory (PDD-BI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> Scale (SAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study measurements included: vitamins, biomarkers of vitamin status, minerals, plasma amino acids, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, and biomarkers of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, methylation, sulfation and energy production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biomarkers of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> compared to those of controls using a t-test or Wilcoxon test found the following statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.001): Low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, RBC <z:chebi fb="75" ids="15414">SAM</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi>, plasma ATP, RBC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>, RBC <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (free and total), and plasma tryptophan; also high levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers and plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of biomarkers for the neurotypical controls were in good agreement with accessed published reference ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> group, mean levels of vitamins, minerals, and most amino acids commonly measured in clinical care were within published reference ranges.A stepwise, multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated significant associations between several groups of biomarkers with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> severity scales, including vitamins (adjusted R2 of 0.25-0.57), minerals (adj </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>R2 of 0.22-0.38), and plasma amino acids (adj </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>R2 of 0.22-0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> group had many statistically significant differences in their nutritional and metabolic status, including biomarkers indicative of vitamin insufficiency, increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, reduced capacity for energy transport, sulfation and detoxification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several of the biomarker groups were significantly associated with variations in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These nutritional and metabolic differences are generally in agreement with other published results and are likely amenable to nutritional supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Research investigating treatment and its relationship to the co-morbidities and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> is warranted </plain></SENT>
