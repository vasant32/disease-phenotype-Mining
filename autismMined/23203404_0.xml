<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives were to determine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> prevalence in the year 2006 in New Jersey and to identify changes in the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> or in the characteristics of the children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo>, between 2002 and 2006 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Point prevalence estimates by sex, ethnicity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> subtype, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> diagnosis were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 2006, a total of 533 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> were identified, consistent with prevalence of 17.4 per 1000 (95% confidence interval = 15.9-18.9), indicating a significant increase in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> prevalence (p &lt; 0.001), between 2002 (10.6 per 1000) and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rise in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> was broad, affecting major demographic groups and subtypes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to specify the influence of better awareness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> prevalence estimates and to identify possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More resources are necessary to address the needs of individuals affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
