<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a limb culture system, we have analyzed the role of FGF signaling and its interaction with the Ihh/Pthlh and BMP pathways in regulating chondrocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous suggestions, we demonstrate that FGF signaling accelerates both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the pace of hypertrophic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We furthermore found that FGF and BMP signaling act in an antagonistic relationship regulating chondrocyte proliferation, Ihh expression, and the process of hypertrophic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, BMP signaling rescues the reduced domains of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes in a mouse model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose a model in which the balance of BMP and FGF signaling adjusts the pace of the differentiation process to the proliferation rate </plain></SENT>
