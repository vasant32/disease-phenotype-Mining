<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hsp90 is a specialized molecular chaperone involved in stabilizing a select set of proteins termed clients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we delineate the relationship of Hsp90 and co-chaperone Cdc37 with FGFR3 and the FGFR family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 strongly associates with these chaperone complexes and depends on them for stability and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of Hsp90 function using the geldanamycin analog 17-AAG induces the ubiquitination and degradation of FGFR3 and reduces the signaling capacity of FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other FGFRs weakly interact with these chaperones and are differentially influenced by Hsp90 inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Hsp90-related ubiquitin ligase CHIP is able to interact and destabilize FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results establish FGFR3 as a strong Hsp90 client and suggest that modulating Hsp90 chaperone complexes may beneficially influence the stability and function of FGFR3 in disease </plain></SENT>
