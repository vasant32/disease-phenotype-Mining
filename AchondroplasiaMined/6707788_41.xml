<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most were initially thought to have died from sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, historical and pathologic findings suggest that many of these infants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> compression of the lower brainstem or cervical spinal cord </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Appropriate intervention, given these previously unrecognized risks, may include cervical restraint, polysomnographic evaluation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> monitoring </plain></SENT>
