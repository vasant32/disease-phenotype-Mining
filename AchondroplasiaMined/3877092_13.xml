<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, lateral cephalograms of 25 adult males and 26 adult females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were converted to a two-dimensional coordinate model of craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and analyzed using 66 linear, angular, and area variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lateral cephalograms of 951 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two sample t-tests were used to compare achondroplastic cephalograms with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cephalograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate statistical analysis included Hotelling's T2 and discriminant function analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Selected variables were graphed as profile patterns in which mean values were expressed as standard deviation units (Z scores) relative to the norm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, Calcomp plots were used for visual inspection and for comparison of the average cephalometric tracings of male and female achondroplastic subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male and female subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> included enlarged calvaria, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>, large frontal sinuses, occipital prominence, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anterior cranial base length, strikingly shortened posterior cranial base length, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cranial base angle, a <z:mp ids='MP_0004471'>short nasal bone</z:mp> that was deformed and depressed, short upper facial height, recessed maxilla, posterior tilt of the nasal floor, and a prognathic mandible that was anteriorly displaced but of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gonial angle and a high coronoid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anterior cranial base length in achondroplastic subjects was surprising since the cranial base is preformed in cartilage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and shortening would be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since the brain is enlarged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the expanding frontal lobes may possibly influence the growth of the anterior cranial base, since it is known to follow a neural pattern of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cribriform plate length was strikingly reduced, but anterior sphenoidal length was strikingly increased, compensating for the shortened cribriform plate length and suggesting that growth in the length of the anterior cranial base takes place primarily by adaptation at one site--namely, the sphenoethmoidal synchondrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Strikingly short posterior cranial base length was interpreted as resulting from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of bone that is preformed in cartilage with possible early closure of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The exaggerated closure of the cranial base angle in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> may be related to an <z:mp ids='MP_0005238'>increased brain size</z:mp> and possibly earlier than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> closure of the intersphenoidal synchondrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
