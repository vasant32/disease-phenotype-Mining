<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed 28 tibial lengthenings in 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The minimal diameter of the lengthened zone was measured on radiographs, when the sliding mechanism of the lengthening device was released, and the callus diameter ratio in two planes (CDR; diameter of the callus/diameter of the tibia at the level of the osteotomy end) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CDR correlated negatively with the distracted length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Late fracture or late angular deformity occurred in 6 of the 28 lengthenings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the CDR was 85% or more in both planes, these complications did not occur, but when the CDR was 80% or less in either plane, they occurred in 6 of 20 bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Careful attention should therefore be given not only to the continuity of the callus but also to its diameter </plain></SENT>
