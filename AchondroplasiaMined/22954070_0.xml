<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Understanding the pathogenesis of the chiari-like malformation in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) is incomplete, and current hypotheses do not fully explain the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> (SM) in the spinal cords of affected dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates an unconventional pathogenetic theory for the development of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure waves in the subarachnoid space in CKCS with SM, by analogy with human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> the shortening of the skull base can lead to a narrowing of the jugular foramina (JF) between the cranial base synchondroses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This in turn has been reported to cause a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the major venous outflow tracts of the skull and consequently to an increase in the intracranial pressure (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amongst brachycephalic dog breeds the CKCS has been identified as having an extremely short and wide braincase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A stenosis of the JF and a consequential vascular compromise in this opening could contribute to venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, raising ICP and causing CSF jets in the spinal subarachnoid space of the CKCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, JF volumes in CKCSs with and without SM were compared to assess a possible role of this pathologic mechanism in the development of SM in this breed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Computed tomography (CT) scans of 40 CKCSs &gt; 4 years of age were used to create three-dimensional (3D) models of the skull and the JF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weight matched groups (7-10 kg) of 20 CKCSs with SM and 20 CKCSs without SM were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CKCSs without SM presented significantly larger JF -volumes (median left JF: 0.0633 cm3; median right JF: 0.0703 cm3; p &lt; 0.0001) when compared with CKCSs with SM (median left JF: 0.0382 cm3; median right JF: 0.0434 cm3; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the left and right JF within each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bland-Altman analysis revealed excellent reproducibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volume measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A stenosis of the JF and consecutive venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> may explain the aetiology of CSF pressure waves in the subarachnoid space, independent of cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, as an additional pathogenetic factor for the development of SM in this breed </plain></SENT>
