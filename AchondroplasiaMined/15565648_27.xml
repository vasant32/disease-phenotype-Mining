<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The efficacious analysis of fetal loci involving point mutations from circulatory fetal DNA in maternal plasma is hindered by the preponderance of maternal DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that the size difference between fetal and maternal DNA species can be used for the selective enrichment of circulatory fetal DNA in maternal plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now tested this approach for the detection of a fetal point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Circulatory DNA was extracted from maternal plasma and size-fractionated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fraction with a size less than 300 bp was examined by a touchdown PCR assay specific for the FGFR3 gene, and the mutation was identified by SfcI restriction analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Our analysis indicated that although the fetal mutation was discernible in the analysis of total plasma DNA, the result using size-fractionated DNA was much more evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The enrichment of circulatory fetal DNA in maternal plasma by size-fractionation facilitates the detection of subtle feto-maternal genetic differences, such as those involving point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach can easily be extended for the non-invasive prenatal determination of other fetal loci </plain></SENT>
