<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, includes short cranial base and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>; both abnormalities increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate sleep and respiratory function of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and to differentiate central from obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also wanted to correlate apneic events with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005468'>foramen magnum stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Sixteen children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (mean age, 4.7 years) were studied by noctumal polysomnography and brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison of sleep and respiratory findings was made between the study group and 25 children with adenotonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study revealed no significant difference between groups with respect to sleep architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found no relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> type and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005468'>foramen magnum stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve children (75%) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> during sleep, with symptoms of continuous snoring and periods of brief obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean apneahypopnea index (per hour of sleep) did not differ significantly between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the breathing rate during sleep was increased in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the most important breathing disorder during sleep in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that polysomnography with detailed scoring of breathing abnormalities is a useful tool in evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
