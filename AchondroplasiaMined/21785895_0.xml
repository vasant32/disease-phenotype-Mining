<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Use of the Ilizarov technique for limb lengthening in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is controversial, with a high risk of complications balancing cosmetic gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several articles have described the complications of this procedure and satisfaction of patients after surgery, it remains unclear whether lengthening improves the quality of life (QOL) of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether bilateral lower limb lengthenings with deformity correction in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> would improve QOL and investigated the correlation between complication rate and QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients (average age, 12.7 years) diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who underwent bilateral lower limb lengthenings between 2002 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> for whom limb lengthening was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups were assessed using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb, SF-36, and Rosenberg self-esteem scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minimum followup was 4.5 years (range, 4.5-6.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the lengthening group, the average gain in length was 10.21 ± 2.39 cm for the femur and 9.13 ± 2.12 cm for the tibia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 123 complications occurred in these 88 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The surgical group had higher Rosenberg self-esteem scores than the nonsurgical group although there were no differences in the AAOS and the SF-36 scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The self-esteem scores decreased with the increase in the number of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that despite frequent complications, bilateral lower limb lengthening increases patients' QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We believe lengthening is a reasonable option in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study </plain></SENT>
