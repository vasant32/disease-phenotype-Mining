<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and achondroplastic mouse chondrocytes were cultured in monolayer primary culture, their differentiation was verified by immunofluorescence and their growth was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that achondroplastic cells exhibited a higher proliferative activity than control cells of the same age, confirmed also by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, basic fibroblast growth factor treatment was found to induce a strong increase in growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse chondrocytes, while it did not stimulate statistically significant proliferation of achondroplastic mouse cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suppose that this different growth rate could play a role in achondroplastic phenotype development </plain></SENT>
