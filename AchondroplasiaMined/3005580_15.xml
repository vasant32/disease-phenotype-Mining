<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No gross rearrangements were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The segregation of COL2A1 was examined in three affected kindreds using restriction site and length variants as genetic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two kindreds discordant segregation between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and COL2A1 loci was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paternity/maternity was confirmed using a 'minisatellite' core sequence probe which reveals cross hybridising polymorphic loci </plain></SENT>
