<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using data from seven malformation monitoring systems around the world, the feasibility of monitoring fresh dominant mutations using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a total of over 9.5 million births, 1500 infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> were identified (16 per 100,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of efforts to get exact diagnoses, an average of 21% were unspecified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of rates of specific diagnoses in different programmes suggested that classification differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By analysing maternal age distribution, estimates were made of the proportion of fresh mutations in different subgroups: conditions regarded as dominant (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo>) were estimated to consist of 58% fresh mutations--some of the remaining cases were inherited, others were probably misclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among conditions regarded as recessive, only 5% were estimated to be truly dominant mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the total group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, 21% were estimated to be fresh dominant mutations and if <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> were excluded, the figure was 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By power analyses it was shown that equal monitoring power may be obtained by a programme covering about 45,000 births per year with intensive diagnosis of each individual case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> and a programme some three times greater where no specific diagnoses are obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increasing trend in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> was seen but probably explained by changing ascertainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An impact of antenatal diagnosis resulting in a decrease in occurrence was also apparent in some programmes </plain></SENT>
