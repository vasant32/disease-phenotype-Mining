<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males and females with EDS were hypermobile but only the females with OI and the female relatives of those with severe or lethal OI showed excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> exhibited a grosser type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo> than other subjects while those with GOA represented a relatively stiff group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No evidence was found to support the view that hypermobility is associated with particular length variants at the Type II collagen structural gene locus (COL2A1) </plain></SENT>
