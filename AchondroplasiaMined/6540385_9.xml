<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with neurologic signs or symptoms had abnormal SEPs, with good correlation between SEP results and the level of the lesion determined clinically and radiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEPs were abnormal in 44% of neurologically intact achondroplasts, several of whom had CTs confirming significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005468'>foramen magnum stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SEPs are an important noninvasive means of evaluating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and are particularly valuable in children to document neurologic compromise before significant and perhaps irreversible clinical impairment develops </plain></SENT>
