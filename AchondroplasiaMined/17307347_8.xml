<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies in chondrocytes and cartilage biopsies suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007302" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cartilage disease</z:e> is caused by retention of mutant COMP in the endoplasmic reticulum of chondrocytes and by disruption of the collagen network of the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the tendon disease remains unclear in the absence of a cell culture model, with available tendon biopsies leading to conflicting results with respect to the intracellular retention of mutant COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We established a cell culture model using adenoviral gene transfer in tendon fibroblast cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of expression of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>-associated COMP mutants and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> protein on COMP secretion, matrix composition and cellular viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results show that mutants D475N and D469Delta are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of tendon cells similar to what is known from chondrocytes, whereas mutant H587R is secreted like <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spite of this difference, the collagen I matrix formed in culture appears disturbed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> COMP-mutants induce apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> irrespective of their differing secretion patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pathogenic pathways leading to tendon disease in humans appear to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> between different COMP mutants </plain></SENT>
