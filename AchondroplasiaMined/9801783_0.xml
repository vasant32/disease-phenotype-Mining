<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed nine tibial lengthenings in seven achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The callotasis method was used, and a unilateral type lengthener, either the Dynamic Axial Fixator (Orthofix, Italy; eight legs) or the High Functional Fixator (Matsumoto Co., Japan; one leg), was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distracted length averaged 14.6 (range 10-18) cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The minimum diameter of the callus was measured using a ruler on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The callus diameter ratio (%) was calculated as the callus diameter divided by the original diaphysis diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For periods during axial loading and after removal of the fixator in each patient, a single regression line was drawn on the callus diameter ratio data using the least squares method, and the diameter change rate (%/day) was evaluated by inclination of this line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter change rates during axial loading were negative in six legs, but those after fixator removal were positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> legs, and the latter were significantly greater than the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diameter change rates after fixator removal on the anteroposterior radiographs were negatively correlated with the callus diameter ratio at the time of fixator removal (r = 0.84, P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simple axial loading may not be a sufficient mechanial environment for restoration of the physiological shape, and it is important to be aware that we cannot expect the callus diameter to increase by this means alone </plain></SENT>
