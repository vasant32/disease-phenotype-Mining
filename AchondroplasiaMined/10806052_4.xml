<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a first step in generating a mouse model for COMP mutations, we have cloned the cDNA of mouse COMP and examined its tissue expression pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was isolated from the skeletal tissues of newborn C57BL/6j mice and used as a template for oligo(dT) first-strand cDNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cDNA was used for PCR amplification of COMP using three oligonucleotide primer pairs designed from the published rat COMP cDNA sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nested PCR was used to complete the sequence between the amplified fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The entire cDNA was sequenced and the expression pattern of the corresponding transcripts examined by Northern hybridizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A full-length COMP cDNA was isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis showed that the entire translated region of the mouse COMP gene is 2268 bp and the derived amino acid sequence shows 90% homology to human COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of eight adult mouse non-cartilage tissues tested, COMP expression was detected only in testis </plain></SENT>
