<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several of these same FGFR3 mutations have also been identified somatically in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular pathways exploited by FGFR3 to stimulate abnormal proliferation during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) has been shown previously to regulate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a novel interaction between FGFR3 and Pyk2, mediated by the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR3 and the kinase domain of Pyk2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within the FGFR family, Pyk2 also interacted significantly with FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Pyk2 alone led to its spontaneous activation and tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in activation of Stat5B, indicated by the reporter GFP-Stat5B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These effects were completely dependent upon Tyr(402), the autophosphorylation site of Pyk2, which allows recruitment of Src family members for further activating phosphorylations at other sites on Pyk2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of activated FGFR3, the activation of Pyk2 itself became independent of Tyr(402), indicating that FGFR3 activation circumvents the requirement for c-Src recruitment at Tyr(402) of Pyk2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also examined the role of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in antagonizing Pyk2 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that signaling pathways regulated by FGFR3 may converge with Pyk2-dependent pathways to provide maximal activation of Stat5B </plain></SENT>
