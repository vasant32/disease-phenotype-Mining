<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in the width of the proximal growth plate of the tibia and the caudal vertebrae and in the number of proliferative and hypertrophic cells were recorded in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and achondroplastic (cn/cn) mice during the first 30 neonatal days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice as in achondroplastics, the width of the cartilaginous growth plate decreased progressively with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferative zone of cn/cn mice was similar in structure to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice and showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypertrophied cartilage was less wide and there were fewer hypertrophic cells at the epiphyseal plates than found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data of the present study show that retarded longitudinal bone growth in cn/cn mice is due to reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
