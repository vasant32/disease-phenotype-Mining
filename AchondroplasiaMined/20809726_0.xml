<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors measured pain severity, spatial distribution of pain, functional disability, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e>, physical symptoms other than pain, and healthcare utilization in 181 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also assessed low back and/or lower extremity pain at the initial visit and 1-year follow-up via self-rated patient questionnaires, calculated composite scores from responses via component analyses, and used repeated measures linear regression analyses for score changes (significance, p &lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> severity was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients reported significant progression of pain toward involvement of the lower extremities and significant increases in lower extremity pain severity overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also significant increases in healthcare utilization overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> only, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> and proximal or distal leg pain had higher self-rated pain severity; higher functional disability; and more bowel and bladder dysfunction symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo>, extremity numbness, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0815107" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological distress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> often experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo>, which may progress to lower extremity pain and debilitating consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A more thorough understanding of the progression of spatial pain characteristics and pain severity may aid clinical decision making regarding the optimal timing for intervention </plain></SENT>
