<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> is based primarily on family history, physical examination, and radiographic evaluation, and is sometimes extremely difficult, particularly in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic diagnosis based on DNA sequencing, on the other hand, can be expensive, time-consuming, and intensive because COMP mutations may be scattered throughout the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there is evidence that decreased plasma COMP concentration may serve as a diagnostic marker in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>, particularly in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the serum and/or plasma COMP concentration-based differential diagnosis of a family with affected adult members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean serum and/or plasma COMP concentrations of the three affected family members alive (0.69+/-0.15 and/or 0.81+/-0.08 microg/ml, respectively) were significantly lower than those of an age-compatible control group of 21 adults (1.52+/-0.37 and/or 1.37+/-0.36 microg/ml, respectively; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional fluorescent DNA sequencing-based genetic diagnosis of these patients revealed a heterozygous mutation for the nucleotide change 1532A&gt;G in exon 14 of the COMP gene, resulting in a substitution of amino acid 511 from aspartic acid to glycine in COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, serum and/or plasma COMP concentration may be suggested as an additional diagnostic marker to aid clinical and radiographic findings in suspected cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
