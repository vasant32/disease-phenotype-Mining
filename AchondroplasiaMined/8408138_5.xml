<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A custom-designed femoral prosthesis was implanted with cement and a standard acetabular component was used to treat nineteen severely dysplastic hips in fourteen consecutively managed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Components that had been custom-designed with the use of plain radiography were used because the anatomical reconstructive goals could not be achieved with commercially available implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These goals were to match the offset of the femoral head and the length of the lower limb with those on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side for patients who had unilateral involvement and to provide an average (thirty to forty-millimeter) offset with equal limb lengths for patients who had bilateral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective clinical and radiographic analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002812'>coxa vara</z:hpo> (one hip), congenital dislocation (twelve hips), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (three hips), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (three hips) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of the reconstruction was forty-nine years (range, twenty-two to seventy-three years), and the mean duration of follow-up was fifty-seven months (range, twenty-seven to 108 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five hips, bone-grafting of the acetabulum was needed to obtain superolateral coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical result was excellent in eighteen hips and good in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No revisions have been performed to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two femoral components were possibly loose radiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One was associated with a definite loosening of the acetabular cup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, one other cup was possibly loose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a 100 per cent rate of survival if only a revision procedure was considered as a failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
