<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His height was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but he had short extremities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000926'>platyspondyly</z:hpo>, premature carpal epiphyses on both hands, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003026'>short tubular bones</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003025'>irregular metaphyses</z:hpo> on radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Re-evaluation of the patient at the age of 1 year revealed very short height and premature calcification of the costal cartilages and epiphyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spondylometaepiphyseal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (SMED), short limb-abnormal calcification type was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This condition is a very rare autosomal recessively inherited disorder, and most of the patients die in early childhood due to neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the age of 2 years and 5 months, a CT scan showed narrowing of the cervical spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One month later he died suddenly because of spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion early diagnosis is very important because the recurrence risk is high and patients may die due to early neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of abnormal calcifications, a diagnostic finding of the disease, is at the age of around 1 year in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When abnormal calcifications are not yet present, but radiological changes associated with SMED are present, this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> must be considered </plain></SENT>
