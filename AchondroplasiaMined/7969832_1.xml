<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients presented with clinically significant compression at multiple levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these patients, there were focal areas of complete myelographic block, typically at the cervicothoracic or thoracolumbar junction, as well as diffuse narrowing of the entire spinal subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some, there were further complications of basilar impression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total craniospinal decompression was completed in either one or two stages </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with proper preparation and technique, we found that patients can tolerate even such an extensive decompressive procedure and benefit from surgery without suffering postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0005881'>spinal instability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
