<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> have an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication for operative decompression can not be made by MRI alone, because signal alteration and osseous compression of the cervico-medullary region without functional relevance are frequent in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report on a male new-born with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who displayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoeas</z:hpo> from the first day of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two times, mask ventilation had to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of other diseases potentially causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoeas</z:hpo>, an MRI of the skull and cervical spine revealed cervico-medullary compression due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005468'>foramen magnum stenosis</z:hpo>, but no signal alterations of brain stem and cervical mark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recording of somato-sensory evoked potentials (SSEP) of the median nerve showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> potentials at Erb's point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, cortical potentials were distinctly abnormal during left-sided stimulation and could not be recorded during right-sided stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, operative decompression of the craniocervical region was performed which led immediately to complete remission of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, MRI revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> width of the foramen magnum and SSEP were markedly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In newborns with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e>, SSEP can confirm the functional relevance of osseous compression of the cervico-medullary region, and facilitate the decision for operative decompression </plain></SENT>
