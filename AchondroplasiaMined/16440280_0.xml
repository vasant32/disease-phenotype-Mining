Putative examples of sports have been used as evidence of rapid macroevolution since Darwin first discussed the Ancon sheep mutation in 1859 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ancon sheep had very <z:hpo ids='HP_0006385'>short legs</z:hpo> that were considered an advantage for shepherds because the sheep were less likely to escape over fences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many textbooks and articles implied that the breed was an example of how a major new trait could evolve in a single generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Ancon sheep example has been used both to prove gradual Darwinism and also to argue for rapid evolution as opposed to gradualism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It now is recognized that Ancon sheep resulted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e>, and that they usually suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The so-called new breed had so many major health problems that the condition caused the breed's extinction decades ago, yet was mentioned in textbooks as evidence for evolutionary jumps as recently as 2005 </plain></SENT>
