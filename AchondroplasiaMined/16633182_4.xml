<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several investigators have estimated the intracranial volume (ICV) in the past which indirectly reflects the brain volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies have been made on the dry skulls using linear dimensions, packing methods or occasionally radiological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is also reported that the etiology of cerebellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> is closely related to the size of the foramen magnum (FM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study the ICVs have been estimated in 28 dry skulls using filling water method and the surface area of FMs were measured planimetry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated mean ICV was 1,311 +/- 133 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surface area of FM was 760 +/- 144 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antero-posterior and lateral direct roentgenograms of the skulls were also taken and the width, height and length (WHL) of the skull were measured by means of the cephalometry on radiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the ICV, WHL and surface area of FM were analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ICV, WHL and surface area of FM was correlated well (r = 0.271, P &lt; 0.005; r = 0.265, P &lt; 0.005, respectively) and a regression formula was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that skulls with larger ICV and WHL have larger FM surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also suggested a regression formula that could be used to predict the surface area of FM regarding to the ICV and WHL values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the next step, we took roentgenograms of skulls and obtain ICV measuring the width, length and height of skulls by means of cephalometry and investigate the relation between the findings of cephalometry and surface area of FM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cephalometry could apply on living subjects and, thereby, our findings could provide some data to evaluate the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold Chiari malformation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> for living subjects </plain></SENT>
