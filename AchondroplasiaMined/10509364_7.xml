<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the effects of recombinant hGH (r-hGH) therapy for up to 6 y on stature and body proportions of 35 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consecutive height (Ht) measurements were plotted on disease-specific <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> growth curves, but age and sex SD scores (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) of Ht, sitting Ht, subischial leg length, and Ht velocity were made with respect to Tanner <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>r-hGH was administered by daily subcutaneous injections at a median (range) dose of 30 (15.8-40) U/m2 per week [0.06 (0.04-0.08) mg.kg(-1).24 h(-1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated for 3 (1-6) y from age 2.25 (1.2-9.3) y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, Ht <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> was -4.6 (-6.5 to -3.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment caused a significant increase in Ht <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> year to year until y 4 (ANOVA F = 46.94; p &lt; 0.01) that was subsequently sustained with no significant further change (y 5 and 6 versus y 4, p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the response to r-hGH was also expressed as a change in Ht velocity, there was a significant increase in the first year of therapy that was maintained over subsequent treatment years (ANOVA = 4.28, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age was the most important variable accounting for the first-year response in Ht <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (r2 = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001), and dose of r-hGH did not influence this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increments in sitting Ht <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> were greater than subischial leg length <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (F = 26.25, p &lt; 0.001; F = 9.04, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>r-hGH treatment improved the Ht position of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> children relative to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> peers without obvious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A young age at initiation of therapy prevented the characteristic Ht deficit from accumulating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The greater increase in spinal Ht accentuated the existing disproportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The addition of later surgical leg lengthening could offer the possibility of proportionate adult stature just within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
