<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> we recorded somatosensory evoked potentials after median nerve (MN) and posterior tibial nerve (PTN) stimulation in 77 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> aged 0.3-17.8 years (mean 2.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the conventional technique of recording the cortical components and the central conduction time (CCT) we employed non-cephalic and mastoid reference electrodes to record the subcortical waveforms N13b and P13 (MN-SEP) as well as P30 (PTN-SEP), respectively, which are generated near the cranio-cervical junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were related to the MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients had abnormal MRI findings including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> (n=28) and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelomalacia</z:e> (n=24) at or below the cranio-cervical junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the MN-SEPs was 0.74 including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal upper cervical cord MRI findings (specificity 0.98), and the sensitivity was 0.79 (specificity 0.92) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002341'>cervical cord compression</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the PTN-SEPs was 0.52 (specificity 0.93) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormal MRI findings and 0.59 (specificity 0.92) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002341'>cervical cord compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subcortical SEPs N13b and P13 as well as P30 were more sensitive than the conventional recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MN-SEPs, notably the subcortical tracings, are useful for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PTN-SEPs are less sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the tibial nerve SEPs might contribute additional information from the lumbar or thoracic spinal cord, which was, however, not tested in this study </plain></SENT>
