<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations induce misfolding of intracellular COMP, resulting in retention of the protein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) of chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This accumulation of COMP in the rER creates the phenotypic enlarged rER cisternae in the cells, which is believed to compromise chondrocyte function and eventually cause cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the molecular mechanisms involved with the disease, we sought to develop an in vitro model that recapitulates the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human chondrocytes were transfected with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> (wt-) COMP or with mutant COMP (D469del; mt-) recombinant adenoviruses and grown in a nonattachment redifferentiating culture system that provides an environment allowing formation of a differentiated chondrocyte nodule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visualization of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells expressing COMP suggested the hallmarks of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutant COMP expressed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells was retained in enlarged rER cisternae, which also retained IX collagen (COL9) and matrilin-3 (MATN3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although these proteins were secreted normally into the ECM of the wt-COMP nodules, reduced secretion of these proteins was observed in nodules composed of cells transfected with mt-COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings complement those found in chondrocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patient growth plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This new model system allows for production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocyte pathology in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> costochondral chondrocytes and can be used for future mechanistic and potential gene therapy studies </plain></SENT>
