<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Body mass index (BMI)-for-age references are required for weight management guidance for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, whose body proportions are unlike those of the average stature population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study used weight and height data in a clinical setting to derive smoothed BMI-for-age percentile curves for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and explored the relation of BMI with its components, weight and height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This was a longitudinal observational study of anthropometric measures of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> from birth through 16 y of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis included 1807 BMI data points from 280 children (155 boys, 125 girls) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared with the BMI of peers of average stature, the BMI in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is higher at birth, lacks a steep increase in infancy and a later nadir between 1 and 2 y of age, and remains substantially higher through 16 y of age in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patterns of change in height and weight in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> are unique in that there is no overlap in the height distribution after 6 mo of age and no spike in height velocity during infancy or puberty-the 2 periods of greatest linear growth in individuals of average stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sex- and age-specific BMI curves are available for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (birth to 16 y of age) for health surveillance and future research to determine associations with health outcomes (eg, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and indication for and outcome of surgery) </plain></SENT>
