<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employed proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE, 3 MeV proton beam) to investigate the concentrations of zinc, copper, calcium, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi>, chlorine, <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi>, iron and <z:chebi fb="152" ids="28112">nickel</z:chebi> in washed sperm and seminal plasma from non-smoking groups of 10 older men (65-80 years old) and 10 younger men (22-28 years old) who were concurrently assayed for sperm function and genomicly defective sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The older group showed elevated zinc, copper and calcium in sperm and elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> in seminal plasma compared with the younger men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The older group also showed reduced motility as well as increased sperm DNA fragmentation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> mutations, DNA strand breaks and chromosomal aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sperm calcium and copper were positively associated with sperm DNA fragmentation (P &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> was positively associated with sperm DNA fragmentation and chromosomal aberrations (P &lt; 0.04), and negatively associated with sperm motility (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sperm calcium was negatively associated with sperm motility, independent of male age (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We identified major differences in elemental concentrations between sperm and seminal plasma and that higher sperm copper, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26833">sulfur</z:chebi> and calcium are quantitatively associated with poorer semen quality and increased frequencies of genomic sperm defects </plain></SENT>
