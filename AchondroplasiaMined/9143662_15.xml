<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Quantitative histomorphometric features of the bone growth plate in the human rib have been investigated in infants, ranging in age from 3-36 weeks (mean 18.6 weeks) to provide data currently not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Measurements were taken in each histological zone of the growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from 20 cases were pooled and parameters describing the characteristic features of trabecular bone calculated using morphometric formulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measurements were made from the resting zone of the cartilage to the secondary spongiosa, 3.78 mm from the starting point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cartilage volume fraction decreased from 78% in the resting zone to a bone volume fraction of between 20% and 30% in the secondary cancellous bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cartilage matrix surface increased rapidly in the cartilage and bone mineral surface declined in correspondence with the development of primary bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distance between chondrocyte lacunae was observed to decrease throughout the cartilage to a transverse septa thickness of 18 microns in the hypertrophic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rapid increase in trabecular thickness to 128 microns was observed in the primary spongiosa, the secondary spongiosa ranging between 137 microns and 168 microns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spacing, chondrocyte profile transverse diameter, increased to 30 microns in the hypertrophic zone, following which an increase in trabecular separation to 347 microns was observed in the primary spongiosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of transverse intervals between individual chondrocyte lacunae was observed to increase in the cartilage to a maximum of 21.3 cartilaginous or mineralised septa per mm of growth plate length in the hypertrophic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trabeculae in the metaphysis then decreased in number to approximately 1.5 trabeculae per mm in the secondary spongiosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data thus provide new insight into the development of trabecular structure during growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values for the comparison of tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> and growth disorders </plain></SENT>
