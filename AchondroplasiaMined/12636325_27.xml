<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of the prenatal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> antenatally detected anomalies are coded in our ultrasound database, which is linked with a genetics database that includes outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A final diagnosis is sought on the basis of radiographic studies, molecular testing, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our ultrasound and genetics databases were queried for "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>." <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were reviewed specifically for the degree of bone shortening and other distinguishing characteristics on antenatal sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-seven cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> were antenatally diagnosed over an 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up was available in 31 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 22.7 weeks (range, 14-32.3 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases were diagnosed before 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A final diagnosis was obtained in 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The antenatal diagnosis was correct in 20 (65%) of 31 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were 2 false-positive diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific final diagnoses included thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (8), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> (6), Roberts syndrome (2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ellis-van Creveld syndrome</z:e> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100255'>metaphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005684'>distal arthrogryposis</z:hpo> (1), caudal regression (1), and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> storage disorder (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The condition was correctly thought to be lethal in 16 of the fetuses on the basis of early severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003026'>long bone shortening</z:hpo> (13), femur length-abdominal circumference ratio of less than 0.16 (12), hypoplastic thorax (10), marked bowing or fractures (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000773'>short ribs</z:hpo> (4), caudal regression (1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ability to predict <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were no false-positive findings with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accurate antenatal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> is problematic; in this series, only 20 of 31 cases were correctly diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the antenatal prediction of <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was highly accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The most common predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005716'>lethal skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> included early and severe shortening of the long bones, femur length-abdominal circumference ratio of less than 0.16, hypoplastic thorax, and certain distinguishing characteristics </plain></SENT>
