<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only a small number of studies have documented the clinical phenotype and genetic basis in Chinese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We investigated a four-generation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> pedigree of Chinese Han origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients and two unaffected individuals were recruited for clinical evaluation and molecular genetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was adopted to amplify the 8-19 exons of COMP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the products were sequenced bi-directionally for screening mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluation revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patients in this pedigree had a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> (-10SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A heterozygous TGTCCCTGG insertion in exon 13, between nucleotide 1352T and 1353G, were identified in the patients except the unaffected individuals, which resulted in a three-amino-acid insertion (451V_452P ins VPG) in the sixth calmodulin-like repeat of the COMP protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1352_1353ins TGTCCCTGG is a novel mutation responsible for severe familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
