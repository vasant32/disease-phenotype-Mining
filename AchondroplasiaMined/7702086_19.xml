<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo> resulting from a defect in the maturation of the chondrocytes in the growth plate of the cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies mapped the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> gene on chromosome region 4p16.3 and identified a common mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an analysis of 19 achondroplasia families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds we confirmed the presence of the G380R mutation in 21 of 23 achondroplasia chromosomes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the G380R mutation was not found in any of the 8 hypochondroplasia chromosomes studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, linkage studies in a 3-generation family with hypochondroplasia show discordant segregation with markers in the 4p16.3 region suggesting that at least some cases of hypochondroplasia are caused by mutations in a gene other than FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
