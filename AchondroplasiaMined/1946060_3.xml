<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results in 11 patients, six with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leg length discrepancies</z:e> and five with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, who underwent lengthening procedures using the Ilizarov method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lengthening was accomplished in 15 of the 16 procedures (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average increase in femur length was 10 cm (32%), in tibial length 7.5 cm (30%), in humerus length 11 cm (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common were pin tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo> (2), transient nerve injury (4), premature consolidation (5), and three fractures of the regenerated bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complication rate was as high as in other methods, but with the Ilizarov apparatus longer segments of bone were lengthened and more complex deformities were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of complications were lessened as experience was gained </plain></SENT>
