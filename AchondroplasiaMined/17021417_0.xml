<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lateral radiographs and the sagittal and axial MRI study of the cervical spine from C3 to C7 level were carried out in 18 asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 90 levels were evaluated on the lateral radiographs and on the mid sagittal T2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On statistic analysis, the highest correlation coefficient for the Torg ratio compared with the ESCD was 0.74 at C6 level and the least was 0.45 at the C5 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The highest correlation coefficient between the Torg ratio and the DSR was 0.79 at C3 level and the least was 0.42 at the C5 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest coefficient of determination for the ESCD was 54% at C6 which translates into a poor correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest coefficient of determination for the DSR was 62 at C3 level, indicating a variable correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results clearly show that the Torg ratio is of limited value in the assessment of the true sagittal spinal canal diameter in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and its reliability as an indicator of severe cervical canal stenosis is questionable </plain></SENT>
