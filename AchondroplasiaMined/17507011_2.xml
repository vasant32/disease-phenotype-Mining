<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One control and eight mutant chondrocytic lines expressing different FGFR3 heterozygous mutations were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 signaling pathways were modified in the mutant lines as revealed by the constitutive activation of the STAT pathway and an increased level of P21(WAF1/CIP1) protein </plain></SENT>
