<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We applied a comprehensive set of clinical and radiological criteria for the diagnosis of hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>) in 160 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> 58 of whom were diagnosed to have <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the genotypic and phenotypic variations in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, we conducted a study with these 58 patients and tested them for mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> homeobox (SHOX) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized the phenotypes by clinical and radiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, 19 were included in Group I (FGFR3 mutations-mutations of definite significance), and 39 were in Group II (6 SHOX mutations and 33 negative for disease-causing FGFR3 mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings were similar in two groups regardless of the presence or absence of mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than 95% of the patients had mesomelic proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Group I, the radiological findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003027'>mesomelia</z:hpo> of upper and lower limbs and, L1/L4 ratio in anterior-posterior and lateral view were more typical than in Group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study proposes comprehensive clinico-radiological criteria for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, which would help in detecting the true incidence of this underdiagnosed condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of SHOX mutations suggest genotypic-phenotypic overlap between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, though further investigation is needed to effectively elucidate the importance of these mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the 56.9% of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> patients with negative mutations for FGFR3 suggests that there are other undiscovered gene mutations associated with this phenotypic entity </plain></SENT>
