<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review our eight-year <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> experience with achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 15 achondroplastic patients who underwent 53 surgical procedures of orthopedic surgery between 1987 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anesthetic</z:chebi> technique, drugs, number of incidents, and complications in the intraoperative and postoperative period were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Adequate premedication before the transfer to the operating room was very useful to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and increase cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Inhalation induction was well tolerated and allowed easy peripheral venous cannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient presented difficulties during intubation (on two occasions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other patients, we found small difficulties only during ventilation with a face mask, which was easily corrected by modifying the position of the patient and/or inserting an oropharyngeal airway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No adverse effect was identified for any particular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic drug</z:chebi> or technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the characteristic deformities of achondroplastic patients can impede the management of anesthesia, in our study we found no special difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Airway complications did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, no specific optimal <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> regimen can be recommended </plain></SENT>
