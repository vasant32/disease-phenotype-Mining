<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report the first attempts at preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) and IVF and their accompanying difficulties for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> test was developed using fluorescent single cell PCR on lymphoblasts from patients and controls and from blastomeres from surplus IVF embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A specific digestion control based on the use of two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51217">fluorochromes</z:chebi> was elaborated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval were carried out using conventional protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We performed 88 single cell tests for which amplification was obtained in 86 (97.7%) single lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele drop out (ADO) was observed in two out of 53 (3.7%) heterozygous lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If we combine the results from the blastomere testing from surplus embryos with those from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> cycles and re-analysis after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>, we obtained a PCR signal in 84% of cases of which 91% were correctly diagnosed at the G380 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of six cycles were performed resulting in three embryo transfers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed difficulties in ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval with affected female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No pregnancy was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> test for ACH is now available at our centre but our initial practice raises questions on the feasibility of such a test, specially with affected female patients </plain></SENT>
