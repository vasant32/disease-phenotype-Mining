<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the past year, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> locus has been mapped to 4p 16.3 (refs 5-7) and mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene have been identified in patients with the disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 95% of 242 cases reported so far are accounted for by a single Gly380Arg mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>McKusick et al. proposed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and hypochondroplasia are allelic based on the similarities in phenotype between the two disorders and the identification of a severely dwarfed individual whose father had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and whose mother had hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is also genetic linkage evidence that hypochondroplasia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> map to the same locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore began a systematic screening of FGFR3 to detect mutations in patients with hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We now report a single FGFR3 mutation found in 8 out of 14 unrelated patients with hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mutation causes a C to A transversion at nucleotide 1620, resulting in an Asn540Lys substitution in the proximal tyrosine kinase domain </plain></SENT>
