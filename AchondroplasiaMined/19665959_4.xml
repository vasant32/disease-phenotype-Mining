<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, correction can be difficult in cases of multiple deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1994, Charles Taylor developed a new computer-assisted hexapodal external fixator system to treat these pathologies, the Taylor Spatial Frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to evaluate the results obtained with this technique in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002814'>lower-limb deformities</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients were included in this prospective study, with a mean age of 11.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiologies were distributed into six groups: congenital pathologies in 17 cases, fractures in five cases, post-traumatic pathologies in two cases, postinfectious sequelae in three cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in three cases, and other causes in the last six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 67 deformities in the three spatial planes were found in the entire group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedure consisted of lengthening, correcting the axis, or both simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were managed with the same protocol: placement of an external fixator, AP and lateral X-rays, and planning of the correction using dedicated software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group of 36 patients, the fixator was worn for a mean 183 days; when lengthening was performed, a mean 4.3cm was gained with a healing index of 38.2 days/cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 67 initial deformities, 91% were corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered complications were a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282002" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superficial infection</z:e> in 22.2% of the cases; one deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was also noted as well as three bone regenerate fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Use of this computer-assisted fixation system seems effective in treating complex deformities of the limbs in children, and allows treating several deformities simultaneously </plain></SENT>
