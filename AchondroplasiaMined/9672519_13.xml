<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor gene (FGFR3) have been described in some cases of hypochondroplasia (Hch) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We screened 65 children with Hch diagnosed by clinical and radiologic criteria for 2 previously described mutations, C1620A and C1620C in FGFR3; 28 (43%) of 65 patients were heterozygous for the C1620A transversion resulting in lysine to asparagine substitution at codon 540 in the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The height, sitting height, and subischial leg length of these children and of 18 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were analyzed at presentation, and SD scores were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For comparison of growth data the patients were divided into three groups: group 1, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> defined by radiology and the presence of the G1138A mutation in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3; group 2, Hch with C1620A mutation; and group 3, Hch with no mutation identified so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Height, sitting height, and subischial leg length SD scores were analyzed as group mean data by analysis of variance with the Student Neuman-Keuls test after testing for multiple contrasts were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three groups were significantly compromised in height, although the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were much shorter with significant reduction in subischial leg length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same pattern was evident in group 2, with additional shortening of the back, the third group was proportionately short </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with the common C1620A mutation met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the criteria for the diagnosis of Hch with a severe phenotype that resembled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> in early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a substantial number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003508'>proportionate short stature</z:hpo> presented at an older age with the same radiologic characteristics and failure of the puberty growth spurt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genetic basis of this milder phenotype not yet known </plain></SENT>
