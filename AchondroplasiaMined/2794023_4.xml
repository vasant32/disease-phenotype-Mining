<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Average increase in length was 15.4 cm (37.7%) per limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone formation was excellent, and there were no neurovascular complications or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numerous problems were encountered during treatment, but there were only two residual complications in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Soft tissue tension and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> precluded further lengthening in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five percent lengthening may be the maximum that can be safely achieved for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and though it may produce cosmetic and psychological benefits, the functional benefits may not justify the expense, morbidity, and risk of the procedure </plain></SENT>
