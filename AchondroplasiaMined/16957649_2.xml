<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pedicle morphometry in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> has not been quantitatively described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed 302 thoracic and lumbar pedicles in 11 patients using computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transverse endosteal diameter, screw path length, transverse angle, sagittal diameter, and sagittal angle were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed for safe screw length, size, and trajectory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with that on healthy people of different races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the maximum endosteal diameter was at L5 and the minimum was at T5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Screw path length was longest at L2 and shortest at T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most dimensions were smaller compared with those of healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Abnormal anteromedial transverse angulations were observed between T11 to L2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The maximum transverse angulations were at T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sagittal diameter was largest at T12 and smallest at T5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The maximum sagittal angle was seen at T2, and at L5 it was caudal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels except L5, the transverse diameter is the limiting factor for screw size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six-millimeter screws can be used at L5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Screws that are 35 mm or less are safe to use between T7 to L5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There are surgically important differences in the different angles and diameters of thoracic and lumbar pedicles of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and those of healthy people </plain></SENT>
