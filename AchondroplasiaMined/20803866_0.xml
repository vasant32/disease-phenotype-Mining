<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the need for home mechanical ventilation at night, the patient had a tracheostomy in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the first surgical procedure, the cuffed tracheostomy tube was left in place during prone positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Difficulties encountered with ventilation through the cuffed tracheostomy tube in the prone position necessitated aborting the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During three subsequent surgeries, the tracheostomy tube was removed and an armored endotracheal tube was placed through the tracheostomy stoma prior to prone positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No further difficulties with ventilation were noted with the subsequent cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are currently no guidelines in the medical literature regarding perioperative management of patients with a tracheostomy requiring prone positioning for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The management of such patients is reviewed and possible problems with tracheostomy positioning during prone positioning are explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given such issues, we would suggest removal of the tracheostomy tube and placement of an armored endotracheal tube through the stoma during surgical procedures in the prone position </plain></SENT>
