<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), several gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR3, and constitutive activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK1) in chondrocytes have been shown to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> in mice by activation of the MAPK signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the previously reported inhibitory role of Spred in the FGFR3/MAPK pathway, we generated mice with a trapped Spred-2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we show that lack of functional Spred-2 protein in mice caused a dwarf phenotype, similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spred-2(-/-) mice showed reduced growth and body weight, they had a shorter tibia length, and showed narrower growth plates as compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected promoter activity and protein expression of Spred-2 in chondrocytes, suggesting an important function of Spred-2 in chondrocytes and bone development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of chondrocytes with different FGF concentrations showed earlier and augmented ERK phosphorylation in Spred-2(-/-) chondrocytes in comparison to Spred-2(+/+) chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest a model in which loss of Spred-2 inhibits bone growth by inhibiting chondrocyte differentiation through up-regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
