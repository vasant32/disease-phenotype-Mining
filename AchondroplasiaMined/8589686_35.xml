<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis provisionally placed hypochondroplasia in the chromosome 4p 16.3 region, a location to which the FGFR3 gene has been mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genotyping of a three-generation family showed no recombinants between the hypochondroplasia phenotype and three highly polymorphic markers flanking the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutation analysis was performed by RT-PCR and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primers covering most of the coding sequence of the FGFR3 gene were used for RT-PCR of FGFR3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and PCR amplification of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A C--&gt;A transversion was detected in nucleotide 1659 predicting an N540K substitution in exon 11 which encodes part of the TK1 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same mutation was found in an individual suspected to be an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>/hypochondroplasia compound phenotype and affected individuals from three other unrelated families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second mutation, a C--&gt;G transversion, also in nucleotide 1659 was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected individuals of another family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter also predicts an N540K substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings establish that a common mutation in the FGFR3 gene underlies hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
