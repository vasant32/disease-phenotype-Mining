<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both disorders can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), an extracellular matrix <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About one-third of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> cases result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32470">aspartic acid residues</z:chebi> within the calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified two expansion mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patient carrying a (GAC)7allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These are among the shortest disease-causing triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first identified in a GAC repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cartilage, both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both cartilage and tendon </plain></SENT>
