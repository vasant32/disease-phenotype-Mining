<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>), the most common form of short-limb <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, and related disorders are caused by constitutively active point mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have provided a large body of evidence for the role of the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a G380R mutation in FGFR3 (FGFR3(<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>)), which results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is associated with a decrease in the expression of PTHrP, which shares the same receptor with PTH, and it is significant that PTHrP rescues these cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fetuses derived from transgenic mice expressing FGFR3(<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) under the control of the type II collagen promoter (AchTG) or from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice were obtained on the 15th day of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The femurs were collected from these specimens and cultured for 4 days with PTH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of PTH treatment were then determined by morphometric and histological analyses, in situ hybridization of type X collagen <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and the TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AchTG femurs showed suppressed growth compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (0.29+/-0.10 mm vs. 0.46+/-0.06 mm, respectively; p&lt;0.05), particularly in cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PTH treatments improved the growth velocity in the femurs of the AchTG (0.50+/-0.06 mm; p&lt;0.01 vs. control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was associated with the inhibition of both differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PTH inhibits differentiation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in chondrocytes and improves bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These effects thus counterbalance the effects of FGFR3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>PTH therefore is a potential therapeutic agent for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
