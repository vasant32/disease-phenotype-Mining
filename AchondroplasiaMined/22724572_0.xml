<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The achondroplastic spinal canal is narrow due to short pedicles and a small interpedicular distance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compression of neural structures passing through this canal is therefore regularly encountered but rarely described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptomatology, radiological evaluation, and treatment of 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who underwent decompression of the thoracic spinal cord are described and outcome is correlated with the size of the spinal canal and the thoracolumbar kyphotic angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Scores from the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, Nurick scale, European <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>Myelopathy</z:hpo> scale, Cooper <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> scale for lower extremities, and Odom criteria before and after surgery were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated to determine the size of the spinal canal, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo>, and presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelomalacia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thoracolumbar kyphotic angle was measured using fluoroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient symptomatology included deterioration of walking pattern, pain, cramps, spasms, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> due to degenerative changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery resulted in a slight improvement on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the ranking scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery at the wrong level occurred in 15% of cases, but no serious complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean thoracolumbar kyphotic angle was 20Â°, and no correlation was established between this angle and outcome after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No postoperative increase in this angle was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation between size of the spinal canal and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompressive surgery of the thoracic spinal cord in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> can be performed safely if anatomical details are taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spondylodesis did not appear essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Special attention should be given to the method of surgery, identification of the level of interest, and follow-up of the thoracolumbar kyphotic angle </plain></SENT>
