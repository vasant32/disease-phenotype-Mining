<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high levels of kinase activity of the FGFR3-mutants cause uncompleted biosynthesis that results in the accumulation of the immature/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-rich, phosphorylated receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and STATs activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that FGFR3 mutants activate Erk1/2 from the ER through an FRS2-independent pathway: instead, a multimeric complex by directly recruiting PLCgamma, Pyk2 and JAK1 is formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Erk1/2 activation from the ER however, is PLCgamma-independent, since preventing the PLCgamma/FGFR3 interaction by the Y754F substitution does not inhibit Erks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Erk1/2 activation is abrogated upon treatment with the Src inhibitor PP2, suggesting a role played by a Src family member in the pathway from the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally we show that the intrinsic kinase activity by mutant receptors is required to allow signaling from the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall these results highlight how activated FGFR3 exhibits signaling activity in the early phase of its biosynthesis and how segregation in a sub-cellular compartment can affect the FGFR3 multi-faceted capacity to recruit specific substrates </plain></SENT>
