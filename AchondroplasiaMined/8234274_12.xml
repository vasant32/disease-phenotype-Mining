<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent findings indicate that tandemly repeated triplet sequences in certain disease-causing human genes may render these genes highly unstable not only in meiosis but also in mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typically, a dominant mutation arises upon expansion in the number of these repeated elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have considered how mitotic instability of this sort might affect both phenotypic expression and allele transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A model based on these considerations leads to the following predictions: (i) Phenotypic severity among individuals who inherit an unstable allele should be highly variable due to stochastic variation in the stage of its earliest mutagenic expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(ii) Strikingly increased severity or decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> in some offspring should arise because of parental germ-line mosaicism for an expanded or mutant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(iii) The magnitude of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>genetic anticipation</z:hpo> should be more strongly correlated with paternal than with maternal age at the time of conception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(iv) Given a child born with a severe phenotype, the recurrence risk for a second severely affected child should be significantly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(v) The severity of phenotype in a child should be positively correlated with that in a parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Available data on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">fragile X syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington disease</z:e>, and myotonic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> are shown to be consistent with the model, and implications for an understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and other dominant disorders are discussed </plain></SENT>
