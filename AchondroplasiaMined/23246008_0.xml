<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Fracture is one of the main complications following external fixator removal used in cases of progressive lower limb lengthening; rates as high as 50% are found in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the factors influencing this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eleven cases of lower limb lengthening were performed in 58 patients (40 femurs and 71 tibias) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at surgery was 10.1years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lengthening was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with an external fixator alone, associated in 39.6% of cases with intramedullary nailing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups according to disease etiology (congenital, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and other) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fractures were classified according to the Simpson classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty fractures were recorded (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixteen fractures were found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e>, four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and none in the group of other etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fracture was more often in the femur (27.5%) than in the tibia (12.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The rate of fracture is influenced by different factors depending on the etiology of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital diseases</z:e>, the fracture rate is higher when there is lengthening of more than 15% of the initial length and a delay between surgery and the beginning of lengthening of less than 7days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the influence of a relative percentage of lengthening is less important than in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, to avoid fractures, lengthening should not be started in children under the age of nine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lengthening should begin at least 7days after the fixator has been placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV </plain></SENT>
