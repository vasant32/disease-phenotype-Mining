<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in human cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic analyses of patient biopsy tissue have shown that, in most cases, mutated COMP is retained in granular or lamellar inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum of chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some mutations that do not interfere with protein trafficking, resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> secretion of the mutated protein, have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations are likely to cause the <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> phenotype, via events that occur after secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify such extracellular mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mutated but secreted COMP variant, p.H587R, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP were recombinantly expressed and purified from cell culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since recent studies have shown that COMP can facilitate collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro, the effect of the p.H587R mutation on this process was determined by analyzing the kinetics of fibrillogenesis in vitro and determining the structure of the collagen fibrils formed by immunogold electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutated p.H587R COMP accelerated fibril formation by type I collagen in vitro to a slightly greater extent than that with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, p.H587R COMP induced aggregation and disorganization of fibril intermediates and end products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mixtures of cartilage collagens or of type XI collagen alone produced similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The addition of p.H587R COMP to preformed fibrils induced aggregation and fusion of the fibrils, whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP had little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The mutant COMP variant p.H587R generally interferes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> collagen organization during fibrillogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This constitutes a novel pathogenetic mechanism of COMP-associated <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
