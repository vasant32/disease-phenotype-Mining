<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report on two pregnancies of a healthy, nonconsanguineous young couple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first pregnancy, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002983'>micromelia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007430'>generalized edema</z:hpo> were noted on ultrasound at 21 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical, radiological, and histological evaluation of the fetus after termination of the pregnancy showed typical findings of achondrogenesis type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second pregnancy, fetal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206620" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hygroma</z:e> was noted at 11 weeks' gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings were observed in the second fetus, suggesting the recurrence of achondrogenesis II within this family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of genomic DNA extracted from amniotic cells of the second fetus revealed heterozygosity for a 1340G &gt; A missense mutation (G316D) in the COL2A1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This mutation was not found in the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although, we could not evaluate the presence of this mutation in the first fetus, we strongly believe that our data are in favor of germline mosaicism as the most likely explanation for the recurrence of type II achondrogenesis in both sibs </plain></SENT>
