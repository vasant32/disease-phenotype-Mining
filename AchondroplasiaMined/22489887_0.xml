<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Bilateral tibial lengthening has become one of the standard treatments for upper segment-lower segment disproportion and to improve quality of life in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the effect of tibial lengthening on the tibial physis and compared tibial growth that occurred at the physis with that in non-operated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of serial radiographs until skeletal maturity in 23 achondroplasia patients who underwent bilateral tibial lengthening before skeletal maturity (lengthening group L) and 12 achondroplasia patients of similar height and age who did not undergo tibial lengthening (control group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean amount of lengthening of tibia in group L was 9.2 cm (lengthening percentage: 60%) and the mean age at the time of lengthening was 8.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 9.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Skeletal maturity (fusion of physis) occurred at 15.2 years in group L and at 16.0 years in group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The actual length of tibia (without distraction) at skeletal maturity was 238 mm in group L and 277 mm in group C (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean growth rates showed a decrease in group L relative to group C from about 2 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physeal closure was most pronounced on the anterolateral proximal tibial physis, with relative preservation of the distal physis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that physeal growth rate can be disturbed after tibial lengthening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and a close watch should be kept for such an occurrence-especially when lengthening of more than 50% is attempted </plain></SENT>
