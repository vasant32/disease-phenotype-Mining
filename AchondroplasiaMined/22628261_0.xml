<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing â‰¥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by "fail" on otoacoustic emissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>58 (51.8%) were children </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal hearing was also found in the some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> congenital (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEDC</z:e>; 75%), diastrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (66%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026707" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Morquio</z:e> (66%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tympanometry was abnormal in at least one ear in 53.3% of children and 38.5% of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormal tympanometry in the absence of functioning tympanostomy tubes was associated with 9.5 greater odds of hearing loss in children and 2.8 greater odds of hearing loss in the total cohort </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss and middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e> are common in both children and adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adults were more likely to fail hearing screening than children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Abnormal tympanometry is associated with hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Hearing screening with appropriate intervention is recommended for these patients </plain></SENT>
