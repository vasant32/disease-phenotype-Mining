<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although distraction osteogenesis is a recently established method of limb lengthening, it is not well known how soft tissues behave during bone lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because skin is tissue that can be easily and directly observed, we analyzed skin extension during limb lengthening to study the condition of soft tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We examined three achondroplastic and two hypochondroplastic patients who underwent bilateral tibial lengthening with unilateral bone lengtheners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze skin extension during leg lengthening, the bilateral skin surface was marked in a latticework pattern, starting 10 cm proximal to the knee joint down to 10 cm distal to the ankle joint, with black ink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal length and the area of lattices, and the circumferential length of legs were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that: (1) the longitudinal extension of the skin during leg lengthening occurs not only in the bone lengthening portion between fixator pins but also around the knee or ankle joints; (2) circumferential length of legs was decreased, and soft tissue volume also does not increase in proportion to the increase in leg length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soft tissue volume started to increase in the central region of the legs after a 30% increase in leg length was obtained, resulting in the 10% increase in the volume at the end point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that soft tissue extension precedes soft tissue neogenesis at least during the initial period of leg lengthening, possibly based on its viscoelastic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After a 30% increase in leg length is obtained, soft tissue neogenesis takes place in the central region of the leg </plain></SENT>
