<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fibula was always longer than the tibia </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distance between the distal tibial and fibular physis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in childhood and became increasingly greater during growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tibia varus increased during growth, and there was a particular increase in distal tibia varus toward the end of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The altered growth characteristics of the bones suggest a formulation of cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002970'>bowlegs</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
