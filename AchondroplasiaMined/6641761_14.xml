<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cases were selected from a group of 21 similar cases to illustrate the various degrees of clinical and roentgenological signs that can be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases had various survival periods after birth but not exceeding several months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The roentgenological signs were less severe than those of type II achondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some cases similar to case no. 3 have roentgenological signs very close to spondylo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002656'>epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> congenita and probably were confused previously with the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The name of hypochondrogenesis was proposed for these cases because the lesions of the growth plate are similar although less marked to those found in type II achondrogenesis: high cellularity with poor matrix development; irregular columnization and vascular penetration; large chondrocytes and even more enlarged lacunae; large sclerotic cartilage canals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical and roentgenological diagnosis of hypochondrogenesis could be difficult especially in the less severe forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delay in vertebral ossification, the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the epiphyseal nuclei and of the tarsal bones might suggest the diagnosis of hypochondrogenesis, rather than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The evolution which seems to be always lethal in a period of several weeks or months would make the diagnosis still more likely and it could be confirmed by histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases of spondylo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002656'>epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> congenita might have at birth, roentgenological signs indistinguishable from those of hypochondrogenesis, as was illustrated by case no. 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
