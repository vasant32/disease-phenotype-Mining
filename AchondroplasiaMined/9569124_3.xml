<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mouse cartilage matrix protein gene (Crtm) was isolated from a cosmid library using a mouse Crtm cDNA fragment as probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Crtm spans 12.2 kb from the start of translation to the polyadenylation signal sequence and comprises eight exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the 1.9 kb 5' flanking region revealed a TATA-like box 72 bp upstream from the initiator Met codon as well as several cis-acting motifs known to bind eukaryotic transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the exon-intron junctions demonstrated that the last intron does not follow the gt/ag rule but belongs to the minor class of pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> introns that contain "at" and "ac" at their 5'and 3' ends, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis was used to map Crtm to the distal part of chromosome 4 between the microsatellite markers D4Mit16 and D4Mit339 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Achodroplasia (cn), a recessive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorder</z:e> in mice, has already been mapped to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17361">CMP</z:chebi> and sequence of Crtm in cn/cn mice failed to reveal any disease-specific mutations, suggesting that mutations in Crtm do not cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
