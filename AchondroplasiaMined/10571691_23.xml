<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From in vitro studies, the skeletal defects observed in these disorders have been attributed to constitutive activation of FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that FGF9 and FGFR3, a high-affinity receptor for this ligand, have similar developmental expression patterns, particularly in areas of active chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Targeted overexpression of FGF9 to cartilage of transgenic mice disturbs postnatal skeletal development and linear bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth plate of these mice exhibits reduced proliferation and terminal differentiation of chondrocytes similar to that observed in the human disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observations provide evidence that targeted, in vivo activation of endogenous FGFR3 inhibits bone growth and demonstrate that signals derived from FGF9-FGFR3 interactions can physiologically block endochondral ossification to produce a phenotype characteristic of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> group of human <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
