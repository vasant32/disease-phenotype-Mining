<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> members of the family contain a highly conserved region of thrombospondin type 3 sequence repeats that bind calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mutation in COMP previously identified in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> resulted in abnormal sequestration of COMP in distinctive rER vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation, Asp-446 --&gt; Asn, is located in the type 3 repeats of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This region was expressed in a mammalian culture with and without the mutation to study the structural or functional properties associated with the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biophysical parameters of the mutant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were compared with those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and revealed the following difference: secondary structural analysis by circular dichroism showed more alpha-helix content in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calcium binding properties of the two <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> were significantly different; there were 17 calcium ions bound/<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP3 <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> compared with 8/mutant <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP3 had a higher affinity for calcium and bound calcium more cooperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Calcium bound by the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was reflected in a structural change as indicted by velocity sedimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the effect of the COMP mutation appears to profoundly alter the calcium binding properties and may account for the difference observed in the structure of the type 3 domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the highly cooperative binding of calcium to COMP3 suggests that these type 3 sequence repeats form a single protein domain, the thrombospondin type 3 domain </plain></SENT>
