<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first series included 5 patients referred to our neurosurgical department for macrocranium and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second series was composed of 20 patients arbitrarily chosen from a medical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Macrocranium was observed in 60% of the patients and was related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiological studies demonstrated that the posterior fossa was deformed and narrowed in its 3 planes, while its volume was conserved because of an abnormal ascension of the tentorium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conflict between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain development and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> at the base of the skull is responsible for an upward tilt of the petrous pyramids, a lowering of the mastoid process, and the illusion of a basilar invagination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventriculographies, pneumoencephalographies and isotopic transits demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CSF circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is related to the stenosis of the sigmoid sinus at the level of narrowed jugular foramina with a resulting raise in intracranial venous pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with macrocranium stabilizes spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, a surgical indication should be extremely limited </plain></SENT>
