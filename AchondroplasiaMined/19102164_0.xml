<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 54 patients (male 28, female 26, mean age 22) who performed tibial lengthening by metaphyseal osteotomy using two-axis parallel method, 26 patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">poliomyelitis</z:e> sequelae, 13 patients were inequality in limb length after trauma, 4 patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, 6 patients were genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, 1 patient was maculatum disease complicated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leg length discrepancy</z:e>, 4 patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000839'>pituitary dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were followed up and the duration ranged from 18 months to 45 months, with an average of 24.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had bone lengthened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum increase of limb length was 12 cm and the minimum increase was 5 cm, averaged 6.2 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo>, 2 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003377'>foot drop</z:hpo> complicated with strephexopodia, 1 patient had serious pinhole <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and 1 patient had delayed union of the bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The two-axis parallel method tibial lengthening by metaphyseal osteotomy can reduce postoperative complications and simplify the operative procedure, which is an ideal method for bone lengthening </plain></SENT>
