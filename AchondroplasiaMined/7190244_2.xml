<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normally, the direction of flow in this emissary vein is into the orbit </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This indicates that ophthalmic vein blood flow is reversed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplastic dwarfs</z:e>, perhaps because there is a pressure gradient between the intracranial and extracranial venous systems </plain></SENT>
