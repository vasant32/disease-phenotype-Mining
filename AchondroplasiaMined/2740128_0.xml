<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells and the intercellular substance of the cartilaginous graft plate from the upper flaring portion of the ileum of the patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common feature of most conditions were changes on the part of the granular endoplasmatic net, which points at a disturbance in the function of the synthesis apparatus and/or of the transport of the synthesized <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33694">biopolymers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No morphological changes were revealed in the cartilaginous graft plate which were pathognomonic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0009877'>exostosis</z:mp> <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of the forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (its severe dominant heritable variation) there were specific inclusions in the chondrocytes of the patients, which apparently were a morphological manifestation of disturbed assembly of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> aggregates which is the basis of the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possibility of using this morphological marker in the clinico-genetic classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e>, in differential diagnosis of the disease in unclear cases as well as in medico-genetic consulting of the patients' families is discussed </plain></SENT>
