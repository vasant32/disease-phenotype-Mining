<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single limb (femur and tibia) was operated on and the change in actual length of each bone and the percentage change in growth compared to that of the non-operated limb was measured by scanogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean absolute increase in growth was small, measuring 3 mm for the femur and 2 mm for the tibia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no measurable growth difference after 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method of increasing limb length in achondroplastic children prior to definitive and extensive lengthening procedures is not recommended </plain></SENT>
