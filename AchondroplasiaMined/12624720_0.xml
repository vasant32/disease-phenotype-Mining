<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> and constructional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo> were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was an achondroplasic dwarf whose previous medical and neurological history was otherwise unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the brain showed a large right temporo-insulofrontoparietal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Language and nonverbal cognitive functions were assessed after 2 and 6 months, and then four years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reportedly overall language disruption in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period evolved into Wernicke's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and then into a mild form of conduction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The associated left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e> eventually shrank to a minimum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient never had clinically detectable visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo>, but on specific tests of visual recognition and perception some impairment was found four years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> disappeared in time while the left hemianopia persisted </plain></SENT>
