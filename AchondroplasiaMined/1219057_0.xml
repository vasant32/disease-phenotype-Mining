<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> of the condition was studied in embryos produced parthenogenetically from virgin dams and also in embryos from the same dams in bisexual matings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression was similar to other forms of the disorder encountered in various avian species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002983'>Micromelia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> were recognized in affected embryos after 9 days while <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> occurred mainly after 16 days of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A few affected embryos expressed modified phenotypes and these were also nonviable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modified phenotypes were not observed in parthenogenetic production, and it was thus inferred that such embryos may have been heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No changes were evident when the genetic background was altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The condition was inherited as a single, autosomal, recessive lethal, in both parthenogenetic progeny and in progeny from bisexual matings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The symbol ch is designated for the mutant allele </plain></SENT>
