<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the interaction of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and CNP signaling in chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CNP antagonized FGF2-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> of rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0006765'>chondrosarcoma</z:hpo> (RCS) chondrocytes by inhibition of the Erk <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinase pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect of CNP was protein kinase G-dependent and was mimicked by the cGMP analog pCPT-cGMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FGF2-mediated activation of both MEK and Raf-1 but not Ras or FRS2 was abolished by CNP demonstrating that CNP blocks the Erk pathway at the level of Raf-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CNP also counteracted the FGF2-mediated degradation of RCS extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CNP partially antagonized FGF2-induced expression, release and activation of several matrix-remodeling molecules including matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP3, MMP9, MMP10 and MMP13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, CNP compensated for FGF2-mediated matrix loss by upregulation of matrix production independent of its interference with FGF signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that CNP utilizes both direct and indirect ways to counteract the effects of FGF signaling in a chondrocyte environment </plain></SENT>
