<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 regulates bone growth in part via the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of this pathway in chondrocyte differentiation, a transgenic mouse was generated that expresses a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 in chondrocytes and exhibits dwarfing characteristics typical of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, i.e., shortened axial and appendicular skeletons, mid-facial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and dome-shaped cranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, cephalometrics of the MEK1 mutant skulls were assessed to determine if the MEK1 mice are a good model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skull length, arc of the cranial vault, and area, maximum and minimum diameters of the brain case were measured on digitized radiographs of skulls of MEK1 and control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial base and nasal bone length and foramen magnum diameter were measured on midsagittal micro-CT sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were normalized by dividing by the cube root of each animal's weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice exhibited a domed skull, deficient midface, and (relatively) prognathic mandible and had a shorter cranial base and nasal bone than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Skull length was significantly less in transgenic mice, but cranial arc was significantly greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The brain case was larger and more circular and minimum diameter of the brain case was significantly greater in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The foramen magnum was displaced anteriorly but not narrowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MEK1 mouse cephalometrics confirm these mice as a model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, demonstrating that the MAP kinase signaling pathway is involved in FGF signaling in skeletal development </plain></SENT>
