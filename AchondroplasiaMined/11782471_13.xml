<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations that cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and EDM1 are restricted to a 27-kDa Ca(2+) binding domain (type 3 repeat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This domain has 13 Ca(2+)-binding loops with a consensus sequence that conforms to Ca(2+)-binding loops found in EF hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most disease-causing mutations are found in the 11-kDa C-terminal region of this domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We expressed recombinant native and mutant forms of the type 3 repeat domain (T3) and its 11-kDa C-terminal region (T3-Cterm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T3 and T3-Cterm bind approximately 13 and 8 mol of Ca(2+)/mol of protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD, one-dimensional proton, and two-dimensional (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra of Ca(2+)-bound T3-Cterm indicate a distinct conformation that has little helical secondary structure, despite the presence of 13 EF hand Ca(2+)-binding loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This conformation is also formed within the context of the intact T3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>19 cross-peaks found between 9.0 and 11.4 ppm are consistent with the presence of strong hydrogen bonding patterns, such as those in beta-sheets </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra of mutated T3-Cterm showed little evidence of defined structure in the presence or absence of Ca(2+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data demonstrate that Ca(2+) is required to nucleate folding and to maintain defined structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mutation results in a partial loss of Ca(2+)-binding capacity and prevents Ca(2+)-dependent folding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Persistence of an unstructured state of the mutated Ca(2+) binding domain in COMP is the structural basis for retention of COMP in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and EDM1 chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
