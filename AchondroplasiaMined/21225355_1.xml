<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We report aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> in a cohort of achondroplastic children who attended our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for a 15-year period to further evaluate the diagnosis and treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A review of the medical records was undertaken for 46 children (63%, mean age 3.9 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> that had overnight polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 25 (54.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For 19 out of 46 patients (follow-up rate, 41.3%) with a mean follow-up of 31.3 months (range, 3 month to 11 years), 13 had undergone adenotonsillectomy, while nine were treated with continuous positive airway pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prospective evaluation of our clinic population confirms a high incidence of SDB in achondroplastic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OSA has been linked to raise intracranial pressure as well as neurocognitive deficits in children and we hypothesize that associations between neurological and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002086'>respiratory abnormalities</z:hpo> in this disorder are a consequence of the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of associated respiratory, rather than the neurological complications </plain></SENT>
