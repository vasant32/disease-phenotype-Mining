<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured the extent and rate of new bone formation over an 18-month period before, during and after the lengthening of ten leg segments in six patients aged between 8 and 18 years, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New bone formation could be identified within one week of the start of distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As lengthening proceeded, the bone density of the gap fell, reaching minimum values at the time of maximal distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consolidation of the regenerating bone was started 1 to 2 weeks later in the tibia, and 2.5 to 3.0 weeks later in the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of mineral accretion in new bone was significantly greater in the tibia than in the femur (16 +/- 1.86%/month, and 11 +/- 1.1%/month respectively; mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> distal to the osteotomy, more in the tibia than in the femur, particularly on the side of the fixator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bone mineral density of the distal segment remained low at the time of fixator removal (44.2 +/- 5.58% and 61.0 +/- 4.2% of the control values at the tibia and femur respectively) and was only partially reversed by subsequent weight-bearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provides an objective and quantitative assessment of new bone formation during leg lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technique also allows the measurement of the distraction gap and the assessment of leg alignment from the high-resolution images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Its use may decrease the requirements for conventional radiography </plain></SENT>
