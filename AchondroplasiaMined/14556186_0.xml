<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA from peripheral blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members in this family was used for amplification of the exon 10 of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene by PCR; mutation was detected by DNA sequencing and identified by restriction endonuclease MaeIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A new mutation of A to T at nucleotide 1180 was found in patients but not in unaffected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined with pedigree analysis, it was summarized that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients in this family might result from this new mutation </plain></SENT>
