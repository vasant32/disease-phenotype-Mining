<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Extensive limb lengthening may be indicated in achondroplastic patients who wish to achieve a height within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range for their population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, increasing the magnitude of lengthening is associated with further complications particularly adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001387'>joint stiffness</z:hpo> and fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between the magnitude of femoral lengthening and callus pattern, adjacent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001387'>joint stiffness</z:hpo> and fracture of the regenerate bone in 40 femoral lengthenings in 20 achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were divided into two groups; group A had lengthening of less than 50% and group B of more than 50% of their initial femoral length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patterns of radiological callus formation were classified according to shape, type and features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of callus features, knee stiffness and regenerate bone fracture were analysed in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group B was associated with an increased incidence of concave, lateral and central callus shapes, adjacent joint and stiffness and fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically, the incidence of stiffness in adjacent joints and regenerate bone fracture was significantly associated with the magnitude of lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that careful radiological assessment of the patterns of callus formation is a useful method for the evaluation and monitoring of regenerate bone </plain></SENT>
