<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most previous work in this area has focused on embryonic chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explore the role of FGF signaling in the postnatal growth plate, we quantitated expression of FGFs and FGF receptors (FGFRs) and examined both their spatial and temporal regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toward this aim, rat proximal tibial growth plates and surrounding tissues were microdissected, and specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To assess the FGF system without bias, we first screened for expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known FGFs and major FGFR isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perichondrium expressed FGFs 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, and 18 and, at lower levels, FGFs 21 and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Growth plate expressed FGFs 2, 7, 18, and 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perichondrial expression was generally greater than growth plate expression, supporting the concept that perichondrial FGFs regulate growth plate chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, FGFs synthesized by growth plate chondrocytes may be physiologically important because of their proximity to target receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In growth plate, we found expression of FGFRs 1, 2, and 3, primarily, but not exclusively, the c isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>FGFRs 1 and 3, thought to negatively regulate chondrogenesis, were expressed at greater levels and at later stages of chondrocyte differentiation, with FGFR1 upregulated in the hypertrophic zone and FGFR3 upregulated in both proliferative and hypertrophic zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FGFRs 2 and 4, putative positive regulators, were expressed at earlier stages of differentiation, with FGFR2 upregulated in the resting zone and FGFR4 in the resting and proliferative zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FGFRL1, a presumed decoy receptor, was expressed in the resting zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With increasing age and decreasing growth velocity, FGFR2 and 4 expression was downregulated in proliferative zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Perichondrial FGF1, FGF7, FGF18, and FGF22 were upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have analyzed the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known FGFs and FGFRs in the postnatal growth plate using a method that is quantitative and highly sensitive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This approach identified ligands and receptors not previously known to be expressed in growth plate and revealed a complex pattern of spatial regulation of FGFs and FGFRs in the different zones of the growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We also found temporal changes in FGF and FGFR expression which may contribute to growth plate senescence and thus help determine the size of the adult skeleton </plain></SENT>
