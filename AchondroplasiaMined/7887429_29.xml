<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated and followed an unbiased and unselected consecutive series of infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, to better document the occurrence, frequency, and clinical presentation of craniocervical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 53 prospectively ascertained infants, 5 were judged to have sufficient craniocervical junction compression to require surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative observation always showed marked abnormality of the cervical spinal cord, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operated-on children showed marked improvement of neurological function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical abnormalities within this subset were those expected for high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
