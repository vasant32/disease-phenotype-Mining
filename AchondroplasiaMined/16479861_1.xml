<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 3D surface scanner Fiore and its software were used to acquire the 3D scans of the faces while 3D Rugle3 and locally-developed software generated the holistic facial averages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3D facial averages were created from two ethnic groups; European and Japanese and from children with three previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e> as well as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method included averaging the corresponding depth (z) coordinates of the 3D facial scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with other face averaging techniques there was not any warping or filling in the spaces by interpolation; however, this facial average lacked colour information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that as few as 14 faces were sufficient to create an archetypal facial average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In turn this would make it practical to use face averaging as an identification tool in cases where it would be difficult to recruit a larger number of participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In generating the average, correcting for size differences among faces was shown to adjust the average outlines of the facial features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that 3D facial averaging would help in the identification of the ethnic status of persons whose identity may not be known with certainty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In clinical medicine, it would have a great potential for the diagnosis of syndromes with distinctive facial features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The system would also assist in the education of clinicians in the recognition and identification of such syndromes </plain></SENT>
