<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The obtained lengths were 4.4 cm (17% of the tibial length), 3.7 cm (12%) and 3.6 cm (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone formation at the site of distraction was thought to be periosteal in origin when assessed using X-rays and computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no radiological evidence that bone at the distracted sites was formed by an apposition from the metaphyseal side which is expected in cases of stimulation of endochondral ossification in the growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no further measurable growth at the distracted growth plates after lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method is useful for limb lengthening near the time of epiphyseal closure </plain></SENT>
