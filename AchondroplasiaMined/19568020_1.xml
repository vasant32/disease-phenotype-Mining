<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stenosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> are common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, often requiring lumbar fusion, sometimes to the sacrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the functional effect of lumbar fusion to the sacrum in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Functional and SF-36 questionnaires were sent to the 66 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who underwent instrumented lumbar fusion at our institution from 1991 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 who returned questionnaires, 13 had fusions to the sacrum and 22 did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chi-square analysis and a t test were used to evaluate outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance was set at P&lt;0.05 or a 95% confidence interval that did not cross 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in SF-36 scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward more pain in the group fused to the sacrum (P=0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in difficulty with activities, but there was a trend toward increased difficulty with hygiene after toileting in the group with fusion to the sacrum (odds ratio: 3.76, confidence interval: 0.53-26.87, P=0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fusion to the sacrum did not significantly affect function in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, although there was a trend toward increased pain and greater difficulty with hygiene after toileting </plain></SENT>
