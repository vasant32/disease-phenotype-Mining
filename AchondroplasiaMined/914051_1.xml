<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were observed in either <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24586">hexosamine</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extractable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> from control and mutant tissue were found to contain a similar distribution of aggregate and monomer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The component <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> were similar in size and composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collagen from both was identified as type II collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the collagen content of hind limb bones of 28 day dwarf mice was found to be similar to control amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> in the cn/cn mouse is not associated with a defect in any of the major matrix constituents </plain></SENT>
