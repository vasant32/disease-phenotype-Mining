<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurements of bone, fat, and lean mass were obtained with a Hologic 1000W instrument </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following variables are used to compare the subject with the 130 healthy white girls who participated in the study: bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ratios of BMC to weight or BMC to height, and BMD to weight or height, were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the BMC of the subject was lower when compared to the reference group, but the ratios of BMC to weight or BMC to height were similar in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMD was also lower in the patient, but, when expressed in relation to height and weight, the ratios were similar or slightly higher in the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMAD was higher in the subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The subject had a lower percentage fat and higher percentage lean mass than the reference children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the accumulation of bone mass in this subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is appropriate for her <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>reduced body size</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
