<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The responsible gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> has been identified to be ribonuclease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-processing (RMRP) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined RMRP genes of a 3-year-old Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> boy and his family and revealed a novel mutation: 20 bp duplication (TACTCTGTGAAGCTGAGGAC), in promoter region of maternal allele, at nucleotide -3 and a reported 218A&gt;G point mutation in transcribed region of paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> has been established so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Growth hormone (GH) action has its effect on linear growth and on bone remodeling and homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recently, GH has been used to improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> caused by not only GH deficiency (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e>) but also some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo>, we treated the patient with 0.175 mg kg-1 week-1 of GH for 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His height was improved from -4.2 SD to -3.0 SD by 1 year of GH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following treatment had given positive effects continuously on his height to -2.6 SD by 3.1 years GH medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Then, when he was 6 years old, surgical lengthening was performed and his height reached to -2.0 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the surgery, we continued GH treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional GH treatment of 3.6 more years had kept his height to -2.0 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, when he was 8 years old, because there was an interruption of GH treatment, the velocity of his height was obviously decreased comparing before and during the interruption, which was calculated 3.4 and 2.2 cm/year, respectively, and the SD score was decreased to -2.1 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This result of total 7 years of GH treatment suggested that GH treatment significantly improved his disturbed bone growth and had also positive efficacy to keep growth rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This result implies the connection between GH signal and RMRP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additionally, GH may be considered to be an efficient treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
