<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Femoral cortex penetration can and does occur with uncemented hip arthroplasty and is likely to occur when surgical exposure is difficult and inadequate (such as in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>) or some form of proximal femoral deformity exists (such as patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extra diligence should be exercised to avoid this complication in the high-risk patients, and adequate 2-plain radiographs may need to be ordered intraoperatively if such complication is suspected </plain></SENT>
