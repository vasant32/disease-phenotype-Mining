<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Breeding experiments showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23345">cby</z:chebi> is a recessive mutant with complete viability, full penetrance and fertility in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tests for allelism showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23345">cby</z:chebi> mutant is genetically unlike the somewhat similar mutants, stumpy (stm), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pituitary dwarf</z:e> (dw), spondylometaphyseal <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> (smc), brachymorphic (bm), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (cn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The defects seem to occur mainly in growth cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microradiography revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0001254'>increased height</z:mp> of the epiphyseal growth plate and irregular bone trabeculae in the metaphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light microscopy showed disturbed columnar organization of proliferative chondrocytes and pronounced signs of cellular disintegration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hypertrophic zone, however, contained normally shaped chondrocytes arranged in regular columns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0005482'>cellular hypertrophy</z:mp> the pattern of cartilage mineralization was disturbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electron microscopy studies revealed very high amounts of matrix vesicles and numerous larger membrane coated structures in the extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis of the affected growth cartilage revealed a slightly modified pattern of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> subpopulations and considerably longer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> chains when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the present study it can be concluded that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23345">cby</z:chebi> mutant is a genetically and morphologically distinct condition with characteristic, somewhat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002748'>rickets</z:hpo>-like stigmata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic mechanism underlying the condition remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
