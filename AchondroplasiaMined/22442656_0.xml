<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>Thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> (TLK) is described as a common presentation in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence and development of TLK are ill-defined, as well as its clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess the existing evidence on the prevalence and development of TLK from the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Thomson Reuters (ISI) Web of Knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Articles were selected and evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale in duplicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Articles were included when the included patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and the prevalence of TLK in this population was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of TLK varied between 50 and 100%, but the populations differed significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, the measurement method and definition of TLK was not given in any of the included studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two studies reported TLK in different age categories, but the development of TLK through age could not be inferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, the methodological quality was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of TLK in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> could not be assessed from the literature because the populations differed and the definition of TLK in the studies was not described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In future studies, this definition needs to be given and patients need to be assessed over a longer period of time, with repeated assessments </plain></SENT>
