<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They rarely lead to major neurologic and/or psychomotor deficits and neurosurgical intervention is seldom needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to detect signs of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> and discuss possibilities of their prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were compared to 3 control groups: their next-born sibs, 30 children with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, and 30 children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early development was assessed by means of questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive skills were evaluated with the German version of the Cognitive Abilities Test and the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Personality data were tested using standardized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027932" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neuroticism</z:e>, extraversion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had more frequent histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor development</z:hpo>, retarded speech development, and lower school grades in language-related specialties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Psychometric testing disclosed total and subtest scores in the population-based <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>

We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle ear infections</z:e> and resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
