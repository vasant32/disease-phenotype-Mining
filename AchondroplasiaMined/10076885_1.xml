<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The question of why Hephaestus, the Greek god of smiths, limped has been the subject of much debate, mainly on mythological grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This debate extended also into the field of medical diagnosis, with attempts at defining the nature of the deformity that made the crippled Hephaestus the buffoon of the other Olympic gods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One problem encountered in these debates was the changes to which the ugly young Hephaestus was subjected with the passing of time-from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822,C0311395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">limping</z:e> deformed youth to the later dignified and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While some authors, largely influenced by poetic Greek texts and vase paintings, attributed the limp to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001883'>talipes</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>club-feet</z:hpo>), others pointed to certain features suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the image of the early Hephaestus is based mainly on the much earlier concept of the Egyptian god Ptah, who as the triune god of the resurrection sometimes is depicted as an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplastic dwarf</z:e> (Ptah-Pataikos), the suggestion of the possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplastic dwarf</z:e>-like nature of the early Hephaestus is not implausible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is supported by similarities in the image of Hephaestus to some features in other Egyptian gods, such as the domestic god Bes, the guardian of the new-born, and the Horus the Child or Harpocrates (Greek), yet another protector of youth and "the symbol of everything that is young and vigorous" [Budge, 1969: The Gods of the Egyptians, or Studies in Egyptian Mythology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Volume I.] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The characteristic feature of this child-god is the "lock of Harpocrates" on the right side of his head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That this lock can sometimes also be seen not only on the head of Ptah-Pataikos and of Bes but also on the young Hephaestus is highly suggestive of the Egyptian influence on his image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, another interesting explanation of Hephaestus's limp has been suggested that may explain why the Egyptian influenced image of the early achondroplastic Hephaestus changed to the later, more Grecian view of the smith-god who hobbled because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001762'>club-feet</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Improvements in composition-analysis of samples from antique statues and various utensils have led to the suggestion that the introduction of new smelting techniques in antique times may have exposed ancient metal workers to the effects of various toxic metals causing, for instance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lead poisoning or, more relevant here, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="107" ids="27563">arsenic</z:chebi> poisoning causing peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>neuritis</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822,C0311395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Finding" abbrv="">lameness</z:e> of one or both lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Later changes in smelting technique, and recognition or guess-work of a possible connection between these techniques and toxic effects, may explain the change from the buffoon-like achondroplastic walk to the club-footed limp and eventual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> behaviour of Hephaestus, the Smith </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="?"><plain>In other words: Did Hephaestus limp because of his <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27563">arsen</z:chebi>-<z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>neuritis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
