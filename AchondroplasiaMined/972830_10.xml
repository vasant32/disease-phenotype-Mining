<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The histopathologic findings were sufficiently distinctive in most categories to provide additional diagnostic criteria and to contribute to the understanding and delineation of these disorders </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The zone of resting cartilage contains relatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> matrix, and the chondrocytes contain intracytoplasmic inclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cartilaginous matrix in type 2 is markedly deficient, and the chondrocytes have a large, primitive, mesenchymatous appearance </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thanatophoric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> is associated with disorganized endochondral ossification similar to that in homozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, but there is no accumulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> within chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Type 2 thanatophoric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> is differentiated from classical type 1 by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> and histologically by many bone-lined, penetrating vascular canals in the physis and by <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the metaphysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Type 1 is characterized by patchy distribution of endochondral ossification in the physis, irregular physeal-metaphyseal junction and large islands of poorly mineralized cartilage in the metaphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Type 2 is characterized by uniform distribution of endochondral ossification that is disorganized and is accompanied by advancing cartilage forming latticelike meshwork in the metaphysis </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Disorganized endochondral ossification is, however, uniformly distributed, and there is no latticelike advancing cartilage in the metaphysis </plain></SENT>
