<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Population-based recruitment from October 2008 to October 2010 identified 44 Australian children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> aged 3 to 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consenting parents of 35 children (16 males, 19 females 14 aged 3y; 12 aged 5y; nine aged 7y) reported their child's self-care, mobility, and social cognition function using the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM-II) at the ages of 3 (n=14), 5 (n=12), or 7 (n=9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children were excluded from the study if they had an additional neurological or musculoskeletal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Functioning improved in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> between the ages of 3 and 5 years, but not subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Milestones in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> group were delayed across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages and domains compared with normative reference data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> required greater caregiver assistance for self-care and mobility skills than typically developing children based on normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Social cognition appeared to be an area of relative strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Children up to 7 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> show delayed milestone acquisition and a greater need for caregiver assistance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As functional delays are likely to be related to common musculoskeletal impairments associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, access to physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language pathologists skilled in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> management may assist children and families to become more independent, particularly around the time of starting school </plain></SENT>
