<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of structural obstruction, bethanechol can be used in patients with (1) the early phase of coordinated reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0000011'>neurogenic bladder</z:hpo> and sphincter when there is incomplete bladder emptying due to feeble or unsustained detrusor contractions, (2) recovery phase of spinal shock when the periurethral striated muscle has recovered and is under voluntary control, (3) incomplete motor paralytic bladder with coordinated sphincter, and (4) sensory paralytic bladder with decompensation </plain></SENT>
