<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possibility of an early diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 149 consecutive, uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at 9-13 weeks' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000141'>amenorrhea</z:hpo>, with certain menstrual history and regular cycles, were investigated with transvaginal ultrasound to establish the relationship between femur length and menstrual age, biparietal diameter and crown-rump length, using a polynomial regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A further eight patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> in a total of 13 pregnancies were evaluated with serial examinations every 2 weeks from 10-11 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation between femur length and crown-rump length and biparietal diameter was found, whereas none was observed between femur length and menstrual age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the five cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, only two (one with recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> and one with recurrent achondrogenesis) were diagnosed in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An early evaluation of fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in conjunction with the use of biometric charts of femur length against crown-rump length and femur length against biparietal diameter may be crucial for early diagnosis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in less severe cases, biometric evaluation appears to be of no value for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
