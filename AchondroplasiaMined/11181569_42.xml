<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An engineered Ser(365)--&gt;Cys substitution in mouse FGFR3, which is equivalent to a mutation associated with thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-I in humans, has now been shown to cause severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutant mice exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0009815'>shortened limbs</z:hpo> as a result of markedly reduced proliferation and impaired differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The receptor-activating mutation also resulted in downregulation of expression of the Indian hedgehog (IHH) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) receptor genes, both of which are important for bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interactions between FGFR3- and PTHrP-receptor-mediated signals during endochondral ossification were examined with embryonic metatarsal bones maintained in culture under defined conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the in vivo observations, FGF2 inhibited bone growth in culture and induced downregulation of IHH and PTHrP receptor gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PTHrP partially reversed the inhibition of long bone growth caused by activation of FGFR3; however, it impaired the differentiation of chondrocytes in an FGFR3-independent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that FGFR3 and IHH-PTHrP signals are transmitted by two interacting parallel pathways that mediate both overlapping and distinct functions during endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
