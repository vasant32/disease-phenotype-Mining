<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative clinical homogeneity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was substantiated by demonstration of its genetic homogeneity as more than 98% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients hitherto reported exhibit mutations in the transmembrane receptor domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although most hypochondroplasia cases were accounted for by a recurrent missense substitution (N540K) in the first tyrosine kinase (TK 1) domain of the receptor, a significant proportion (40%) of our patients did not harbor the N540K mutation and three hypochondroplasia families were not linked to the FGFR-3 locus, thus supporting clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In thanatophoric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> (TD), a recurrent FGFR-3 mutation located in the second tyrosine kinase (TK 2) domain of the receptor was originally detected in 100% of TD II cases, our series seven distinct mutations in three different protein domains were identified in 25 of 26 TD I patients, suggesting that TD, like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, is a genetically homogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
