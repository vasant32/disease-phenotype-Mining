<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The growth zone was narrow and disorganized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Columnization was absent except for a few areas with short rows of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>Hypertrophy</z:mpath> was reduced to scattered clusters of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The provisional calcification was patchy and primary trabeculae were thick and irregularly arranged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Islands of fibrous or fibrocartilagineous tissue were found along the growth zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The matrix did not stain with safranin O and lacked metachromasia, except for pericellular rims around the hypertrophic cell clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Staining with antibodies against the large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> monomers and chondroitin-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> was weakly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination showed that only a few cells had degenerative signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most areas of the matrix, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> granules were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Areas with dense collagen fibers were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the growth zone, the cartilage of the remaining epiphyses had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histochemical, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> monomers had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> composition and hydrodynamic size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Type II and XI collagen, pepsin fragments of type IX collagen, and several noncollagenous proteins extracted from cartilage had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electrophoretic migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that a mutation affecting a matrix component or a regulatory pathway present only or predominantly in the growth area of the chondroepiphysis might explain the findings </plain></SENT>
