<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene family recently have been shown to underlie several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disorders</z:e> of bone development, with specific FGFR3 mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>) and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, for none of these mutations has the defect in receptor function been demonstrated directly and, therefore, for none has the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease been defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using our established techniques for single-cell ratiometric real-time calcium image analysis, we defined the nature of the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced calcium signal in human diploid fibroblasts, and, in blinded studies, have analyzed the bFGF-induced signals from 18 independent fibroblast cell lines, including multiple lines from patients with known mutant alleles of FGFR3 and syndromes of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> or TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control cells responded with transient increases in intracellular calcium, with many cells showing oscillatory calcium waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> cell lines failed to signal, whereas heterozygous <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> lines responded nearly normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> signals in TD heterozygotes: the unresponsive lines <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> turned out to carry TD1 alleles, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responsive lines had TD2 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since FGFR1, 2 and 3 receptors are known to be expressed in fibroblasts, our results suggest that specific mutant FGFR3 alleles can function in a dosage-dependent dominant-negative fashion to inactivate FGFR signaling </plain></SENT>
