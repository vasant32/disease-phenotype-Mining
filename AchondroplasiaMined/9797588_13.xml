<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to document lung growth during infancy, together with the cause of any cardiorespiratory and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0565800" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">sleep dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen prospectively ascertained infants (14 boys and three girls) with respiratory symptoms starting before 1 year of age underwent clinical, sleep, and lung function studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three distinct groups were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 (n = 6) were the least symptomatic and only had obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group 2 (n = 6) had obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> of muscular aetiology and, neurologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002677'>small foramen magnum</z:hpo> were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group 3 (n = 5), the most severely affected group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001648'>cor pulmonale</z:hpo>, with three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring as a result of terminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877147" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiorespiratory failure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five had obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> with a muscular aetiology (a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002677'>small foramen magnum</z:hpo> predominated) with severe or moderately severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GERD">gastro-oesophageal reflux</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initially, lung function studies found no evidence of restriction or reduced lung volumes standardised according to weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, with growth these infants had worsening function, with raised airway resistance and severe reductions in respiratory compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These groups appear to be distinct phenotypes with distinct anatomical aetiologies: "relative" adenotonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, resulting from a degree of midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (group 1); muscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> along with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, resulting from jugular foramen stenosis (group 2); and muscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo>, but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, resulting from hypoglossal canal stenosis with or without foramen magnum compression and no jugular foramen stenosis (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of these abnormalities is consistent with localised alteration of chondrocranial development: rostral, intermediary and caudal in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
