<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mapping of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> locus to the short arm of chromosome 4 and the subsequent identification of a recurrent missense mutation (Gly380Arg) in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) has been followed by the detection of common FGFR-3 mutations in two clinically related disorders: thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD; types I and II) and hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative clinical homogeneity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was substantiated by demonstration of its genetic homogeneity: 100% of patients examined exhibited mutations in the transmembrane domain of FGFR-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although most cases of hypochondroplasia were accounted for by a recurrent missense substitution (Asn540Lys) in the first tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR-3, a significant proportion (40%) of the patients in the present study did not possess this Asn540Lys mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in three families with hypochondroplasia, the genetic defect was not linked to the FGFR-3 locus, thus supporting the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In TD, a recurrent mutation located in the second tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR-3 has been detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> TDII patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, seven distinct mutations in three different protein domains were identified in 25 out of 26 TDI patients in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that TD, like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, is a genetically homogeneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
