<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The FGFR2c C342Y mutation is a frequent cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, characterized by premature cranial vault suture closure, midfacial deficiency, and neurocranial dysmorphology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, using newborn Fgfr2c(C342Y/+) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> mice, we tested whether the phenotypic effects of this mutation go beyond the skeletal tissues of the skull, altering the development of other non-skeletal head tissues including the brain, the eyes, the nasopharynx, and the inner ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of 3D multimodal imaging (high-resolution micro-computed tomography and magnetic resonance microscopy) revealed local differences in skull <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and coronal suture patency between Fgfr2c(C342Y/+) mice and unaffected littermates, as well as changes in brain shape but not brain size, significant reductions in nasopharyngeal and eye volumes, and no difference in inner ear volume in Fgfr2c(C342Y/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide an expanded catalogue of clinical phenotypes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> caused by aberrant FGF/FGFR signaling and evidence of the broad role for FGF/FGFR signaling in development and evolution of the vertebrate head </plain></SENT>
