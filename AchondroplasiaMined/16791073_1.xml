<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to analyze lower extremity dynamic malalignment during gait using a 3-dimensional kinematics and kinetics in 13 children (3-17 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and to compare measurements of alignment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002566'>malrotation</z:hpo> between gait, radiographic, and clinical measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gait analysis in the coronal plane showed a varus malalignment of the knee (19 +/- 13 degrees) and variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100694'>tibial torsion</z:hpo> abnormalities (13 [internal] +/- 15.7 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiographs also showed knee varus malalignment (16 +/- 9 degrees); however, there was poor correlation with gait analysis measures (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the sagittal plane, radiographs showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002816'>genu recurvatum</z:hpo> deformity (23.5 +/- 13.2 degrees), although the sagittal plane knee kinematics were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analyses of the knee showed high internal knee valgus moments (external varus moments, 0.48 +/- 0.25 N m/kg), which were significantly different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there is a 3-dimensional, complex, dynamic deformity of the lower extremity present in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recommend a very careful assessment of the limb focusing on both the static and dynamic varus deformity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100694'>tibial torsion</z:hpo> using a combination of radiographic, clinical, and gait analysis </plain></SENT>
