<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the gene for human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (hFGFR3) cause a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, including the most common genetic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence indicates that these phenotypes are not due to simple haploinsufficiency of FGFR3 but are more likely related to a role in negatively regulating skeletal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of one of these mutations on FGFR3 signaling were examined by constructing chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular domain of human platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (hPDGFR beta) and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of hFGFR3 or of an ACH (G375C) mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following stable transfection in PC12 cells, which lack platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clonal cell lines, with either type of chimera, showed strong neurite outgrowth in the presence of PDGF but not in its absence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots showed ligand-dependent autophosphorylation, and both receptor types stimulated strong phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, an event associated with the differentiative response of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, ligand-dependent phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma and Shc was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these responses were comparable to those observed from ligand activation, such as by nerve growth factor, of the native PC12 cells used to prepare the stable transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cells with the chimera bearing the ACH mutation were more rapidly responsive to ligand with less sustained MAPK activation, indicative of a preactivated or primed condition and consistent with the view that these mutations weaken ligand control of FGFR3 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the full effect of the mutation likely depends in part on structural features of the extracellular domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although FGFR3 has been suggested to act as a negative regulator of long-bone growth in chrondrocytes, it produces differentiative signals similar to those of FGFR1, to which only positive effects have been ascribed, in PC12 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its regulatory effects on bone growth likely result from cellular contexts and not the induction of a unique FGFR3 signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
