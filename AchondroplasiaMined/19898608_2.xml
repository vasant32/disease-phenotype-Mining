<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)3 plays a role in bone development and maintenance and belongs to a family of proteins which differ in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations of the FGFR3 gene lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and multiple types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> with varying degrees of severity: thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite progress in the characterization of FGFR3-mediated regulation of cartilage development, many aspects remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim and the novelty of our study was to examine whole gene expression differences occurring in primary human chondrocytes isolated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cartilage or pathological cartilage from TD-affected fetuses, using Affymetrix technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of the primary cells was confirmed by the high expression of chondrocytic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered expression of genes associated with many cellular processes was observed, including cell growth and proliferation, cell cycle, cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, cell motility, metabolic pathways, signal transduction, cell cycle process and cell signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most of the cell cycle process genes were down-regulated and consisted of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA biosynthesis, spindle dynamics and cytokinesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>About eight percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> modulated genes were found to impact extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and turnover, especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> (GAG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> biosynthesis and sulfation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the gene expression analyses provide new insight into the consequences of FGFR3 mutations in cell cycle regulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pre-hypertrophic differentiation and concomitant metabolism changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, impaired motility and ECM properties may also provide clues about growth plate disorganization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results also suggest that many signaling pathways may be directly or indirectly altered by FGFR3 and confirm the crucial role of FGFR3 in the control of growth plate development </plain></SENT>
