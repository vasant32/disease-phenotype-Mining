<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have investigated genetic linkage of von <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406030" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Recklinghausen</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> (NF1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) using chromosome-17 markers that are known to be linked to NF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical proximity of the two loci was suggested by the report of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and the de novo occurrence of both NF1 and ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the chance of de novo occurrence of these two disorders in one individual is 1 in 600 million, this suggested a chromosomal deletion as a single unifying molecular event and also that the ACH and NF1 loci might be physically close </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this, we performed linkage analysis on a three-generation family with ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used seven DNA probes that are tightly linked to the NF1 locus, including DNA sequences that are known to flank the NF1 locus on the centromeric and telomeric side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected two recombinants between the ACH trait and markers flanking the NF1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one recombinant, the flanking markers themselves were nonrecombinant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multi-point linkage analysis excluded the ACH locus from a region surrounding the NF1 locus that spans more than 15 cM (lod score less than -2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, analysis of this ACH pedigree suggests that the ACH locus is not linked to the NF1 locus on chromosome 17 </plain></SENT>
