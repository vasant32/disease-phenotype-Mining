<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies were performed before surgery, during lengthening using the Ilizarov external fixator, during the fixation period following distraction, and after apparatus removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data compiled using these modalities described alterations in the muscles during lengthening which enabled us to develop algorithms for patient examination during the process of lower extremity lengthening with the aim of solving tactical tasks </plain></SENT>
