<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results and complications of bifocal tibial osteotomies with gradual correction and lengthening by Ilizarov ring fixator performed in 47 tibiae in 24 achondroplastic patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison was made between the parameters of angular and torsional deformities of the tibia preoperatively, at fixator removal, and at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these parameters, statistically significant change was seen postoperatively in the values of medial proximal tibial angle, lateral distal tibial angle, mechanical axis deviation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100694'>tibial torsion</z:hpo>, which changed from 78.8 +/- 7.05 degrees, 103.2 +/- 11.8 degrees, 25.1 +/- 14.6 mm (medial), and 22.7 +/- 10 degrees (internal) preoperatively to 87.3 +/- 6.3 degrees, 90.9 +/- 5.4 degrees, 5.3 +/- 10 cm (medial), and 15.8 +/- 4.2 degrees (external), respectively, at the time of fixator removal; and this correction was maintained during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean total tibial lengthening was 6.84 +/- 1.3 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average healing index was 26.06 days/cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complications observed were 15 pin tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, 1 residual varus, 1 overcorrection into valgus, 2 recurrence of varus, 22 equinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo>, 2 premature consolidations, and 3 fibula malalignments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of varus was observed in limbs with a residual abnormal medial mechanical axis deviation due to femoral deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A hundred percent incidence of equinus was observed in limbs with tibial lengthening of more than 40%, with distal tibial lengthening of more than 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To minimize the risk for occurrence of equinus, we recommend restriction of distal tibial lengthening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> to less than 15%, although total tibial lengthening may exceed 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fibula malalignment was not observed after double fibula osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This procedure is safe and efficacious if performed with strict adherence to prescribed technique </plain></SENT>
