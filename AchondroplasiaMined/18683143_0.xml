<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight fetuses affected by short-<z:mp ids='MP_0002109'>limb dysplasias</z:mp> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Umbilical blood sampling was employed to obtain fetal blood for karyotyping and FGFR3 gene detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted, and the exon 10 of the FGFR3 gene was amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCR amplicons were analyzed by DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism with Bfm I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FGFR3 exon 10 from the parents of the positive fetuses was screened by the same method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 78 fetuses affected with short-<z:mp ids='MP_0002109'>limb dysplasias</z:mp>, 8 cases had G1138A heterozygotic mutation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, and were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 70 fetuses had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nucleotide at nucleotide 1138 in exon 10 of FGFR3, therefore were excluded from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one father in parents of the 8 achondroplasia fetuses also had the G1138A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> could be diagnosed prenatally in the fetuses affected with short-<z:mp ids='MP_0002109'>limb dysplasias</z:mp> by using PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing of the exon 10 of the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
