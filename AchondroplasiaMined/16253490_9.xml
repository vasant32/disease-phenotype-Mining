<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in this receptor lead to various human growth disorders, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e>, disproportionately <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo>, characterized by narrowing of the hypertrophic region of the epiphyseal growth plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we find that FGF9, a preferred ligand for FGFR3 rapidly induces the upregulation and secretion of the matrix resident phosphoprotein, osteopontin (OPN) in cultured chicken chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect was observed as early as two hours post stimulation and at FGF9 concentrations as low as 1.25 ng/ml at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OPN expression is known to be associated with chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and osteoclast activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, FGF9 induced OPN was accompanied by inhibition of differentiation and increased proliferation of the treated chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FGF9 stimulated OPN expression irrespective of the differentiation stage of the cells or culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization analysis of epiphyseal growth plates from chicken or mice homozygous for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e>, G369C/mFGFR3 mutation demonstrated co-localization of OPN expression and osteoclast activity, as evidenced by tartarate resistant acid phosphatase positive cells in the osteochondral junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that FGF signaling directly activates OPN expression independent of chondrocytes differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may enhance the recruitment and activation of osteoclasts, and increase in cartilage resorption and remodeling in the chondro-osseus border </plain></SENT>
