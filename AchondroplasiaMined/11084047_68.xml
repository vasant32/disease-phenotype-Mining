<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in type 3 repeats of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) cause two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (MED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We expressed recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP that showed structural and functional properties identical to COMP isolated from cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fragment encompassing the eight type 3 repeats binds 14 calcium ions with moderate affinity and high cooperativity and presumably forms one large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-bonded folding unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A recombinant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> mutant COMP in which Asp-469 was deleted (D469 Delta) and a MED mutant COMP in which Asp-361 was substituted by Tyr (D361Y) were both secreted into the cell culture medium of human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed only small changes in the secondary structures of D469 Delta and D361Y, demonstrating that the mutations do not dramatically affect the folding and stability of COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the local conformations of the type 3 repeats were disturbed, and the number of bound <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> was reduced to 10 and 8, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to collagen I and II, collagen IX also binds to COMP with high affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and MED mutations reduce the binding to collagens I, II, and IX and result in an altered zinc dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These interactions may contribute to the development of the patient phenotypes and may explain why MED can also be caused by mutations in collagen IX genes </plain></SENT>
