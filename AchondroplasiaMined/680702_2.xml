<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 3 of them died and 5 emigrated, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> is about 3% in the island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 inbred brothers with <z:mp ids='MP_0002544'>brachydactyly</z:mp> of the index fingers and 1 case of '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>' were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the population structure of the island suggests that its high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> may have been produced by random drift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The index of isolation of its present population is roughly 17--27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genealogical, clinical and histological data are presented and anslyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Natural selection is not acting against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> gene at a measurable rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic investigations among <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albinos</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> did not reveal any difference as regards frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp>, association of acrocentrics and chromatid gaps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The role of random processes in evolution is mentioned and the possibility that they may be more important than it is sometimes assumed is stressed </plain></SENT>
