<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The varus deformity is more common than the valgus deformity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and hypochondroplasia patients because of the unusual growth of the fibulae than that of the tibiae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed six patients (four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and two patients with hypochondroplsia) with relevant limb deformities due to the above-mentioned entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients manifested significant varus deformity of the lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detailed phenotypic characterization, radiologic and genetic testing was carried out as baseline diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We described the re-alignment procedures, which have been applied accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, bilateral multi-level procedures, multi-apical planning and limb lengthening have been successfully applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While recognition of the underlying syndromic association in patients who are manifesting angular deformities is the baseline for proper orthopaedic management, this paper demonstrates how to evaluate and treat these complex patients </plain></SENT>
