<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> has recently been shown to result from a Gly to Arg substitution in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), although the molecular consequences of this mutation have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By substituting the transmembrane domain of the Neu receptor tyrosine kinase with the transmembrane domains of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant FGFR3, the Arg380 mutation in FGFR3 is shown to activate both the kinase and transforming activities of this chimeric receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Residues with side chains capable of participating in hydrogen bond formation, including Glu, Asp, and to a lesser extent, Gln, His and Lys, were able to substitute for the activating Arg380 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Arg380 point mutation also causes ligand-independent stimulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR3 itself, and greatly increased constitutive levels of phosphotyrosine on the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the molecular basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is unregulated signal transduction through FGFR3, which may result in inappropriate cartilage growth plate differentiation and thus abnormal long bone development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> may be one of the number of cogenital disorders where constitutive activation of a member of the FGFR family leads to development abnormalities </plain></SENT>
