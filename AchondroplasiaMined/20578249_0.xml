<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of over-expression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and mutant COMP on early stages of chondrogenesis in chicken limb bud micromass cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were transduced with RCAS virus harboring <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> or mutant (C328R, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>; T585R, MED) COMP cDNAs and cultured for 3, 4, and 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of COMP constructs on chondrogenesis was assessed by analyzing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of several COMP binding partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cell viability was assayed, and evaluation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was performed by monitoring caspase 3 processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of COMP, and especially expression of COMP mutants, had a profound affect on the expression of syndecan 3 and tenascin C, early markers of chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over-expression of COMP did not affect levels of type II collagen or matrilin-3; however, there were increases in type IX collagen expression and sulfated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> synthesis, particularly at day 5 of harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to cells over-expressing COMP, cells with mutant COMP showed reduction in type IX collagen expression and increased matrilin 3 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, reduction in cell viability, and increased activity of caspase 3, at days 4 and 5, were observed in cultures expressing either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> or mutant COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MED, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> mutations, despite displaying phenotypic differences, demonstrated only subtle differences in their cellular viability and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression of components of the extracellular matrix, including those that interact with COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that COMP mutations, by disrupting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> interactions between COMP and its binding partners, significantly affect chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
