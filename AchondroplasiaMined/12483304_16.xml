<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 40 mutations have been identified; however, genotype-phenotype relationships are not well delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, mutations other than in-frame insertion/deletions and substitutions have not been found, and currently known mutations are clustered within relatively small regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report the identification of nine novel and three recurrent COMP mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and MED patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include two novel types of mutations; the first, a gross deletion spanning an exon-intron junction, causes an exon deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second, a frameshift mutation that results in a truncation of the C-terminal domain, is the first known truncating mutation in the COMP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining mutations, other than a novel exon 18 mutation, affected highly conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in the calmodulin-like repeat (CLR) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analysis revealed a correlation between the position and type of mutations and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the seventh CLR produced more <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> compared with mutations elsewhere in the CLRs ( P=0.0003) and elsewhere in the COMP gene ( P=0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients carrying mutations within the five-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartates</z:chebi> repeat (aa 469-473) in the seventh CLR were extremely short (below -6 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with deletion mutations were significantly shorter than those with substitution mutations ( P=0.0024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings expand the mutation spectrum of the COMP gene and highlight genotype-phenotype relationships, facilitating improved genetic diagnosis and analysis of COMP function in humans </plain></SENT>
