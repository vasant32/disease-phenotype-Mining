<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to explore the effects of purified insulin during early stages of chick embryo development, and to search for variations between different <z:chebi fb="22" ids="24431">molecular structures</z:chebi> of the hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chicken embryos were treated in ovo with a single dose of insulin (porcine or bovine), in only one stage of development between day 0 and day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two susceptible periods were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The earliest period (day 0 to day 3), characterized by abnormalities in the caudal vertebrae and a high mortality rate, was followed by a period with a different set of malformations, a syndrome classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of achondroplastic embryos was significantly higher with porcine rather than with bovine insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, insulin at physiological doses has stimulatory effects in growth and development but, in contrast, has inhibitory effects at higher doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The precise signalling cascade of events in the target cells is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible interpretations of our results are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The similarity between the insulin-induced abnormalities in the chicken embryos and the caudal regression syndrome, the most common malformation found in infants of diabetic women, suggests a common mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This circumstance offers the chicken embryos as an excellent in vivo model for research on the mechanism of action of insulin during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal development </plain></SENT>
