<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is a hereditary form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> caused by a defect in endochondral bone formation, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, shortened limb bones, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002773'>small vertebral bodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the pediatric population, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> occurs at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> spinal levels due to the abnormally narrow bone canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, clinical outcomes were assessed in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> after spinal canal decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted involving pediatric patients with heterozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and symptomatic stenosis after decompressive procedures at the authors' institution within a 9-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measured outcomes included resolution of symptoms, need for repeated surgery, presence of fusion, development of deformity, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-four pediatric patients underwent a total of 60 decompressive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average patient age at surgery was 12.7 years (range 5-21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine operations were performed for initial treatment of stenosis, and 11 were performed as revision surgeries on previously operated levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of patients (&gt; 60%) required additional cervicomedullary decompressions, most often preceding the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the initial procedures, decompression locations included 32 thoracolumbar (65%), 10 lumbar (20%), four cervical (8%), two cervicothoracic (4%), and one thoracic (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forty-three of the decompressive procedures (72%) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 revisions, five were fusion procedures for progressive deformity at levels previously decompressed but not fused (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> thoracolumbar), five were for decompressions of symptomatic junctional stenosis with extension of fusion, and one was for repeated decompression at the same level due to recurrence of symptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decompression of the spinal canal in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> can be accomplished safely with significant clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of cervicomedullary compression may be at an increased risk of developing symptomatic stenosis prior to adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fusion procedures are recommended in patients with a large decompression overlying a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> to avoid progressive postoperative deformity </plain></SENT>
