<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four children with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteochondrodysplasias</z:e> were evaluated by ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variation in the configuration of the acetabulum included a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003180'>horizontal acetabular roof</z:hpo> owing to delayed iliac development and a notched acetabular roof with lateral bone deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had thickened acetabular cartilage except for one child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002812'>Coxa vara</z:hpo> was a common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> neonates displayed a very small beta angle (mean, 42 degrees) because the labrum lay more vertically, secondary to deep engagement of the femoral head in the acetabulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal femoral ossification was delayed in most children, which allows use of ultrasonography at a later age than is possible in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hip ultrasonography in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> can aid in early diagnosis and is useful in assessing hip <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and development </plain></SENT>
