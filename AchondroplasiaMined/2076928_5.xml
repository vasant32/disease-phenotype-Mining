<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used Ilazorov's method of distraction epiphyseolysis for leg lengthening since 1977 and his new method of corticotomy or compactotomy since 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first method was carried out in 22 lower limbs with an average lengthening of 8.25 cm (range 4 to 18 cm); included in this group are 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in whom both legs were lengthened 12 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second method, a corticotomy is carried out at the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction followed by distraction in Ilazorov's apparatus (4 x 0.25 mm a day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We lengthened 30 legs; included are 5 patients who had both legs lengthened from between 8 and 12 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remainder an average of 7.9 cm of lengthening was achieved (range from 4 to 15 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The index for the treatment time per cm achieved (time from operation until full weight-bearing per cm of lengthening) was shorter after distraction epiphyseolysis than after corticotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications were also a little less after the latter procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distraction epiphyseolysis has to be limited to children from aged 12 years until growth ceases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The advantage with corticotomy is that it can be done at any age from 5 to 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Care is needed in both cases to avoid complications </plain></SENT>
