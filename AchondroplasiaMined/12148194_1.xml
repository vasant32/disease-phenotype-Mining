<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age at the beginning of treatment ranged from 6 to 29 years (mean 13.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in 19 patients was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e>, in next 2--other bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other 5 patients had not bone pathology and were treated because of cosmetic indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative body height ranged from 90 to 149 cm (mean 120) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Axial deviations of the lower extremities were noted in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 3.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHOD OF TREATMENT: Most of patients were treated with Ilizarov device using cross lengthening strategy (2 stages--opposite femur and tibia lengthening) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean duration of treatment including interval between two stages (mean 12 months) was 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Planned increase of body height ranged from 10 to 26 cm (mean 16.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Planned or greater lengthening (mean 14.8 cm) was achieved in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Partial planned lengthening (mean 65% of planned lengthening) was achieved in 8 patients (mean 11.8 cm) including two patients who resigned the second stage of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In two patients lengthening was stopped during first month of treatment because of great complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients treatment was not completed (interval between first and second stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean increase of body height of patients with complete treatment was 13.1 cm (from 2 to 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Problems, obstacles and complications were analyzed according to Paley classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>PROBLEMS: There were 24 problems in 15 patient (<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> process around K wires--15 patients, bone healing disturbances--3, regenerate fracture--2, transient foot equinus--2 and axial deviation of the lower extremity--1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>OBSTACLES: There were 31 obstacles in 19 patients (regenerate's defect--7 patients, premature bone consolidation--6, foot equinus--4 and other--14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>COMPLICATIONS: There were 26 complications in 18 patients (axial deviation of the lengthened segment--8, foot equinus--6, <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the peroneal nerve--3, fractures--2 and other--5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The most serious complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (1 patient) and damaging of the femoral artery (1 patient) both disrupting bone lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The risk of complication in surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> patients is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Qualification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> treatment because of cosmetic indication should be made very careful and after precise psychological and/or psychiatric investigation </plain></SENT>
