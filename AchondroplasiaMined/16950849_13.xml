<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the molecular mechanism of pathology induction is under debate, the structural consequences of the mutation have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we use neutron diffraction to determine the disposition of FGFR3 transmembrane domain in fluid <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayers, and investigate whether the G380R mutation affects the topology of the protein in the bilayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that, in a model system, the G380R mutation induces a shift in the segment that is embedded in the membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The center of the <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> core-embedded segment in the mutant is close to the midpoint between R380 and R397, supporting previous measurements of arginine insertion energetics into the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presented results further our knowledge about basic amino-acid insertion into bilayers, and may lead to new insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
