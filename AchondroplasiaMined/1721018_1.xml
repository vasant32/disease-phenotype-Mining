<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent data from the literature have shown that cDNA clones for the carboxyterminal domain of the core protein of large <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> monomers from human cartilage contain an EGF-like domain, which appears to undergo alternative splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have found that articular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> from human and baboon separated on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> flat-bed gels and blotted onto <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> react with a rabbit antiserum to mouse EGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition both forms of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> (band I and band II) seen on these gels are reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reactivity is seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> extracted from human articular cartilage of various ages (fetal, newborn, young and aged) and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> extracted from cartilage of thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and homozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactivity is dependent on prior digestion of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53325">nitrocellulose</z:chebi> blot with Chase ABC, suggesting masking of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity of the EGF antiserum with cartilage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> core protein was also demonstrated in an ELISA system with core protein as coating antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reactivity appears to reside in a tryptic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> generated from Chase/keratanase digested core protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactive species migrates as a 68 KDa species on gradient gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunological detection and quantitative analysis of the EGF-like domain could be useful for analysis of various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> samples </plain></SENT>
