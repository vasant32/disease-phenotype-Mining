<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiologic and surgical findings were correlated to establish the causes of achondroplastic spinal restenosis and the benefits of its therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (five men, three women) with spinal restenotic complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common neurological sign of recurrent stenosis was impaired motor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean interval between the most recent surgeries was 8.2 years (9.5 years for surgeries at the same levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common causes of recurrent stenosis were facet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and disk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The complications were a dural tear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo> in one patient and transient neurological deterioration in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Restenosis can occur many years after original decompression in the achondroplastic spine, and repeated operation can successfully lessen pain and neurological symptoms in most patients </plain></SENT>
