<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epiphyseal growth plates of affected individuals are disorganized and hypocellular and show aberrant chondrocyte maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the molecular basis of these abnormalities, we used a chondrocytic cell line, CFK2, to stably express the b variant of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FGFR3 or the the constitutively active FGFR3Ach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of FGFR3 had minimal effects on CFK2 proliferation and maturation compared with the severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> found in cells expressing FGFR3Ach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing the mutant receptor also showed an abnormal apoptotic response to serum deprivation and failed to undergo differentiation under appropriate culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with altered expression of integrin subunits, which effectively led to a switch in substrate preference of the immature cell from fibronectin to type II collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These in vitro observations support those from in vivo studies indicating that FGFR3 mediates an inhibitory influence on chondrocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We now suggest that the mechanism is related to altered integrin expression </plain></SENT>
