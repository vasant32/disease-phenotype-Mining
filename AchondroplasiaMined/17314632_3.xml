<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this condition rarely develops before the age of 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current study was to identify anatomical factors and clinical symptoms associated with early presentation of lumbar stenosis in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The charts of 22 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004610'>lumbar spinal stenosis</z:hpo> requiring surgery (subjects) were reviewed retrospectively, focusing on clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and radiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings were compared with those of a group of patients who had not developed stenotic symptoms (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis was performed using chi2 test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significance was set at P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared radiographically with controls, the subjects had a significantly larger average percentage decrease in the transverse interpedicular distance from T12 to L5 (-8% vs -19%, respectively) and a significantly greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> angle (24.2-degree angle vs 14.1-degree angle, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These features were associated with an increased likelihood of developing symptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The study indicated that 6 patients (32%) of the control group had caudal widening of the lumbar spine from T12 to L5 </plain></SENT>
