<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here is reported a technique of valgus proximal tibial osteotomy, of the incomplete closing wedge type, that has avoided neurovascular compromise while achieving reliable correction and rapid bony union </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oblique proximal tibial valgus osteotomies with lateral tension plate fixation were performed on 18 tibiae in 14 patients (age range, 5-25 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175756" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tibia vara</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary diagnosis was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175756" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Blount's disease</z:e> in 13 tibiae, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in 2 tibiae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> in 2 tibiae, and hypochondroplasia in 1 tibia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No postoperative plaster immobilization was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were able to bear weight fully by 8 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average angular correction was 18 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had overcorrection because of an unrecognized intraoperative fracture of the media] tibial cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no neurovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No growth disturbance of the proximal tibial physis was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Oblique proximal tibial osteotomy with tension plate fixation successfully corrected varus deformity of the proximal tibia in the growing patient without damage to the proximal tibial physis or neurovascular compromise </plain></SENT>
