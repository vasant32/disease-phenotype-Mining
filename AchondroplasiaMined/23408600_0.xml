<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To improve the prenatal diagnosis of thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> by defining the change in fetal size across gestation and the frequency of sonographic features, and developing non-invasive molecular genetic diagnosis based on cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fetuses with a confirmed diagnosis of thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> were ascertained, records reviewed, sonographic features and measurements determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Charts of fetal size were then constructed using the LMS (lambda-mu-sigma) method and compared with charts used in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies and those complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases in this cohort referred to our Regional Genetics Laboratory for molecular diagnosis using cffDNA were identified and results reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-two cases were scanned in our units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Commonly reported sonographic features were very short and sometimes bowed femora, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009803'>short fingers</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005257'>small chest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005753'>Limb shortening</z:hpo> was obvious from as early as 13 weeks' gestation, with minimal growth after 20 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cffDNA in three of these pregnancies confirmed the presence of the c.742C&gt;CT (p.Arg248Cys) or the c.1948A&gt;AG (p.Lys650Glu) mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data should improve the accuracy of the sonographic diagnosis of thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and have implications for reliable and safe targeted molecular confirmation using cffDNA. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd </plain></SENT>
