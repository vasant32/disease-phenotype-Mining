<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the agent in doses used to treat non-GH-deficient forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> (0.3 mg/kg/wk) modestly increases overall height velocity in some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect was seen mainly in children with the lowest growth velocities prior to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No untoward effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several questions were raised that require further study </plain></SENT>
