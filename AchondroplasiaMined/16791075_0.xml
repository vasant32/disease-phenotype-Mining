<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective review of 11 children (12 limbs) who underwent limb lengthenings of the same bone twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 7 femoral and 5 tibial repeated lengthenings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included congenital femoral deficiency or proximal femoral focal deficiency in 6 patients, fibular <z:mp ids='MP_0008985'>hemimelia</z:mp> in 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in 2, and tibial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 8.5 years for the first lengthening and 11.5 years for the second lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 2.2 complications per lengthening for the first procedure and 1.5 for the second lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 5 major and 22 minor complications for the first lengthening and 1 major and 17 minor complications for the second lengthening, none of these data were found to be statistically different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The healing index was 1.3 +/- 0.43 months per cm first lengthening and 2.2 +/- 1.7 cm for the second lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study did not demonstrate a significantly higher rate of complications with repeated lengthening of the same limb, although the time in the fixator for the second lengthening was longer and the degree of lengthening less </plain></SENT>
