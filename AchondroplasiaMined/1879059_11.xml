<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hypochondroplasia, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and usually mild form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodystrophy</z:mp>, is a common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It often goes unrecognized in childhood and is diagnosed in adult life when <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> becomes obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed restriction enzyme analysis of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene on the families of 20 white British Caucasian children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> attributed to hypochondroplasia by radiological and clinical criteria, who were undergoing human growth hormone (r-hGH) treatment, in 60 children with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000824'>growth hormone deficiency</z:hpo> and in 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the heterozygous pattern (Hind III: 8.2, 5.2, 4.8, 3.2 kb fragments, Pvu: 8.4, 5.1, 4.7, 2.5 kb fragments) in children with hypochondroplasia was significantly higher (chi2: P less than 0.05) than in the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypochondroplastic children whose response to r-hGH treatment was characterized by a proportionate increase in both spinal and subischial leg length were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heterozygous for two co-inherited IGF-I gene restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) alleles (Hind III: 5.2, 4.8 kb; Pvu II: 5.1, 4.7 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children whose response was characterized by accentuation of the body disproportion by r-hGH treatment were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> homozygous for these alleles (Hind III: 4.8, 4.8 kb; Pvu II: 4.7, 4.7 kb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their response to r-hGH treatment is significantly different (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Studies of the families of the heterozygous affected children demonstrated strong linkage (lod score 3.311 at zero recombination) of the IGF-I gene locus at chromosome 12q23 to this subgroup of hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5.2 kb Hind III and 5.1 kb Pvu II alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium with this trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that IGF-I gene may be a candidate gene for involvement in the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> presenting with hypochondroplastic features and a proportionate response to r-hGH treatment; they also provide support for the concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodystrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
