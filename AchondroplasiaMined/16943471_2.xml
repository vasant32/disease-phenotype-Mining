<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the sagittal canal diameter, the sagittal cord diameter, the interpedicular distance at the mid-pedicle level and the cross-sectional area of the canal and spinal cord at mid-body and mid-disc levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MRI findings showed that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> there was a significant difference between the groups in the cross-sectional area of the body canal at the upper lumbar levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a narrower canal are more likely to develop symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> than others </plain></SENT>
