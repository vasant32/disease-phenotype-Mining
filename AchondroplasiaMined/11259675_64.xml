<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> family consists of three structurally related endogenous ligands, atrial, brain, and C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> (ANP, BNP, and CNP), and is thought to be involved in a variety of homeostatic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the physiological significance of CNP in vivo, we generated mice with targeted disruption of CNP (Nppc(-/-) mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Nppc(-/-) mice show severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> as a result of impaired endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> viable perinatally, but less than half can survive during postnatal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The skeletal phenotypes are histologically similar to those seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common genetic form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeted expression of CNP in the growth plate chondrocytes can rescue the skeletal defect of Nppc(-/-) mice and allow their prolonged survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that CNP acts locally as a positive regulator of endochondral ossification in vivo and suggests its pathophysiological and therapeutic implication in some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
