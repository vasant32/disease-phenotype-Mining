<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Earlier descriptions reported severe disturbance of enchondral ossification to be typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>: They are, however, misleading by dealing mostly with cases of lethal neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> (e.g. thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newer findings confirmed that only minor, quantitative lesions are typical of heterozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But even in recent years some observers noted more severe changes of enchondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An extensive histologic skeletal survey in a newborn achondroplastic male revealed remarkable findings: It clearly showed that in addition to a generalized, but moderate narrowing of the zones of enchondral ossification focal severe changes were present in various epiphyseal plates including clusterlike arrangement of enlarged chondrocytes, vacuolization, premature calcification and important <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of cartilagineous matrix with membranous ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings thus enable us to reconcile the seemingly divergent statements made before </plain></SENT>
