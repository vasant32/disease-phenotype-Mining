<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we compared the ubiquitylation of either <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> or a K508A 'kinase-dead' mutant of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) with that of its naturally occurring overactive mutants, G380R as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, or K650E involved in thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor receptors ubiquitylation was found to be directly proportional to their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, both of which could be blocked using kinase inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite excessive ubiquitylation, both overactive mutants failed to be efficiently degraded, even when challenged with ligand or overexpression of c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>, a putative E3 ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that phosphorylation is essential for FGFR3 ubiquitylation, but is not sufficient to induce downregulation of its internalization resistant mutants </plain></SENT>
