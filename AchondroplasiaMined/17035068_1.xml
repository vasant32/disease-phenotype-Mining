<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Osteonectin is a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that modulates several aspects of cellular behaviour including proliferation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium forms a continuous monolayer of polarised cells immediately bellow the neuroretina, and is integral to the homeostasis of photoreceptor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While osteonectin is expressed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium in situ, its expression is significantly increased in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelial cells associated with several common <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pattern of expression implies an important role for osteonectin in the biology of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the trafficking, processing, and eventual fate of osteonectin in these cells is not clear at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the theoretical report of a leader sequence within the osteonectin open reading frame and its extracellular presence in some tissues indirectly support secretion of the protein, there is no direct experimental demonstration of the secretion route to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a first step towards understanding the role of osteonectin in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium, we studied the intracellular distribution and trafficking of the protein in living cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we present experimental evidence that a precursor osteonectin fusion protein is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway, with a likely basal secretion in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we show that the precursor osteonectin protein having the leader sequence masked fails to undergo secretion leading to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, a phenotype which may be of relevance not only for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pathology, but also for other diseases such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005940" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone disorder</z:e> known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> that is associated with a lack of osteonectin secretion </plain></SENT>
