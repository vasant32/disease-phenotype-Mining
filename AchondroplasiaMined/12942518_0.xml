<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the floor of the mouth with mandibular spread and subsequent segmentary mandibular removal are the cornerstone examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the whole floor of the mouth with mandibular invasion is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radical resection of the floor of the mouth and bilateral mandibular horizontal ramus was performed, with a bony defect extending from angle to angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient revealed an achondroplastic condition, with remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> and long-bone morphological alterations, that minimized the potential fibular length to transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A microsurgical reconstruction with an osteocutaneous fibular free flap was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The flap design was technically compromised by the forward bowing of the fibula and the ossification of the interosseous membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specific intraoperative strategies for dealing with anatomic variations are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fibular free flap is an excellent technique for mandibular reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morphological deviations can modify the design of the flap </plain></SENT>
