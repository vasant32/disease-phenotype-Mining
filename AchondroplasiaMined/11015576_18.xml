<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Specific mutations in the FGFR3 gene are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> such as hypochondroplasia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>), the mildest form of this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo> disorders, results in approximately 60% of cases from a mutation in the intracellular FGFR3-tyrosine kinase domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases may either be caused by defects in other FGFR gene regions or other yet unidentified genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> mutation, the first found outside the common mutation hot spot of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This point mutation, an N328I exchange in the extracellular Ig domain III of the receptor, seems to be unique as it affects a putative N-glycosylation site that is conserved between different FGFRs and species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amino acid exchange itself most probably has no impact on the three-dimensional structure of the receptor domain, suggesting that the phenotype is the result of altered receptor glycosylation and its pathophysiological consequences </plain></SENT>
