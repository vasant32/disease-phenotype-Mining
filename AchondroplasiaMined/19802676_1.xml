<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cellular mechanisms involved in the reduced growth have been mainly described for in vitro or in vivo models, but few data have been obtained for humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen children with ACH were enrolled in the study; the presence of FGFR3 mutations was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing, whereas protein expression in cartilage biopsy was assessed by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Chondrocytes in cartilage biopsies of ACH children were characterized by the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> mediated by STAT activation (both STAT1 and STAT5) and increased expression of p21 and cyclin D1, whereas no expression of either p53 or cyclin D3 could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This mechanism was present in ACH children carrying the G380R mutation but also in a patient in whom no mutation could be detected in the entire coding region of the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data thus demonstrate the presence of a common final mechanism involving p21 and possibly leading to a block in chondrocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
