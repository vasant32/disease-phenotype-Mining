<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, seven boys (4.8-12.2 years of age) and 12 girls (5.7-2.2 years of age), were treated daily with hGH at a dosage of 1 IU/kg/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Auxological assessments were performed 6 months before, at initiation of, and at 6, 12, and 24 months following initiation of growth hormone (GH) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before initiating GH therapy, hypothalamic-pituitary and thyroid functions were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF binding protein (BP)-3 (IGFBP-3) were assessed, as was GH response to provocative stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GH responses in two stimulation tests were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the first semester of GH treatment, a significant increase in height velocity (HV), from 3.2 to 8.3 cm/year, was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, during the second semester, a relative decrease in growth rate was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By the end of the first year, HV had increased from 3.2 to 6.9 cm/year (mean, 3.7 cm/year; range, 1.1-8 cm/year) in 13 children and remained unchanged in two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HV declined progressively during the next 12 months and, by the end of the second year of treatment, had increased in seven of the nine children who had completed 2 years of therapy (mean increase, 3.1 cm/year); two children did not respond to GH therapy, as shown by the lack of increase in HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sitting-height (SH) to standing-height ratio % (SH%) remained unchanged throughout GH therapy, and no significant change in skeletal maturation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, hGH treatment resulted in an <z:mp ids='MP_0002865'>increased growth rate</z:mp> in some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>; however, this increase waned during the second year of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Children with the lowest pretreatment HVs seemed to benefit most from GH therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the usefulness of GH treatment in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> will be known only when a study of final height is completed </plain></SENT>
