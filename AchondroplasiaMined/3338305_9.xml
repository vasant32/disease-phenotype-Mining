<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, chest diameters and expiratory spirograms were measured in 58 female and 44 male subjects between 7 and 60 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standing height in adults was 49.6 +/- 3.2 (SD) inches with a sitting/standing height ratio of 0.66 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 0.52-0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, only AP chest diameters in males were smaller than control subjects of similar age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following equations were derived for forced vital capacity (FVC): males (under 25 years), FVC(L) = -3.56 + 0.162 X sitting height (in) + 0.067 X age (yrs); males (over 25 years), FVC(L) = -0.73 + 0.162 X sitting height (in) -0.047 X age (yrs); females (under 20 years), FVC(L) = -3.56 + 0.150 X sitting height (in) + 0.067 X age (yrs); females (over 20 years), FVC(L) = -1.92 + 0.150 X sitting height (in) -0.016 X age (years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar prediction equations were derived for FEV1 and FEF25-75%: FEV1/FVC % was 84.2 (+/- 6.5) for females and 88.0 (+/- 6.5) for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also compared the observed FVC measurements to values calculated using standing heights derived from the subject's sitting height, assuming a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body proportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed vital capacity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was only 67.6 (+/- 19.2) percent of that predicted for normally proportioned females and 72.4 (+/- 13.6) percent for males, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002792'>reduced vital capacity</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, due to reduced chest wall compliance or abnormal lung growth </plain></SENT>
