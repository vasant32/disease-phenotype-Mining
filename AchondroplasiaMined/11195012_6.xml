<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the diagnostic properties of MRI of the brain and spine in achondroplastic children with regard to decompressive surgery, 25 patients were examined by conventional morphological and by "functional" imaging of CSF flow and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the veins and sinuses at the cranial base following a special protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to those from age-matched controls and were correlated with each other and retrospectively with the neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measurements of distances and angulations at the cranio-cervical junction (CCJ) from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans showed similar values to those from conventional radiographs and CTs and thus can be used without correction for spatial distorsion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signs of cervical medullary compression, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelomalacia</z:e> and intramedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation were found in six, seven and three children respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These alterations correlated significantly with each other (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semiquantitative evaluation of CSF flow demonstrated interruption of CSF pathways at the CCJ, which correlated with CCJ narrowing (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA showed a significant narrowing of the jugular foramina with a variable compensatory enlargement of the emissary veins and a significant reduction of the total outflow area (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant correlations between these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> changes and neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to this unexpectedly poor correlation between magnetic resonance and clinical findings in achondroplastic children, the present role of magnetic resonance in the clinical setting is limited to the demonstration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> in individual cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three of our patients with prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo>, the severe changes demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging strongly supported the indication for surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
