<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical screening program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: National convention of the Little People of America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Convenience sample of volunteers aged 18 years or younger with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Hearing screening with behavioral testing and/or otoacoustic emissions, otoscopy, and tympanometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A failed hearing screen was defined as hearing 35 dB <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> (hearing level) or greater at 1 or more tested frequencies or by a "fail" otoacoustic emissions response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Types B and C tympanograms were considered abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 58 children (aged ≤18 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> enrolled, and 56 completed hearing screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-one children had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing (71%); 9 failed in 1 ear (16%); and 6 failed in both ears (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-four children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and 31 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourteen children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss and middle-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e> are both highly prevalent in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Abnormal tympanometry is highly associated with the presence of hearing loss, as expected in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271468" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eustachian tube dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hearing screening with medical intervention is recommended for these children </plain></SENT>
