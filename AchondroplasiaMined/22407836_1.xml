<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a study based on more than 1.5 million births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> cases were detected from 1,544,496 births occurring and examined in 132 hospitals of ECLAMC (Latin American Collaborative Study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Congenital Malformations</z:e>) between 2000 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were detected and registered according to a pre-established protocol, and then ranked in four diagnostic evidence levels (DEL), according to available documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the analysis of risk factors, a healthy control sample born in the same period was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> was diagnosed in 492 newborns, resulting in a prevalence per 10,000 of 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis was made in 73% of cases (n = 359) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 211 cases from the best documented group (DEL-1) and according to international classification, 33% of cases fit into the G-25 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>), 29% in Group-1 (FGFR3), and 8% in Group-18 (Bent bones) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the main <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OCD</z:e> types were: OI-0.74 (0.61-0.89); thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>-0.47 (0.36-0.59); and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-0.44 (0.33-0.55) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study also confirmed the high perinatal mortality, and the association with high paternal age, parity, and parental consanguinity rate </plain></SENT>
