<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Centiles were calculated by LMS, a method for summarizing growth data which adjusts for skewness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Curves for centiles are obtained using the formula: [Formula: see text], where Z (α) is the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> equivalent deviate for tail area α; C100α is the weight or height centile corresponding to Z (α), t is age in years, and L(t) is (skewness)(t), M(t) is median, S (t) is coefficient variation and C(100α) (t) indicates the corresponding values of each curve at age t </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Boys and girls centiles for height were similar to USA references in infancy and childhood but lower than that references at adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Final height was 1.7 and 5.1 cm below USA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> references in girls and boys, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Head circumference centiles were, at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, lower than USA references in both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Countries need national references for clinical growth assessment of their local population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, specific local growth references for children with some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e> (such us <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) are valuable tools for detecting additional conditions affecting growth, for estimating final height and for evaluating the impact of growth-promoting treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: references presented here can also be used in other countries with similar ethnographics characteristics </plain></SENT>
