<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A 66-year-old achondroplastic male dwarf with right ureteral stones presented for outpatient extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy under epidural anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient had marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the epidural space was located easily at the L2-3 interspace on the first attempt, the catheter could not be advanced beyond the Tuohy needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the second attempt, the epidural space was located easily at the L1-2 interspace, and the catheter was advanced without difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A sensory block to the T2 level developed after administration of 2 mL of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 1.5% with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> 1:200,000 and 9 mL of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> 2.0% with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> 1:200,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aside from a short period of mild, asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, the patient's intraoperative and postoperative courses were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case report and the available literature support the feasibility of epidural anesthesia in achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Careful titration of the <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi> dose is recommended since achondroplastic patients may have extensive spread of epidural anesthesia </plain></SENT>
