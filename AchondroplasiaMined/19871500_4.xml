<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is the first instance of this abnormality in rodents to be reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The variation arose in pure bred Havana stock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The abnormality is determined by the expression of a simple recessive unit factor, affected individuals being homozygous for the factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Females are somewhat more frequently affected than males, but the character is not sex-linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rabbits heterozygous for the factor as determined by appropriate breeding tests have a perfectly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance at birth and in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The condition appears to be determined solely by the genetic constitution of the animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Attention was drawn to the fact that although the development of the achondroplastic form proceeds to birth at term, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> regularly occurs at the time of or very shortly after parturition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This feature of the condition is briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
