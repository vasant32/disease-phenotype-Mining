<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intraventricular pressure (IVP) was monitored over 24 hours, followed by intraventricular injection of radionuclide alone or in combination with water-soluble contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IVP was elevated and the reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the sagittal sinus was slow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but there was no obstruction to CSF flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spinal subarachnoid space was well seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Jugular venograms with pressure monitoring were obtained in four patients (bilaterally in one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies confirmed a narrow jugular foramen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with a significant venous pressure gradient (3 to 10 mm Hg) obtained while the catheter was being pulled back from the sigmoid sinus through the foramen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A second gradient was found in the jugular vein in two patients at the level of the upper thoracic aperture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This gradient was 6 and 14 mm Hg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identical venograms and monitoring of the venous pressure in a control group showed no pressure gradients across the jugular foramen and smaller gradients (2 to 5 mm Hg) across the thoracic inlet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded from these studies that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> in achondroplastic children represents <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, which is likely secondary to raised intracranial venous pressure due to hemodynamically significant stenosis of the jugular foramen and, in some cases, the jugular vein in the thoracic aperture </plain></SENT>
