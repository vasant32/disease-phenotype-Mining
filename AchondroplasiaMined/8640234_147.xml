<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>Dwarfism</z:hpo> results when this process is disrupted, as in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> human skeletal diseases hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these disorders display a graded spectrum of phenotypic severity and are the result of distinct missense mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TD, characterized by <z:mp ids='MP_0002058'>neonatal lethality</z:mp> and profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, is the result of FGFR3 mutations, including an R248C substitution in the extracellular domain or a K650E substitution in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ACH, which is non-lethal and presents less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, results almost exclusively from a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> resembles the phenotype of TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this report the effect of the ACH and TD mutations on the activity and regulation of FGFR3 are analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We showed that each of the mutations constitutively activate the receptor, as evidenced by ligand-independent receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mutations that are responsible for TD were more strongly activating than the mutation causing ACH, providing a biochemical explanation for the observation that the phenotype of TD is more severe than that of ACH </plain></SENT>
