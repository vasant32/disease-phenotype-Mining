<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> are thought to be caused by mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> FGFR3 hyperactivation and inhibition of bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One such disorder, thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, is associated frequently with cysteine substitutions (G370C, S371C, and Y373C) in the extracellular juxtamembrane region of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations have been suggested to induce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi>-mediated receptor dimerization and constitutive activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An adjacent cysteine substitution (G375C) leads to a less severe form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, suggesting that the intensity of FGFR3 activation by these cross-links may be position dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we have sequentially replaced each amino acid at positions 370-375 of FGFR3 with cysteine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of each of these mutant forms in 293T cells led to their spontaneous, ligand-independent dimerization and increased basal phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>Wild-type</z:mp> (WT) FGFR3 became dimerized and phosphorylated only on FGF stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the mutants, only two (G370C and S371C) caused high basal phosphorylation with significantly increased constitutive levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and c-fos transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This activity was probably caused by mutant homodimer pairs, because WT-mutant heterodimers were observed only in the presence, but not in the absence, of FGF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high spontaneous activity of the mutants in positions 370-371, unlike those in 372-375, affirms their known involvement with thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the G370C and S371C mutant receptors spontaneously dimerize in the correct spatial orientation required for effective signal transduction, whereas the 372-5 mutants, like the WT receptor, may achieve this orientation only on ligand binding </plain></SENT>
