<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reports of prenatal diagnosis of FGFR3 related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> are not rare; however, the correlation between 2nd trimester ultrasonographic findings and underlying molecular defect in these cases is relatively poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a need for specific ultrasound (U/S) predictors than can distinguish lethal from non-lethal cases and aid an earlier prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present one familial and 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases with FGFR3 related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, and we evaluate biometric parameters and U/S findings consistent with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>U/S scan performed even at the 18th week of gestation can indicate a decreased rate of development of the femora (femur length (FL) &lt;5th centile), while the mean gestational age at diagnosis is still around the 26th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The utility of other biometric parameters and ratios is discussed (foot length, BPD, HC, FL/foot, and FL/AC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prenatal cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A final diagnosis was reached by molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two cases of discontinued pregnancy, fetal autopsy led to a phenotypic diagnosis and confirmed the prenatal prediction of <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combination of U/S and molecular genetic approach is helpful for establishing an accurate diagnosis of FGFR3-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> in utero and subsequently for appropriate genetic counselling and perinatal management </plain></SENT>
