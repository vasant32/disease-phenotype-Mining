<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To relate <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of new bone formation to outcome after tibial lengthening performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 60 tibial segments in 30 achondroplasia patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 22 female patients and eight male patients, with a mean age of 9.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New bone formation was classified by shape, homogeneity and density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pixel values in relation to original bone were measured using a picture-archiving communication system (PACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was described by the external fixator and maturation indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean lengthening was 9.2 cm (range 3-12.7 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean external fixator index was 23.4 (range 15.1-50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean maturation index was 12.3 days/cm (range 6-40 days/cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Homogeneous pathways were associated with the best clinical results (fixator index 20.4, maturation index 10.8), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pathway (external fixator index 26.5, maturation index 16.8) and radiolucent pathway (fixator index 31.2, maturation index 21.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both cylindrical (external fixator index 25.2, maturation index 14.5) and concave (external fixator index 26.6, maturation index 16.3) callus shapes were favourable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mineralization of new bone became equal to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone within 16 weeks (mean) for homogeneous pathway, 12 weeks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> pathway and 32 weeks for lucent pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The type of new bone formation seen on radiographs is related to clinical outcome, with homogeneous pathways being the most favourable ones </plain></SENT>
