<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The severity and dysmorphology that results from the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures is not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less striking phenotypes may be more easily missed on routine screening, possibly leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare the age at initial presentation for the different forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent open craniofacial repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> at a single institution from 1996 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relationships between type of suture fusion and age at initial consultation were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred eleven patients (136 males, 75 females) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indications included sagittal (n = 96), metopic (n = 39), unicoronal (n = 33), bicoronal (n = 24), multisutural (n = 15), bilambdoidal (n = 3), and unilambdoidal (n = 1) synostoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (8.1%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndrome and 5 (2.4%) had a syndrome or disorder not typically associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> [<z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004912'>hypophosphatemic rickets</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (n = 1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith Wiedemann</z:e> (n = 1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median age at initial consultation was 4.1 months; there was no gender difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004912'>hypophosphatemic rickets</z:hpo> presented at a significantly older age than nonsyndromic patients or those with a known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those with multisutural <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> presented at a significantly older age than patients with sagittal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with multisutural involvement or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004912'>hypophosphatemic rickets</z:hpo> had a significant delay in presentation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The latter group of patients may especially benefit from routine surveillance for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> given their advanced age at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
