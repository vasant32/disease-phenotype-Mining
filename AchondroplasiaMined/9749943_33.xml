<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The importance of COMP is underscored by the finding that mutations in COMP cause the human dwarfing condition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the results of human tissue distribution and cell secretion studies of human COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>COMP is expressed and secreted by cultured monolayer chondrocyte, tendon and ligament cells, and COMP secretion is not restricted to a differentiated chondrocyte phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas COMP is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum that accumulates within <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocytes in vivo, COMP is not retained intracellularly in the dedifferentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocytes in cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results lend further support to the hypothesis that retention of COMP is related to the terminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocyte phenotype, processing of proteins related to extracellular matrix formation, and maintenance in cartilage </plain></SENT>
