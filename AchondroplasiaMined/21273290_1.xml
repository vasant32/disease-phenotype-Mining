<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> homeobox gene SHOX encodes a transcription factor which is important for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limb development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, SHOX deficiency has been associated with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> syndromes including Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD), Langer mesomelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> as well as non-syndromic idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A common feature of these syndromes is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> with a particular shortening of the forearms and lower legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our studies employing microarray analyses and cell culture experiments, we revealed a strong positive effect of SHOX on the expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene FGFR3, another well-known factor for limb development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Luciferase reporter gene assays show that SHOX activates the extended FGFR3 promoter, and results from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing, ChIP and electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments suggest a direct binding of SHOX to multiple upstream sequences of FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further investigate these regulations in a cellular system for limb development, the effect of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> overexpression of Shox in limb bud derived chicken micromass cultures was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that Fgfr3 was negatively regulated by Shox, as demonstrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This repressive effect might explain the almost mutually exclusive expression patterns of Fgfr3 and Shox in embryonic chicken limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A negative regulation that occurs mainly in the mesomelic segments, a region where SHOX is known to be strongly expressed, offers a possible explanation for the phenotypes seen in patients with FGFR3 (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) and SHOX defects (e.g. LWD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data present a link between two frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
