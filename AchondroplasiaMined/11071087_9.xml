<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amino acid substitutions Asn540Lys, Asn540Thr and Ile538Val in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) are considered to cause hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the FGFR3 gene for the previously described hypochondroplasia mutations and the phenotype of 23 probands with clinically and radiologically diagnosed hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the phenotype comparison, the patients were divided into two groups: Group 1: hypochondroplasia with Asn540Lys substitution; Group 2: hypochondroplasia with no mutations identified so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A three-generation family negative for the known hypochondroplasia mutations was examined with polymorphic markers flanking the FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine (39%) of 23 probands were found to be heterozygous for the Asn540Lys substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The individuals positive for the Asn540Lys substitution were significantly more disproportionate than the individuals without this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this respect, a genotype-phenotype correlation was found in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, some individuals belonging to the group without mutations identified so far showed similarly abnormal proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genotyping/haplotyping in the three-generation family with hypochondroplasia showed that FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes were not linked to the hypochondroplasia phenotype in this family, thus further confirming the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Individuals with hypochondroplasia heterozygous for the Asn540Lys substitution are significantly more disproportionate than individuals without this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our study further confirms the clinical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
