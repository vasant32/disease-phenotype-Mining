<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present case series aimed at assessing low bone density, diagnosed with spinal bone mineral density (BMD) analysis and with panoramic radiograph measurements, in ACH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spinal BMD was measured by means of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar region (L1-L4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On dental panoramic radiographs of the patients, the mandibular cortical width was measured separately on the right and left sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Klemetti Index was also assigned as appropriate for evaluating the cortical area below the mandibular foramen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional parameters such as patient age, gender, body mass index, and number of teeth were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BMD results showed that 5/11 cases presented with skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mandibular cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> was detected in panoramic radiographs in 8/11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BMD and panoramic radiographic alterations found in this study suggest that the diagnosis of low bone density may have a special clinical relevance in cases of bone <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949000" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tissue disorders</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
