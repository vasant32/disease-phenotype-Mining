<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had undergone three surgical procedures of thoracic expansion since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors utilized computer-generated lung volume histograms after spiral computed tomographic scanning and three-dimensional imaging of the lungs to calculate his lung volumes before and after the third surgical thoracic expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lung volumes, calculated by the histograms, were 363 mL and 406 mL before and after surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This 40-mL difference in the patient's lung volumes (4 mL/kg) accounted for a significant clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lung volume histograms obtained by this radiographic method are very helpful in substantiating a successful surgical chest expansion or provide an explanation for an unsuccessful repair </plain></SENT>
