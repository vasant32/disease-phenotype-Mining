<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene analysis of these patients showed a T341P mutation in the FGFR2 gene in the patient with Pfeiffer syndrome, and a G380R mutation in the FGFR3 gene in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
