<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty humeral lengthenings were done on 10 achondroplastic dwarfs using the Ilizarov circular fixator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were five female and five male patients from 6 years 11 months to 17 years 8 months of age (mean, 12 years 10 months) at the time of the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean length obtained was 7.8 cm (range, 3.5 cm-10 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>External fixation time ranged from 105 days to 368 days (mean, 221 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healing index averaged 30 days/cm (27 days/cm when two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radial nerve palsy</z:e> were excluded) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two half pins in one patient required replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two humeral fractures occurred, one while in the fixator and the other after removal of the apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radial nerve palsy</z:e> developed during lengthening in two patients, and lengthening was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radial nerve palsy</z:e> resolved completely in both patients, but one patient required an additional surgery to explore the radial nerve for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> of the forearm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although preexisting loose shoulders deteriorate during lengthening and sometimes cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pain and discomfort</z:e>, they always resolve spontaneously as lengthening proceeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral humeral lengthening was very effective for improving function and overall proportion in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
