<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main morphological characteristic of the affected growth cartilage is an underdeveloped hypertrophic zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of matrix mineralization seems to be unaffected, even in areas where hypertrophic chondrocytes are completely absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present stereological results indicate a disturbance of the cn/cn cartilage already in the proliferative zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the electron microscopical level a clearly abnormal spatial distribution of matrix vesicles was observed in the affected growth cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vesicle concentration of the cn/cn cartilage was increased, but the mineralizing cartilage showed a decrease of vesicles similar to that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Parallel biochemical characterization of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> of the cn/cn costal cartilage revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, also in the growth region, which was sampled as a separate tissue fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus the biochemical results provide no evidence of disturbed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycan</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
