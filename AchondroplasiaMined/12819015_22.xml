<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Familial mutations in type 3 repeats of COMP are known to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (EDM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although such mutations induce enlarged rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) as a morphological change, the metabolic trafficking of mutated COMP remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In transfected COS7 cells, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP was rapidly secreted into culture medium, while the great majority of COMP with the type 3 repeats mutation (D472Y) remained in the cells and a small portion of mutated COMP was secreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding was followed up with a confocal study with an antibody specific to COMP, which demonstrated mutated COMP tightly associated with abnormally enlarged rER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated eIF2alpha, an ER stress protein, was expressed as a pathological reaction in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> COS7 cells expressing mutated but not <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, COS7 cells expressing mutated COMP exhibited significantly more apoptotic reaction than those expressing <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological accumulation of COMP in rER and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in COS7 cells that were induced by the mutation (D472Y) in COMP imply that COMP mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
