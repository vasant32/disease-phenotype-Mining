<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unilateral external fixator was applied to the lateral aspect of the humerus with four half-pins and percutaneous predrilling osteotomy was performed at the apex of flexion deformity of the bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the waiting period before distraction, the flexion deformity of the distal humerus was corrected using an additional external fixator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slow gradual distraction was subsequently carried out at a rate of 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>25 mm every 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average lengthening was 8 cm (range 7.5 to 9 cm), the overall treatment time 312 days (range 192 to 406 days), and the average healing index 39.0 days/cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average correction of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002987'>elbow flexion deformity</z:hpo> was 20 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe this treatment is useful to improve the function of the arms and the activity of daily living for the patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0005792'>short humeri</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
