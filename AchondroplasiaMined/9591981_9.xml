<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0010301'>spinal dysraphism</z:hpo> (67), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (nine), isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo> (nine), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> (three), and others (seven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survivorship data were calculated for the initial and first-revision <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a 50% revision rate by 5 years after initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered-cord</z:hpo> release and a 57% revision rate by 2 years after a second release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients were excluded for having &lt;2 years of clinical follow-up, leaving 97 spinal cord releases in 52 patients available for outcome analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 4.4 years (range, 2-11.3), 58% of patients required one or more orthopedic procedures after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered-cord</z:hpo> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average number of orthopedic procedures per year before release (0.28/year) was found to increase after initial release (0.39/year; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate the frequent need for operative revision after index <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered-cord</z:hpo> release, especially in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010301'>spinal dysraphism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the need for orthopedic procedures after tethered spinal-cord release frequently persists </plain></SENT>
