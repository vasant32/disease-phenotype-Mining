<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are few effective treatments for ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the <z:mp ids='MP_0002058'>neonatal lethality</z:mp> of TD patients, no practical effective therapies are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We here showed that systemic intermittent PTH (1-34) injection can rescue the lethal phenotype of TD type II (TDII) mice and significantly alleviate the retarded skeleton development of ACH mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTH-treated ACH mice had longer naso-anal length than ACH control mice, and the bone lengths of humeri and tibiae were rescued to be comparable with those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study also found that the premature fusion of cranial synchondroses in ACH mice was partially corrected after the PTH (1-34) treatment, suggesting that the PTH treatment may rescue the progressive narrowing of neurocentral synchondroses that cannot be readily corrected by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that the PTH treatment can improve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> and bone structure of ACH mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased expression of PTHrP and down-regulated FGFR3 level may be responsible for the positive effects of PTH on bone phenotype of ACH and TDII mice </plain></SENT>
