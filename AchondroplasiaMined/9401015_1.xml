<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> have a G--&gt;A substitution at position 1138 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR3) cDNA sequence, resulting in the substitution of an arginine for a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29947">glycine residue</z:chebi> at position 380 of the FGFR3 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mutation has typically been detected by SfcI digestion of amplified genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that the SfcI digestion protocol does not consistently distinguish between DNA samples heterozygous and homozygous for the G1138A substitution, and illustrates how the misdiagnosis of a homozygous affected fetus for one carrying only one copy of the G1138A mutation could occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here an improved, simple nonradioactive technique which can reliably and consistently detect the presence of the G1138A mutation both in the heterozygous and homozygous state </plain></SENT>
