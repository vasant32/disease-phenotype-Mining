<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the complications of humeral lengthening with those of femoral lengthening and investigated whether or not the callus formation in the humerus proceeds at a higher rate than that in the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 humeral and 24 femoral lengthenings were performed on 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the pixel value ratio (PVR) of the lengthened area on radiographs and each radiograph was analysed for the shape, type and density of the callus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quality of life (QOL) of the patients after humeral lengthening was compared with that prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complication rate per segment of humerus and femur was 0.87% and 1.37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the humerus the PVR was significantly higher than that of the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower limbs were associated with an increased incidence of concave, lateral and central callus shapes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Humeral lengthening had a lower complication rate than lower-limb lengthening, and QOL increased significantly after humeral lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Callus formation in the humerus during the distraction period proceeded at a significantly higher rate than that in the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that humeral lengthening has an important role in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
