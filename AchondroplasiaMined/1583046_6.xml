<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an increase in chondrocytic vertical height is a major variable that accounts for the decreased rate of growth of long bones in Scottish deerhound dogs that had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> is based, primarily, on the demonstration of alternating electron-dense and electron-lucent lamellae with a periodicity of 100 to 150 nanometers in dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These ultrastructural changes are similar to those seen in humans who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Scottish deerhounds that have the disease, growth of bone is approximately 65 per cent of that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were striking differences in the diameters of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes in pseudoachondroplastic animals compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the horizontal diameter of proliferating chondrocytes was 22.7 micrometers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals and 11.3 micrometers in pseudoachondroplastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vertical diameter of proliferating chondrocytes was 4.8 and 7.6 micrometers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pseudoachondroplastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the distal 100 micrometers of the hypertrophic zone, the mean horizontal diameter of hypertrophic chondrocytes was 29.6 and 19.1 micrometers and the mean vertical diameter was 22.8 and 18.6 micrometers in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pseudoachondroplastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these differences were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The changes in vertical height resulted in a significant difference in the incremental difference in vertical height between chondrocytes from the proliferative and hypertrophic zones in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals (18.0 micrometers per chondrocyte) and pseudoachondroplastic animals (11.0 micrometers per chondrocyte) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Each chondrocyte in the abnormal plates achieved only 61 per cent of the incremental difference of chondrocytes in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean cellular volume of chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone was 13,050 cubic micrometers in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals and 10,740 cubic micrometers in the pseudoachondroplastic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in relation to current theories of the role of the shape and change in volume of chondrocytes in the regulation of longitudinal growth of bone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
