<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 50 unique COMP mutations have been identified as causing two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (EDM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that calcium-binding and calcium-induced protein folding differ between <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and mutant proteins, and abnormal processing of the mutant COMP protein contributes to the characteristic enlarged lamellar appearing rER cisternae in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and EDMI chondrocytes in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Towards the goal of delineating the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and EDM1, in-vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> growth plate and in-vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads were examined to identify and localize the chaperone proteins participating in the processing of the retained extracellular matrix proteins in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> rER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aggrecan was localized to both the rER cisternae and matrix while COMP and type IX collagen were only found in the rER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type II collagen was solely found in the ECM suggesting that it is processed and transported differently from other retained ECM proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five chaperone proteins: BiP (Grp78); calreticulin (CRT); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16249">protein disulfide</z:chebi> (PDI); ERp72; and Grp94, demonstrated immunoreactivity in the enlarged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> cisternae and the short rER channels of chondrocytes from both in-vivo and in-vitro samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chaperone proteins cluster around the electron dense material within the enlarged rER cisternae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CRT, PDI and GRP94 AB-gold particles appear to be closely associated with COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunoprecipitation and Western blot, and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analyses indicate that CRT, PDI and GRP94 are in close proximity to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant COMP and BiP to mutant COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that these proteins play a role in the processing and transport of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> COMP in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chondrocytes and in the retention of mutant COMP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
