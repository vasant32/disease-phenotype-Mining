<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean increase H-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> using the standard for ACH in three years in ACH (from -0.2 SD to 0.1 SD) is almost negligible but that in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> (from 1.2 SD to 2.6 SD) can be estimated as effective clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can be concluded short-term GH treatment in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> is effective to increase growth rate and H-<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>, but it has little effect in ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further studies would be required to confirm the other beneficial effects of GH treatment such as increase in bone mineral density in ACH and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and the effect on the final height </plain></SENT>
