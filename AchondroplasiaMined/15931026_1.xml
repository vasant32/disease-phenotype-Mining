<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen tibiae were treated by proximal closing wedge tibial osteotomy, proximal fibular epiphysiodesis and casts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve tibiae were treated by opening wedge osteotomies using external fixation with no fibular shortening </plain></SENT>
