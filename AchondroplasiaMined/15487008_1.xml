<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cervico-medullary compression is a frequently encountered and potentially lethal neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cervico-medullary decompression (CMD) at the foramen magnum is often employed to relieve the pressure on the emerging cervical cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the inherent risks associated with major surgery, there has been a substantial debate regarding the best criteria for CMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our objectives for this study are to explore the quality of life of patients who had undergone CMD, and to assess whether surgery is associated with mortality and increased long-term morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Medical Outcome Study 36-item Short Form General Health Survey designed to evaluate eight general health concepts as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-related issues, was administered to patients assessed in the neurosurgery department in Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1977 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty-seven patients were eligible for inclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-three could not be contacted, and two refused consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-two patients were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six (46%) individuals had CMD and 66 (54%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was 1 case of mortality in the CMD group and 12 cases in the non-CMD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the non-CMD group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, as far as we know, were unrelated to cervico-medullary compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this cohort of surviving patients (n = 109), the quality of life of the 55 (50.5%) who had undergone CMD is comparable to that of the 54 (49.5%) who did not have surgery, controlled for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CMD is indicated for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> with significant symptomatic foramen magnum compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It can be life saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It can abolish profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> that may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and alleviate neurological complications associated with damage of the significantly compressed spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With regards to long-term outcome evaluation, the quality of life of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who had CMD is similar to those age- and sex-matched patients who did not have this surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CMD, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> its inherent surgical risks, does not appear to be associated with higher mortality or increased long-term morbidity </plain></SENT>
