<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the COMP gene cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that expression of D469del-COMP in transgenic mice causes intracellular retention of D469del-COMP, thereby recapitulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> chondrocyte pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This inducible transgenic D469del-COMP mouse is the only in vivo model to replicate the critical cellular and clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report developmental studies of D469del-COMP-induced chondrocyte pathology from the prenatal period to adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D469del-COMP retention was limited prenatally and did not negatively affect the growth plate until 3 weeks after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of immunostaining, transcriptome analysis, and qRT-PCR suggest a molecular model in which D469del-COMP triggers <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> during the first postnatal week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 3 weeks (when most chondrocytes are retaining D469del-COMP), <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, and DNA damage contribute to chondrocyte cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by necroptosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, by crossing the D469del-COMP mouse onto a Chop null background (Ddit3 null), thereby eliminating Chop, the unfolded protein response was disrupted, thus alleviating both D469del-COMP intracellular retention and premature chondrocyte cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chop therefore plays a significant role in processes that mediate D469del-COMP retention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that there may be an optimal window before the induction of significant D469del-COMP retention during which endoplasmic reticulum stress could be targeted </plain></SENT>
