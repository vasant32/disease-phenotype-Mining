<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique results in overall elongations of more than 30 cm in the lower limbs, which makes it highly effective in the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteochondrodysplasia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003348'>hypopituitarism</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e>) and severe limb length discrepancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The techniques are used for elongating tibiae and femora as well as the modifications required to decrease <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar hyperlordosis</z:hpo> after lengthening of the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A review of the results and complications of the latest series treated with this technique consists of 208 tibiae and 156 femura </plain></SENT>
