<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar (TL) stenosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is frequently reported, and becomes symptomatic in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence we conducted a prospective study to determine cord level and occupancy at TL junction in symptomatic or asymptomatic achondroplasis patients in comparision to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cord level with its occupancy rate and TL <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> were measured on MRI and standing radiogram, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied MRI of TL spine in 19 patients (7 males and 12 females) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the subjects were randomly selected from our outpatient clinic and divided into two groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic group had at least two of the following symptoms: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> and walking difficulty, radicular pain in upper thigh or girdle pain, tingling and numbness in the lower limbs, visible deformity at TL spine and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001348'>brisk reflexes</z:hpo> in lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic group was selected from those patients who visited in outpatient clinic for consultation of limb lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third group was taken as control that comprised 11 nonachondroplasia otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients (8 males and 3 females) who presented to our outpatient clinic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed spinal cord level was higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> than nonachondroplasia (P=0.003); however, no difference in cord level between symptomatic and asymptomatic group (P=0.568) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparing cord occupancy, no difference found among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups (P=0.20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo> was increasing from nonachondroplasia, asymptomatic and symptomatic patient groups (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Average age was 22.4±14.2, 11.9±6.5, and 36.2±13.2 years in symptomatic, asymptomatic, and nonachondroplasia groups, respectively (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicated high level of spinal cord in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients compared to nonachondroplasia individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High prevalence of neurological symptoms at TL level in such patients can be associated with high cord level and developing progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> at TL level along with degenerative process </plain></SENT>
