<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical data of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> patients in the Sleep Center of the Duchess Kent Children's Habilitation Institute from May 1999 to May 2003 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> was diagnosed according to the abnormal sleep monitoring results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes were followed up and compared between the Operation and Non-operation groups (Control) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> children with adenotonsillar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (ATH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sleep endoscopy was performed for those who had residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> for the purpose of detecting the underlying causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> patients, 39 were associated with ATH, and 25 of the 39 patients underwent T &amp; A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The desaturation dip rate and minimum saturation in the Operation group were significantly improved after T &amp; A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six out of 25 (24%) patients in the Operation group had residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> whereas 11 out of the 13 (85%) patients in the Control group had unchanged or worsening clinical symptoms (OR=15.4, 95%CI 2.7- 87.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> after surgery were attributable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, upper airway structure anomaly and airway dynamic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T &amp; A was effective in the majority of Asian childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> associated with ATH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Upper airway structure or dynamic abnormalities can result in residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAHS</z:e> in parts of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is required to detect the underlying problems </plain></SENT>
