<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of virtual endoscopy of the spine in conjunction with spinal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several studies have described clinical applications of virtual endoscopy to visualize the inside of the bronchi, paranasal sinus, stomach, small intestine, pancreatic duct, and bile duct, but, to date, no study has described the use of virtual endoscopy in the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Virtual endoscopy is a realistic 3-dimensional intraluminal simulation of tubular structures that is generated by postprocessing of computed tomographic data sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal disease</z:e> were selected: 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e>, 2 patients with spinal deformity, and 1 patient with spinal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Virtual endoscopy software allows an observer to explore the spinal canal with a mouse, using multislice computed tomographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study found that virtual endoscopy of the spine has advantages compared with standard imaging methods because surgeons can noninvasively explore the spinal canal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Virtual endoscopy of the spine may be useful to surgeons for diagnosis, preoperative planning, and postoperative assessment by obviating the need to mentally construct a 3-dimensional picture of the spinal canal from 2-dimensional computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
