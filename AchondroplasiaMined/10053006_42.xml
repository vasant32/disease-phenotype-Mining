<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified a novel fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) missense mutation in four unrelated individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> that approaches the severity observed in thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> type I (TD1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, three of the four individuals developed extensive areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> beginning in early childhood, suffer from severe neurological impairments, and have survived past infancy without prolonged life-support measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The FGFR3 mutation (A1949T: Lys650Met) occurs at the nucleotide adjacent to the TD type II (TD2) mutation (A1948G: Lys650Glu) and results in a different amino acid substitution at a highly conserved codon in the kinase domain activation loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection studies with FGFR3 mutant constructs show that the Lys650Met mutation causes a dramatic increase in constitutive receptor kinase activity, approximately three times greater than that observed with the Lys650Glu mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We refer to the phenotype caused by the Lys650Met mutation as "severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>" (SADDAN) because it differs significantly from the phenotypes of other known FGFR3 mutations </plain></SENT>
