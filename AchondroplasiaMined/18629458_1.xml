<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Knowledge of bone age in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is required for the prediction of adult height, timings of limb lengthening, and epiphysiodesis procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this investigation was to determine the differences in skeletal age in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and a control population with the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method using the RUS score and to determine the right age for the interventional procedure for limb lengthening procedure or deformity correction in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Left hand radiographs of 34 patients (age range, 5-18 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were evaluated for skeletal age using the RUS scoring system, which were compared with the left hand radiographs of 41 patients (age range, 5-18 years) without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> measuring skeletal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference in chronological age and RUS bone age were evaluated statistically according to gender and age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> group, chronological age were 10.5 +/- 4.3 years for males and 10.1 +/- 3.6 years for females and RUS bone age were 9.2 +/- 4.0 years for males and 8.9 +/- 3.4 years for females, which showed statistically significantly difference (males p = 0.0003 and females p &lt; 0.0001), while in the control group, chronological age were 11.1 +/- 2.9 years for males and 10.7 +/- 3.4 years for females and RUS bone age were 11.2 +/- 3.4 years for males and 10.7 +/- 3.3 years for females, which did not show statistically significantly difference (males p = 0.54 and females p = 0.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our finding suggested a delay of 1.4 years for males and 1.2 years for females in the maturation of bone in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Difference between chronological age and RUS bone age was 0.9 +/- 1.1 for &lt;10 years and 1.6 +/- 0.9 for &gt;10 years in the study group, while 0.1 +/- 1.1 for &lt;10 years and -0.2 +/- 0.6 for &gt;10 years in the control group, which also showed &gt;statistically significant difference (&lt;10 years p = 0.04 and &gt;10 years p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences indicate that there was a delay in the maturation of bones by 1 year in the group &lt;10 years and 1.8 years in the group &gt;10 years in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients compared to nonachondroplasia patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method especially the radius, ulna, short bone score to measure the skeletal age and to wait for a longer time before interventional procedures in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
