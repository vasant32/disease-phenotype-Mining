<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to clarify genotype-phenotype correlation in ACH and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, we investigated the presence of the previously identified mutations of FGFR3 in 26 patients with ACH- or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>-mimicking features and compared clinical and radiographic findings between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using genomic DNA sequencing and RFLP analysis, G380R, an ACH-specific mutation, and N540K, an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>-specific mutation, were detected in 13 patients (50%) and five patients (19%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No mutations of FGFR3 were detected in eight patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No remarkable clinical or radiological differences were evident among the ACH infants and children with G380R, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> patients with N540K, and the patients without verified mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that genotype-based diagnosis needs to precede proper genetic counseling for patients with ACH or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, which show very similar clinical and radiological features </plain></SENT>
