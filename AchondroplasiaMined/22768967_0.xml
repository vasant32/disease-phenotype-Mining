<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> associated with posterior vertebral rim fracture is even more uncommon but nonetheless causes pain and disability in affected children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe the surgical results of 3 adolescents presenting with neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> and posterior vertebral rim fracture when treated with laminectomy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical and operative records of the 3 pediatric patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presenting signs and symptoms and CT findings, such as the interpedicular distances between T-12 and L-5, were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative results were assessed, including operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings at latest follow-up were also recorded, including a patient satisfaction survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 3 patients (1 girl and 2 boys) had a mean age of 14.7 years (range 14-15 years) and underwent follow-up for a mean of 11.3 months (range 5-18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Notable preoperative signs and symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients), leg pain (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients), leg numbness (1 patient), and <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient presented with bowel and/or bladder dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean blood loss during laminectomy was 123 ml (range 20-300 ml), and the mean length of hospital stay was 4.3 days (range 3-6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On average, decompression was performed at 2.2 levels (range 2-2.5 levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 patients reported at most recent follow-up that they were "satisfied" with the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was 1 complication of instability from an iatrogenic pars fracture, which required reoperation and posterior instrumented fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this report represents the first surgical series of pediatric neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pediatric neurosurgeons may infrequently encounter neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> associated with a posterior vertebral rim fracture in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To treat children with neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> associated with posterior vertebral rim fractures, a simple laminectomy may be a safe and efficacious alternative to discectomy and removal of fracture fragments </plain></SENT>
