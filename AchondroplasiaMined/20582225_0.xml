<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 is expressed in different tissues, including cartilage, brain, kidney, and intestine at different development stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conventional knockout of Fgfr3 alleles leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>short life span</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In clinic, human FGFR3 mutations are responsible for three different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> syndromes including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH), hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>) and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For better understanding of the roles of FGFR3 in different tissues at different stages of development and in pathological conditions, we generated Fgfr3 conditional knockout mice in which loxp sites flank exons 9-10 in the Fgfr3 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that Cre-mediated recombination using Col2a1-Cre, a Cre line expressed in chondrocyte during bone development, results in specific deletion of the gene in tissues containing cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This animal model will be useful to study distinct roles of FGFR3 in different tissues at different ages </plain></SENT>
