<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate lower-extremity rotational abnormalities in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> using computed tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT scans were performed in 25 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (13 skeletally immature, mean age 8.7 years; 12 skeletally mature, mean age 17.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a total of 50 bilateral limbs, CT images were used to measure the angles of acetabular anteversion, femoral anteversion, and tibial external <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurement was performed by three examiners and then repeated by one examiner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inter- and intraobserver agreements were analyzed, and results were compared with previously reported <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean values for skeletally immature and skeletally mature subjects were 13.6+/-7.5 degrees and 21.5+/-6.4 degrees respectively for acetabular anteversion, 27.1+/-20.8 degrees and 30.5+/-20.1 degrees for femoral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath>, and 21.6+/-10.6 degrees and 22.5+/-10.8 degrees for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100694'>tibial torsion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intra- and interobserver agreements were good to excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Acetabular anteversion and femoral anteversion in skeletally mature subjects were greater than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both skeletally immature and mature subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0100694'>tibial torsion</z:hpo> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skeletally immature and mature subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lower-extremity rotational abnormalities in subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> include decreased tibial external <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> in both skeletally immature and mature subjects, as well as increased femoral and acetabular anteversion in skeletally mature subjects </plain></SENT>
