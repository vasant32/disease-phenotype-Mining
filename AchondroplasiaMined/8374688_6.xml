<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before beginning growth hormone (GH) treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, we evaluated their growth pattern and their hypothalamic-pituitary function, including GH secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 22 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (7 males and 15 females: age range, 3 to 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The z-score of their height at admission was -5.4 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD), and that of their annual height gain before admission was -3.1 +/- 1.3 (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GH response to provocative tests was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except five: four showed subnormal (&lt; 10 ng/ml) response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15765">L-Dopa</z:chebi> stimuli, and one patient showed subnormal (&lt; 20 ng/ml) response to GRF stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean GH concentration during sleep was found to be low (&lt; 5 ng/ml) in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These three patients were suspected to have latent GH deficiency, as they also showed a markedly low IGF-1 level and marked delay of bone age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LH, FSH, TSH, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> response to provocative tests were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We treated this group of patients with recombinant human GH (1 IU/kg/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients who were treated with GH for more than 6 months, height velocity during GH therapy was significantly increased compared to that before GH therapy (4.1 +/- 0.8 cm/year vs 7.2 +/- 1.4 cm/year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that parameters reflecting hypothalamic-pituitary function, particularly GH secretion, should be examined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients, and that GH treatment may be beneficial in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
