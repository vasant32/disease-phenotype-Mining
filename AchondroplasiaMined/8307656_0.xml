<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Missing data are accommodated: we assume that the study is planned so that individuals will have common times of measurement, but allow some of the sequences to be incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degrees, Di, adequate to fit the growth profiles of the N individuals are determined and the corresponding polynomial regression coefficients are calculated and can be saved in ASCII files which may then be imported into a statistical computing package for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examples of the use of the program are provided </plain></SENT>
