<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because they observed a unique sagittal spinopelvic phenotype in some achondroplastic children with very <z:hpo ids='HP_0003440'>horizontal sacrums</z:hpo>, the authors sought to quantify the spinopelvic parameters in a pediatric patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was performed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children (age range 1 month-10 years) with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> between 2004 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> (LL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo> (TK), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> (TLK), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), and pelvic incidence (PI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences among these variables were analyzed using a 2-tailed, unpaired Student t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty children, 23 males and 17 females, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were identified during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 2.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two groups of patients were identified based on PT (that is, negative or positive tilt and horizontal or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0003440'>horizontal sacrum</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A negative PT was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with an extremely <z:hpo ids='HP_0003440'>horizontal sacrum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen children had a negative PT (mean -16.6°), and the mean parameters in this group were 65.4° for LL, 31.7° for TLK, 18.5° for TK, 43.3° for SS, and 26.4° for PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three children had a positive PT (mean 17.9°), and the mean parameters in this group were 53.4° for LL, 41.5° for TLK, 9.6° for TK, 30.8° for SS, and 43.8° for PI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant difference was observed for LL (p = 0.01), TLK (p = 0.05), SS (p = 0.006), PT (p = 0.006), and PI (0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spinopelvic parameters in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> are potentially dichotomous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The future implications of this observation are not known and will need to be explored in future long-term studies that follow pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> through adulthood </plain></SENT>
