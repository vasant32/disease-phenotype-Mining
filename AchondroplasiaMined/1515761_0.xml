<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Collagen extracted either from cartilage or synthesized in vitro was analyzed to identify possible molecular defects in the cartilaginous matrix of a male fetus suffering from a mild form of type II achondrogenesis (Langer-Saldino) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tissue architecture of the patient's cartilage was markedly altered and showed numerous fibrous vascular canals which were focally stained by antibodies against collagens I and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collagen II was present, although heterogenously distributed throughout the cartilaginous matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon electrophoretic separation, however, the patient's femoral head cartilage showed the presence of collagens II, IX and XI only, which was similar to an age-matched control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi>/hydroxylysine ratio of collagen II of the patient was not significantly different from that of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the compositions of collagens synthesized by cultured chondrocytes as well as fibroblasts were similar in the patient and the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results provide strong evidence that, in the present mild case of Langer-Saldino achondrogenesis, collagen II is expressed and regularly hydroxylated at its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may indicate that cartilage components other than collagen II may be responsible for the altered tissue organization observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Along with previous observations, our data suggest that the degree of biochemical matrix alterations may be related to the severity of the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
