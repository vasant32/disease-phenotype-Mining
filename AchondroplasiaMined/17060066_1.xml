<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate the existence of a relationship between head circumference (HC), height and weight, (2) to build an instrument for evaluating it and validate its clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Relationship between HC, height and weight was explored in a national sample of 3571 healthy, well nourished boys and girls aged 0-5.99 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted correlation coefficients calculated were: HC and height, 0.30; HC and weight, 0.37; and height and weight, 0.60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A growth standard of HC to height ratio was constructed using the LMS method with both sexes pooled, and selected centiles and SD scores of HC to height ratio for each age were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Z-scores of HC for age, and HC to height ratio were calculated for 13 children with hypochondroplasia, and 90 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, both conditions associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only four children with hypochondroplasia had HC for age above 2.00 SD, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them showed SD scores above 2.00 when the HC to height ratio was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that the prepared standard may be of clinical utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A new standard is proposed, capable of pinpointing children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004482'>relative macrocephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
