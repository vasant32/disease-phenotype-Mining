<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> are constitutional, generalized or localized disorders of the skeletal system involving a disturbance of growth and/or bone density; their genetic transmission varies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathomorphologically, a combined functional-structural disturbance of the cartilaginous and/or bone tissue is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the result is varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the framework of a systematic examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, a total of 84 iliac crest specimens/biopsies obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillborn</z:hpo> infants and patients varying in age from a few days to 40 years, were investigated in the electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sections prepared extended from the perichondrium through the proximal resting zone to the primary mineralization zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The structure of the collagen fibrils was studied in diastrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e>, the WOLCOTT-RALLISON syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e>, and idiopathic juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In diastrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo>, the cartilaginous ground substance contains collagen fibrils that can vary considerably in length, structure and diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case of WOLCOTT-RALLISON syndrome, the lacunae of the chondrocytes are found to contain very wide amianthoid-like and inadequately aggregated collagen fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In numerous cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> reveals very fine and also irregularly structured collagen fibrils with scarcely discernible cross-striation in the region of the osteoid, which is of varying width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some of the cases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23053">catechin</z:chebi> has a favourable effect on the formation of collagen fibrils, resulting in broader and more densely packed fibrils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the conditions are associated with considerable intracellular changes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The varying collagen fibril findings in the cartilage and bone tissue also represent a morphological marker of the combined functional-structural disorder of chondrocytes and/or osteoblasts, and an expression of the differing aetiopathogenesis </plain></SENT>
