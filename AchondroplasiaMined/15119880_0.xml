<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three cases of pediatric patients who met with severe difficulties in their adaptation to commercially available nasal masks are described: one premature infant, one child diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and one child with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0007110'>central hypoventilation</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In each case, a light nasal mask was designed with two independent parts that become perfectly adapted to the patient's nose: one soft for the skin contact, and another rigid for dimensional stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, adequate levels of ventilation were reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This easy, inexpensive nasal mask fabrication technique can be used in a great number of patients, increasing the efficacy of individualized masks </plain></SENT>
