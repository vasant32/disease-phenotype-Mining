<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of human growth hormone (hGH) on the growth of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and one patient with hypochondroplasia were treated with 0.5 IU/kg/W of pituitary-extracted hGH for 6-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean height velocity was significantly increased from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm/year (P less than 0.05) by hGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tibial index, defined as the length/width ratio of left tibia, did not change during the treatment, indicating that hGH promotes growth without exaggeration of tubular bone deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial dislocation</z:hpo>, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and neurological deficits during the second hGH treatment, but these were cured by operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, hGH therapy is effective in promoting growth in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, but the complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial dislocation</z:hpo> should be explored and corrected before the treatment </plain></SENT>
