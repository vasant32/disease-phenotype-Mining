<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paternal-age information for babies born with defects was obtained from birth certificates, hospital records, and interviews with mothers; for babies born without defects, the information was obtained from birth certificates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several statistical techniques were used to evaluate the paternal-age-birth-defects associations for 86 groups of defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis that controlled for maternal age and race indicated that older fathers had a somewhat higher risk for having babies with defects, when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of defects were combined; an equivalent association for older mothers was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses also indicated modestly higher risks for older fathers for having babies with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001629'>ventricular septal defects</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001631'>atrial septal defects</z:hpo> and substantially higher risks for having babies with defects classified in the category <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodystrophy</z:mp> (largely <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) and babies with <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An association between elevated paternal age and <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> has not been reported before; the magnitude of the estimated increased risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp> was about the same as that found in this study for <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodystrophy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
