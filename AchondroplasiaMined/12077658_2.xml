<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (18 lengthenings; mean age at operation, 11.0 years) underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning weekly during the distraction phase, at 2-week intervals until removal of the fixator, and at the time of each outpatient visit after removal of the apparatus for a median of 353 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three transverse regions remained significantly different in the 7 achondroplastic patients throughout the study, but the difference among these regions became nonsignificant by fixator removal in the 11 limb length discrepancy (LLD) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most proximal region was significantly more mineralized throughout the study in the achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The central region became the region of highest mineralization in the LLD patients by week 16 after removal of the fixator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three longitudinal regions showed significantly different mineralization at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points except at fixator removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The central and medial regions always showed the highest mineralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanical characteristics of the fixator and the biomechanical features of the lengthening site may account for the mineralization gradient reported in this study and should probably be taken into account when planning removal of the fixator and subsequent weight-bearing </plain></SENT>
