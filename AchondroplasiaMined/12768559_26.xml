<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>Skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> can be recognized by two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound, but generating a precise diagnosis can be challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether three-dimensional (3D) imaging conferred any advantages over 2D imaging in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied five women with fetuses of 16-28 gestational weeks referred for abnormal ultrasound skeletal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First 2D and then 3D sonography was performed and the results compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pregnancies resulted in the following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>: thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, achondrogenesis II/hypochondrogenesis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> punctata (rhizomelic form) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five fetuses, the correct diagnosis was made in the prenatal period by analysis of the 2D images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In each case the 3D images confirmed the preliminary diagnosis and for many findings it improved the visualization of the abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 3D imaging had advantages over the 2D imaging when it came to evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphism</z:hpo>, relative proportion of the appendicular skeletal elements and the hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the patient and referring physician appreciated the 3D images of the abnormal findings more readily which aided in counseling and management of the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
