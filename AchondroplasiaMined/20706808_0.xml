<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> is particularly challenging as a result of the anatomic variances and substantial bony deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little has been written regarding technical considerations that should be made when performing TKA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We describe special operative considerations that must be made when performing TKA on patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, including implant selection and ligamentous balancing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 12 TKAs in eight patients with varying degrees of deformity (ranging from 30° of varus to 45° of valgus) secondary to three types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>: multiple hereditary <z:mp ids='MP_0009877'>exostosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical notes, operative records, and radiographic data were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minimum followup was 1 year (average, 4 years; range, 1-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We used customized implants in three of the 12 knees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Constrained tibial inserts were used in five knees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 knees underwent releases (soft tissue or epicondylar osteotomy) to address gap balancing or patellar tracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average Knee Society scores improved from 35.9 preoperatively to 82.9 postoperatively and average function scores improved from 47.9 preoperatively to 96.7 postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications included two transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270810" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peroneal nerve palsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Special considerations must be made with regard to implant selection and ligamentous balancing as a result of the unusual <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and deformities that accompany <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, but the short-term clinical results reveal consistent improvements in pain and function </plain></SENT>
