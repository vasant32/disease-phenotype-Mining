<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sent questionnaires to doctors treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> with severe GH deficiency (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e>) (height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (HtSDS) below -4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> peak GH to provocative stimuli below 2 micro/L) (abbreviated as Severe Case), and obtained effective replies of 51 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics, etiologies, and pathophysiology of these patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 51 Severe Cases no consanguinity was observed, 44 were IGHD (24 males and 20 females), 3 were GH-1 gene deletion, 2 were Pit-1 gene mutation, and 2 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HtSDS in these Severe Cases was already remarkably low at 12 (-3.0) and 24 months old (-3.9), while their birth weight and birth length were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 44 patients with IGHD, 12 were isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e>, and the remaining 32 were combined pituitary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599750" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hormone deficiency</z:e> (CPHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pituitary MRI was undergone in 25 idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e>, and abnormal findings (pituitary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, interruption of stalk, and ectopic posterior lobe) were observed in 21 patients with CPHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than half of these patients had the history of breech delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients with GH-1 gene mutation showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pituitary MRI, whereas one of two patients with Pit-1 mutation showed pituitary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and narrowing of pituitary stalk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, Severe Cases tended to have CPHD, and the incidence of Severe Case was only 0.6% of total IGHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> is considered to be extremely rare (0.06% of total IGHD), the incidence reaches high levels (9.8%) among Severe Cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Growth disorders in these Severe Cases seem to occur soon after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Much earlier diagnosis and hGH treatment are desirable to attain better final height in the Severe Cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GH-1 and Pit-1 gene analyses are crucial, when genetic abnormalities other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> are suspected </plain></SENT>
