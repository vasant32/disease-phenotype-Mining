<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with 10 nonachondroplastic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of morphologic changes were seen, including (1) poor development of mastoid air cells, (2) foreshortening of the carotid canals, (3) narrowing of the skull base, (4) "towering" petrous ridges, and (5) relative "rotation" of the cochlea and other temporal bone structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most significant change was the rotational effect, which was more pronounced medially, resulting in an abnormal orientation of inner ear structures relative to middle ear structures and of middle ear structures relative to the external auditory canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a notable lack of evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> or its sequelae in any of the achondroplastic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000410'>mixed hearing loss</z:hpo> in the four children, but only of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that the persistent hearing loss in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is not due to sequelae of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> as some authors have suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic vestibulocochlear changes below the limits of resolution of high-resolution CT scanning may be responsible </plain></SENT>
