<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD) in the lengthened callus space were evaluated every 1 or 2 weeks for 10 weeks after the start of distraction using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean rate of callus mineralization in femurs (0.64 g/wk) was higher than in tibias (0.22 g/wk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean BMD at 10 weeks after the start was 0.35 g/cm2 in the femur and 0.14 g/cm2 in the tibia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different rates of callus formation in different kinds of long tubular bones have not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
