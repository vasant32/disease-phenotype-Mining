<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the genotype could be distinguished on the basis of the phenotype, we analysed height, arm span, and skeletal radiographs from 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and the G380R mutation of FGFR3 and eight with hypochondroplasia and the N540K mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both conditions share the classical pathological features of micromelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, reduced or unchanged interpedicular distances in the lumbar spine, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003085'>disproportionately long fibulae</z:hpo>, and squared and shortened pelvic ilia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These were significantly more severe in the G380R patients than in the N540K patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings have shown a firm statistical correlation between the genotype and the phenotype, although there were a few exceptional cases in which there was phenotypic overlap between the two conditions </plain></SENT>
