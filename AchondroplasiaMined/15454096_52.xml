<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSCs derived from the iliac crest were cultured with osteogenic supplements and differentiated into osteoblast-like cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PRP, which is known to contain several growth factors and coagulate immediately by a minute introduction of thrombin and calcium, was prepared just before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Culture-expanded osteoblast-like cells and autologous PRP were injected into the distracted callus with the thrombin-calcium mixture so that the PRP gel might develop within the injected site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of MSCs and PRP was done at the lengthening and consolidation period in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The target lengths were obtained in every leg without major complications and the average healing index was 23.0 days/cm (18.8-26.9 days/cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although these results are still preliminary, transplantation of osteoblast-like cells and PRP, which seemed to be a safe and minimally invasive cell therapy, could shorten the treatment period by acceleration of bone regeneration during distraction osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
