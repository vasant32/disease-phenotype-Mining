<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cine phase-contrast (PC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is a convenient and effective method for measuring volumetric flow rates in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to evaluate changes in blood flow in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in children and to assess the hypothesis that restricted venous outflow attributable to stenosis of the jugular vein causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood flow in the SSS was measured by using cine PC <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with a 1.5-T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After validation, 35 neurologically healthy children as well as eight children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>) and two children with obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Average flow velocity over the cardiac cycle and volumetric flow rate in the SSS were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data for healthy children were plotted as a function of age, and reference values were defined by using a five-point smoothing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In healthy children, flow velocity ranged from 92 to 196 mm/s (mean, 136), and flow rate from 189 to 688 mL/min (mean, 484) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The flow rate showed changes statistically related to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It rapidly increased during the first 2 years and reached a peak by 6 to 8 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The flow velocity showed a similar pattern, but not with significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, both flow values were reduced below the reference values minus one standard deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and in obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, the values were not reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Blood flow in the SSS reflects brain maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was found to be closely related to reduced flow in the SSS, which supports the hypothesis that restricted venous outflow causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
