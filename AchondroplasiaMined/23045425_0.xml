<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common SKDs that typically result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> include <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>/hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>) both caused by different mutations in the same gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> diagnosis is based on the clinical appearance during development and conventional X-ray findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In about 70% of patients, missense mutations in the gene coding for the fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) affects the amino acid at position 540, mostly resulting in the amino acid exchange N540K.Subjects with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, heterozygous for the N540K substitution are significantly more disproportionate than individuals without this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report the clinical and radiographic features of an Italian family with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> with an unusual N540S mutation, inside the common mutation hot spot of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first case reported in Italy and the third in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a 7-years-follow-up, the boy started the puberty at the age of 11.3 years and the growth spurt was observed between 13.7 and 14.9 years (+ 9.1 cm.).During pubertal development the sitting height (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) improved from - 1.5 to - 0.6 and the subischial leg length (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>) progressed from - 2.6 to - 3.3.At the age of 16.7 year the standing height was 157.6 cm ( - 2.4 SDS), testicular volume was 15 ml and bone age 16.5 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study and the other two cases reported in the literature stress the important role of the asn 540 site in the tyrosine kinase I domain in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and underline the importance that, in patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> who do not have the common N540K mutation, sequence analysis of the tyrosine kinase I domain of FGFR3 should be performed to exclude other changes in that region </plain></SENT>
