<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the histological structure of seriated cartilage, and the distribution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> in resting cartilage are the same in cn/cn mice and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only difference betweeen the two types of animals is represented by the occurence of early aging-like changes of chondrocytes and cartilage matrix in achondroplastic mice, leading to premature shortening of the cell columns and to early reduction of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The premature "aging" of the cartilage, the consequent inhibition of the calcification process and bone growth, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rate of perichondral ossification give to long bones, vertebrae and ribs a typical achondroplastic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cn/cn mice seem to represent a useful model for studying the pathogenesis and therapy of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
