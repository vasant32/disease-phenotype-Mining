<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mice showed a dwarf phenotype similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, caused by activating mutations in FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mice displayed incomplete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of chondrocytes in the growth plates and a general delay in endochondral ossification, whereas chondrocyte proliferation was unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the cranial base in transgenic embryos showed reduced staining for collagen type X and persistent expression of Sox9 in chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that the MAPK pathway inhibits hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and negatively regulates bone growth without inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Expression of a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 in chondrocytes of Fgfr3-deficient mice inhibited skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, strongly suggesting that regulation of bone growth by FGFR3 is mediated at least in part by the MAPK pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although loss of Stat1 restored the reduced chondrocyte proliferation in mice expressing an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> mutant of Fgfr3, it did not rescue the reduced hypertrophic zone, the delay in formation of secondary ossification centers, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest a model in which Fgfr3 signaling inhibits bone growth by inhibiting chondrocyte differentiation through the MAPK pathway and by inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation through Stat1 </plain></SENT>
