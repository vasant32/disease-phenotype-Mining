<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the individual, vascular, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>, blood testis barrier and Sertoli cells changes because of age lead a decrease of spermatozoa number and an alteration in their form and motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These changes lead a gradual decrease of fertility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the progeny, paternal ageing is responsible for new dominant autosomic mutations which themselves cause different malformations, as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406030" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Recklinghausen</z:e> disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024796" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MFS|MFS1">Marfan Syndrome</z:e> etc. and perhaps for certain chromosome <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X linked</z:hpo> recessive mutations as Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> or hemophily A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in animal and man, paternal ageing seems responsible for a gradual lowering in the level of progeny cerebral functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In man, very youthful age is also related to these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the curve corresponding to this phenomenon presents an inverted U-Shape, of which the top corresponds to about thirty years of paternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal age does not appear to play a part in this event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the whole, these results pose the problem of the optimum age for fatherhood </plain></SENT>
