<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These distances can be computed on the basis of the individual growth curves themselves and/or from estimates of individuals' growth velocity and acceleration curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resulting distance matrices can be saved in ASCII format and subsequently imported into any clustering program which accepts this type of input, e.g. SYSTAT </plain></SENT>
