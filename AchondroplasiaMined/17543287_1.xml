<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have tested the ability of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> to decrease the activation of MAPK in chondrocytes with achondroplasic FGFR3 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diadenosine tetraphosphate, Ap(4)A, reduced the phosphorylation of pERK1/2 triggered by FGF9 (38% reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ap(4)A diminished the expression of achondroplasic FGFR3 receptor (65% reduction), stimulating FGFR3 receptor degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The action of Ap(4)A seems to be mediated by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> receptor rather than by any other ATP receptor </plain></SENT>
