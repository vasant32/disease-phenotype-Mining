<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For practical purpose a schematic representation of these types is given, based upon the classification of congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteochondrodysplasias</z:e> by the ESPR (European Society of Pediatric Radiology, Rome, 1969) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a second part the single diseases are discussed according to the scheme with their radiological differential diagnosis and their prominent changes in the skeletal system </plain></SENT>
