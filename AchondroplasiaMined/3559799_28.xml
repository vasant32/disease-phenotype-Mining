<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied prospectively 26 young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> to test two hypotheses: that respiratory problems may be the result of occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo>, and that achondroplastic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> might have occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002086'>respiratory abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002086'>Respiratory abnormalities</z:hpo> were present in 85%, the majority caused by a primary problem of the pulmonary system, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0010103'>small thoracic cage</z:mp> or obstructed airway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had hypoxemia, recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001575'>cyanotic</z:mp> spells, and episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> explainable only by cervicomedullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e>; in each patient, respiratory problems were alleviated by decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another six patients with cervicomedullary compression had, in addition, at least one primary pulmonary cause of respiratory problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After decompressive surgery the respiratory problems improved in three and were unchanged in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reconstructed sagittal CT images proved the most sensitive technique for detecting craniocervical stenosis as a cause of cervicomedullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e>, although some degree of stenosis was present in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
