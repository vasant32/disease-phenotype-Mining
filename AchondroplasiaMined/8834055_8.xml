<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients' age ranged from 2 11/12 to 8 5/12 years and the GH dose was of 0.1 IU/kg/day subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Auxological assessments and bone age determinations were performed 6 months before, at the beginning, and after 6 and 12 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The growth velocity increase during the whole year of treatment ranged from 1.1 to 2.6 cm/year in 3 patients while in the others no variation was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No side effects were observed during the trial apart from a slight advancement of bone age in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI at the cervicomedullary junction and CT scan of the base of the skull did not show any variation of the dimensions of the foramen magnum at the end of the trial compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that r-hGH can safely increase short-term growth velocity in some but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> prepubertal children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the individual variability in the response to the GH treatment </plain></SENT>
