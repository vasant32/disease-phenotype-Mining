<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four crania, presenting with various manifestations of an occipital vertebra, such as a paracondylar process, epicondylar process, hypocondylar arch, and a third condyle were identified as well as two crania showing various degrees of assimilation of the atlas to the basicranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the identification of a cloverleaf-shaped foramen magnum in a cranium of an individual with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> as well as a cranium with marked asymmetry of both foramen magnum and occipital condyles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the availability of both cranium and corresponding atlanto-axial components, the clinical significance of certain aspects of craniovertebral anomalies were vividly demonstrated, such as a pseudarthrosis formed by the meeting of a paracondylar process with an epitransverse process and a dens "riding high" in the foramen magnum as a result of assimilation of the atlas </plain></SENT>
