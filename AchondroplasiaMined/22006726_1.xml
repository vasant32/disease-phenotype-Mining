<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine disease mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> in vivo, we introduced the Comp D469del mutation into the mouse genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutant animals were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at birth but grew slower than their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limb dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the growth plates of mutant mice chondrocyte columns were reduced in number and poorly organized, while mutant COMP was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chondrocyte proliferation was reduced and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was both increased and spatially dysregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous studies on COMP mutations have shown mutant COMP is co-localized with chaperone proteins, and we have reported an unfolded protein response (UPR) in mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>-MED (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo>) harboring mutations in Comp (T585M) and Matn3, Comp etc (V194D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found no evidence of UPR in this mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, microarray analysis identified expression changes in groups of genes implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, cell cycle regulation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which is consistent with the chondrocyte pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data suggest that a novel form of chondrocyte stress triggered by the expression of mutant COMP is central to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
