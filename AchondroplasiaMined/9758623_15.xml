<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations probably arise through spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of CpG mutation rates in disease-linked genes, such as factor VIII and FGFR3, have indicated that they more frequently originate in male than in female germ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been speculated that these sex-biased mutation rates might be a consequence of sex-specific methylation differences between the female and the male germ lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-based genomic-sequencing method, we investigated the methylation status of the human factor VIII and FGFR3 genes in mature male and female germ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the exception of a single CpG, both genes were found to be equally and highly methylated in oocytes and spermatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whereas these observations strongly support the notion that DNA methylation is the major determining factor for recurrent CpG germ-line mutations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the higher mutation rate in the male germ line is apparently not a simple reflection of sex-specific methylation differences </plain></SENT>
