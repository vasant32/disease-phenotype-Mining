<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, efforts have been made to develop growth curves specific for several of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, data concerning weight for height have been largely lacking, although they may be of particular importance for conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, where there is some consensus that an increased prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> is a particular problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper we provide standard weight for height curves for males and females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and discuss the use of several indices which have been applied to the assessment of body fat in the general population </plain></SENT>
