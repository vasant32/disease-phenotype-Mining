<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a radiographic, morphologic, biochemical and molecular study in a case of achondrogenesis type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electron micrographs showed inclusion bodies of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum in the chondrocytes and the presence of sparse collagen fibers in the cartilage matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Protein analysis of collagen from cartilage indicated posttranslational overmodification of the major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306,29308">cyanogen</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi>, and suggested a mutation near the carboxyl terminus of the type II collagen molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis at the DNA level demonstrated that the phenotype was produced by a single base change (G--&gt;C) that resulted in the substitution of glycine691 by arginine in the type II collagen triple helical domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We confirm previous observations in three cases of hypochondrogenesis that glycine substitutions in the alpha 1(II) chain can result in a phenotype at the most severe end of the type II collagenopathy spectrum </plain></SENT>
