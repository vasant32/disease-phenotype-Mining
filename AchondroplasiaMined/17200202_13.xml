<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because COMP exists as a homopentamer, only one mutant COMP subunit may result in an abnormal complex that is accumulated in expanded rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) cisternae, a hallmark of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type IX collagen and matrilin-3 (MATN3), also accumulate in the rER cisternae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocytes, but it is unknown how mutant COMP interacts with these proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies herein focus on defining the organization of these intracellularly retained proteins using fluorescence deconvolution microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A unique matrix organization was identified in which type II procollagen formed a central core surrounded by a protein network of mutant COMP, type IX collagen, and MATN3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This pattern of matrix organization was found in multiple cisternae from single chondrocytes and in chondrocytes with different COMP mutations, indicating a common pattern of interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that stalling of mutant COMP and an interaction between mutant COMP and type II procollagen are initiating events in the assembly of matrix in the rER, possibly explaining why the material is not readily cleared from the rER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data suggest that mutant COMP initiates and perhaps catalyzes premature intracellular matrix assembly </plain></SENT>
