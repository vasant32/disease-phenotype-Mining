<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thyroid hormone (T(3)) regulates chondrocyte proliferation and is essential for hypertrophic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are also important regulators of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, and activating mutations of FGF receptor-3 (FGFR3) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hypothesis that T(3) regulates chondrogenesis via FGFR3 in ATDC5 cells, which undergo a defined program of chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATDC5 cells expressed two FGFR1, four FGFR2, and one FGFR3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splice variants throughout chondrogenesis, and expression of each isoform was stimulated by T(3) during the first 6-12 d of culture, when T(3) inhibited proliferation by 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 expression was also increased in cells treated with T(3) for 21 d, when T(3) induced an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hypertrophic differentiation and collagen X expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 expression was reduced in growth plates from T(3) receptor alpha-null mice, which exhibit skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, but was increased in T(3) receptor beta(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>) mice, which display skeletal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that FGFR3 is a T(3)-target gene in chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In further experiments, T(3) enhanced FGF2 and FGF18 activation of the MAPK-signaling pathway but inhibited their activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FGF9 did not activate MAPK or signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 pathways in the absence or presence of T(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, T(3) exerted differing effects on FGFR activation during chondrogenesis depending on which FGF ligand stimulated the FGFR and which downstream signaling pathway was activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies identify novel interactions between T(3) and FGFs that regulate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during chondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
