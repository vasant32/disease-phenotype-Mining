<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was also an increase in mean maternal age (not significant) which disappeared after adjusting for paternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant increase in maternal or paternal age was found in cases having OI either of a dominant type with an affected parent or of a type (Sillence type III) usually regarded as recessive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, as in certain other dominant conditions, the risk of mutant OI increases with paternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the rate of increase of risk with paternal age appears to be considerably lower than, for example, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall risk of fresh dominant mutation in older fathers may therefore be lower than has previously been suggested </plain></SENT>
