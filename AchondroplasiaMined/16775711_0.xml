<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, cause and importance of this sign in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and to reveal how it differs from in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Perthes' disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Serial radiograms, along with 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional CT images were studied in 42 achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty-two achondroplastic patients, reported at our institute (for routine outpatient consultation, spine surgeries, deformity corrections, limb-lengthening procedures) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 26 males and 16 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sign was observed bilaterally, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of CT images revealed spherical heads, with presence of circumferential overhang in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This circumferential overhang, seen on 3-D CT scan, corresponded to the sagging rope sign on radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presence of the sagging rope sign in bilateral hips is a characteristic feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It usually appears before epiphyseal closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its cause, incidence, and nature differ from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023234" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Perthes' disease</z:e>, and its presence does not carry a bad prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
