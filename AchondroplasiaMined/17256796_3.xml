<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report on a mother and daughter with hypochondroplasia (Hch) caused by a new heterozygous double mutation (1138_1139GG &gt; AA) at the same codon 380, but encoding a lysine instead of the usual arginine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous functional assays of these codon 380 amino acid substitutions demonstrated a lesser activation of receptor signaling by lysine compared to arginine [Webster and Donoghue, 1996; EMBO J 15:520-527] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This could explain the milder phenotype observed in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several other rare double mutations were previously described in both FGFR2 and FGFR3 and interpreted as resulting from positive selection of spermatogonial cells owing to gain-of-function in the encoded protein [Goriely et al., 2005; Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:6051-6056] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case contributes additional support for this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
