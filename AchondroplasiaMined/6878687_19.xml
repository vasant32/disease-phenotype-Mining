<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Achondrogenesis is a phenotypically diverse group of lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteochondrodysplasias</z:e> characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002983'>micromelia</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003521'>short trunk</z:hpo>, and a disproportionately large cranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases of classic achondrogenesis Type I (Parenti-Fraccaro), and classic achondrogenesis Type II (Langer-Saldino) have been grouped on the basis of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> has been proposed, broad acceptance has been lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Review of 79 cases, including examination of available radiographs of familial cases, permitted division into four radiographic prototypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases were distinguished on the basis of specific skeletal features as well as a new parameter, the "femoral cylinder index" (CIfemur) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using these criteria, the affected siblings in 11 families were found to be concordant for prototype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, identification of radiographic skeletal prototypes of achondrogenesis, and the observation of familial concordance for prototype, suggested the existence of at least four genetically distinct disorders, each having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations should provide further impetus for histopathologic and biochemical studies of the defects in achondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
