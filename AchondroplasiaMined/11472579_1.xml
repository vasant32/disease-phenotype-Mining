<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the developmental course of the phenotype (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> and skeletal characteristics) has not been clarified in the genotyped population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationship between age and clinical data (height, arm span and measurements of skeletal radiographs) were statistically analyzed from 27 achondroplasia patients with the G380R genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The height standard deviation score had positive correlation and decreased with age, while span-to-height ratio did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among measurements of skeletal radiographs, the pelvic index, which represents the squared pelvis deformity, were correlated and increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, interpedicular distance of the first and fourth lumbar vertebrae (L1:L4) ratio as an index for the caudally narrowed pattern of the lumbar spinal canal and fibula-to-tibia ratio for the disproportionally long fibulae were not correlated and did not increase with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In making a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in early infancy, it should be noted that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> and squared pelvis deformity are not prominent </plain></SENT>
