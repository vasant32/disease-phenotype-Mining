<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overnight sleep studies (11 subjects) and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP's, 10 subjects) were recorded before and after conventional treatment of OSA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two groups were derived from 30 subjects who underwent diagnostic sleep studies and SEPs, including 15 females and 15 males with a median age 6.6 years (range 1.0-47.6) at the time of the first study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 30 initial studies there was no correlation between severity of OSA and abnormalities on SEP evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment of 17 subjects included adenotonsillectomy (n = 3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (n = 1), and nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sleep studies in 11 subjects after a delay of 8.8 +/- 2.8 months showed a reduction in respiratory disturbance index (RDI) from 38.4 +/- 6.9 to 6.5 +/- 1.8 events hr(-1) (p &lt; 0.001) and movements/arousals fell from 10.4 +/- 2.2 to 4.8 +/- 0.2 hr(-1) (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Obstructive events were reduced from 33.7 +/- 6.9 to 2.4 +/- 1.0 hr(-1) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement of respiratory indices was associated with an increased proportion of slow-wave sleep from 25.2 +/- 4.0% to 32.3 +/- 2.4% (p = 0.01), and decrease in stage 1-2 sleep from 59.3 +/- 5.8% to 46.6 +/- 1.9% (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in the percentage of REM sleep (15.2 to 21.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeat SEP studies in 10 subjects, after clinically effective treatment of OSA, showed improvement of SEP score of at least 1 grade, in 5 of 7 (71%) with initially abnormal values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that treatment of relieve <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> improves OSA in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, accompanied by changes in sleep structure and, in some cases, improved studies of neurological function </plain></SENT>
