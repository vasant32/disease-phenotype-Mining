<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> labeling index of proliferating zone chondrocytes from both mutants was below that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The generation time of Dw/Dw animals was longer than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (greater than 24 vs. 17 hours respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inasmuch as the medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, which presumably contains somatomedin, these data suggest that the Dw/Dw mutant cannot be considered simply a model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000839'>pituitary dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pituitary fibroblast growth factor (FGF), 50ng/ml, decreased the labeling index of chondrocytes from both Dw/Dw and ac/ac animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus neither a lack of FGF nor an end-organ non-responsiveness to this factor seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of either growth disturbance </plain></SENT>
