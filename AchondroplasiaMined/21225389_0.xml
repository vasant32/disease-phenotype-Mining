<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We are reporting the first case of a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> and hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this patient, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> was clinically recognised and confirmed by the cytogenetic finding of mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+21/46,XX) shortly after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, stocky habitus and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overlapping common clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> and hypochondroplasia resulted in delayed diagnosis of hypochondroplasia in our patient and the associated deleterious effect on her linear growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her final height is 126.5 cm, which is -3.76 standard deviations (SD) lower than the median height in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, and is under the lower borderline of the adult height range for women with hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
