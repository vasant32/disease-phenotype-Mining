<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is one of the most common forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short limb dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is usually suspected on third trimester routine ultrasound because of very shortened long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have described two new prenatal sonographic signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> visible at the proximal femoral metaphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over 5 years, five fetuses were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> at the Grenoble Prenatal Diagnosis Centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound and tomographic examinations were performed by specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study the proximal metaphysis, the ultrasound transducer was positioned at a 45 degree angle to the diaphyseal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postnatal diagnosis was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On computed tomography and postnatal X-ray, proximal femoral metaphysis appeared rounded, with poor, uneven ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Connexion to diaphysis was abnormal, with relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the periosteum, creating a new diagnostic sign that we called the 'collar hoop' sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On ultrasound, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fetuses had a very rounded metaphyseal-epiphyseal interface, with an angle connexion to diaphysis wider than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 'collar hoop' sign was obvious on four of the fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the same period, proximal femoral metaphyses appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 653 healthy fetuses, suggesting high specificity of those two new signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Metaphysis examination is recommended if fetal femur length measures below the fifth percentile, as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> aspect may rule out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
