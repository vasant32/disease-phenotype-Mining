<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have used both methods since 1977 and carried out 22 distraction epiphyseolyses (20 patients) and 33 corticotomies (28 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average lengthening distance was 8.25 cm and 7.8 cm respectively (minimum 4 cm, maximum 18 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time per cm lengthening (lengthening index) was 45.8 days/cm for epiphyseolysis and 52.2 days/cm for corticotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complication rates were similar in both methods (1.18 and 1.21 pro lengthening procedure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both techniques are preferably performed by a well trained team of physicians, nurses and physiotherapists for correction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leg length discrepancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
