<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> and cervicomedullary compression in infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> has been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prospective clinical and imaging evaluations have been recommended to identify those infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who are at risk of dying suddenly from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> secondary to unrecognized cervicomedullary compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since 1988, we have prospectively evaluated 11 infants (average age 13 weeks) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who were asymptomatic for cervicomedullary compression on initial clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings included narrowing of the foramen magnum, effacement of the subarachnoid spaces at the cervicomedullary junction, abnormal intrinsic cord signal intensity and mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> underwent immediate decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed opisthotonic posturing within 3 months of evaluation and underwent foramen magnum decompression, including suboccipital craniectomy and atlantal laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases revealed forward extension of the squamous portion of the occipital bone, thickened posterior rim of the foramen magnum and a dense fibrotic epidural band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no complications from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients did not require surgery and were followed closely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 11 patients remain asymptomatic at follow-up (mean 4.6 years; range 16 months to 7.3 years), and no patient has required a diversionary shunt procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this prospective study confirm that early clinical and MRI evaluations are necessary to determine whether infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> have cervicomedullary compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With early recognition, an immediate decompression can be performed safely to avoid serious complications associated with cervicomedullary compression, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
