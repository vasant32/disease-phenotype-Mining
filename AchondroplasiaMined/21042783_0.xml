<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to further characterize this entity, we studied 32 clinically and radiographically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patients, among 19 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COMP and collagen (Col) IX (A1, A2 and A3) mutations, were determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes were characterized according to height deviation (cm) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, lower extremity mechanical axis deviation (MAD), cervical and thoracolumbar spine involvement, pelvic index, as well as hip, knee, ankle and hand involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report an 81% mutation detection rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>, of which COMP+Col9A3 mutations were more prevalent (61%) than COMP mutations alone (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patients, 19% tested negative for both COMP and Col9A3 mutations, and they presented with the greatest mean height deviations, but the least mean MADs </plain></SENT>
