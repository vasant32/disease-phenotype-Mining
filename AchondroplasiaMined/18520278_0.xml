<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: During the period from 1985 to 2006, 22 children (44 hips) affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were ultrasonographically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients' age at examination ranged from 7 days to 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hip ultrasound (US) examination was performed, according to Graf's method, using a Siemens Sonoline sonogram with linear 5.0- and 7.5-MHz probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the hips, the alpha angle was impossible to be measured because the medial margin of the ilium was not ultrasonographically detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonographic findings included the following: configuration of the acetabular bony rim, configuration of the acetabular roof, echogenicity of the head and acetabular cartilage, bony coverage percentage of the femoral head according to Morin et al, beta angle according to Graf, dynamic hip instability, and presence of the proximal femoral ossific nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hips had a sharp acetabular bony rim, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003180'>horizontal acetabular roof</z:hpo>, thickened acetabular cartilage, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> echogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The femoral head was well centered and deeply contained in the acetabular fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean coverage was 86.7% (range: 78%-90%) and showed progressively larger values with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean value of the beta angle was 20 degrees (range: 8 degrees-38 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The value of the beta angle tended to decrease as age increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between the right and the left hip in both measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> hips were stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ossific nucleus was present in 5 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic findings in hip ultrasonography in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> can aid in its early diagnosis because ultrasound can anatomically detect the altered development of the achondroplastic acetabulum </plain></SENT>
