<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1971 and 1979, laminectomy was performed on three patients with thoracolumbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal canal stenosis</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous spondylodesis using Harrington instrumentation in conjunction with extensive laminectomy was performed in the most recent case, and excellent results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We emphasize, therefore, that neurological deficit caused by kyphotic deformity and instability secondary to extensive laminectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> can be prevented by this procedure, and thus good results can be anticipated </plain></SENT>
