<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An attempt was made to ascertain <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the dwarfs in the State of Victoria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> proved to be approximately 1 in 26,000 live births in the period 1969 to 1975 when ascertainment was nearly complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This indicates a mutation rate of 1.93 X 10(-5) per generation in this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paternal age was shown to influence mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ascertainment in earlier years of the study was low despite the very great effort made to find <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with hypochondroplasia were particularly difficult to find </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 25 cases were found for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overlap between hypochondroplasia and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features except the facial appearance (which was the basis of definition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> was more severe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regards, but some individuals with hypochondroplasia were very short and some had extreme degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal canal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The classical measurements used to describe the skull changes in acondroplasia failed to distinguish this condition from hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More efficient indices were devised, but visual assessment of the size of the facial region compared to that of the cranial valult proved more reliable than any index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical distinction based upon facial appearance remains the arbitrary basis of definition </plain></SENT>
