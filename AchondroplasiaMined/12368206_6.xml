<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3) and Indian hedgehog (IHH)/parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> receptor type 1 (PTHR1) systems are both essential regulators of endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on mouse models, activation of the FGFR3 system is suggested to regulate the IHH/PTHR1 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To challenge this possible interaction in humans, we analyzed the femoral growth plates from fetuses carrying activating FGFR3 mutations (9 achondroplasia, 21 and 8 thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> types 1 and 2, respectively) and 14 age-matched controls by histological techniques and in situ hybridization using riboprobes for human IHH, PTHR1, type 10 and type 1 collagen transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that bone-perichondrial ring enlargement and growth plate increased vascularization in FGFR3-mutated fetuses correlate with the phenotypic severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PTHR1 and IHH expression in growth plates, bone-perichondrial rings and vascular canals is not affected by FGFR3 mutations, irrespective of the mutant genotype and age, and is in keeping with <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that in humans, FGFR3 signaling does not down-regulate the main players of the IHH/PTHR1 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that cells within the bone-perichondrial ring in controls and patients express IHH, PTHR1, and type 10 and type 1 collagen transcripts, suggesting that bone-perichondrial ring formation involves cells of both chondrocytic and osteoblastic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
