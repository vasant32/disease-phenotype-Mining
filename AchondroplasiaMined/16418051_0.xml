<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anthopometrics and skeletal features are very similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> but milder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy per cent of affected individuals are heterozygous for a mutation of the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in some anthropometric measurements in affected patients with and without N540K mutation were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the disease was made on the presence of previously standardized criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000547'>short limbs</z:mp> and three or more X-ray features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification of exons 10, 13 and 15 of FGFR3 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were studied (median age was 7.31, range 0.27-20.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sitting height, body proportions and head circumference (HC) were statistically different in the mutated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out in order to estimate the discriminating power of different cut-off points of HC for recognizing patients with and without the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A figure of 1.86 SD for HC was found to have a sensitivity of 73.3% and specificity of 100% for detecting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> patients with the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had a HC greater than 1.86?SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results contribute to a better characterization of the clinical-molecular relationships in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
