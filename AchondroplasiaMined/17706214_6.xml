<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Studies in sperm and testis biopsy DNA according to donor's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): Seventeen donors aged 30 to 65 years for sperm collection and 14 deceased donors aged 53 to 95 years for testis biopsies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): Testes were obtained from 14 deceased donors, and sperm was obtained from 17 patients who requested ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of the G1138A mutation in sperm and testis biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): The rate of G1138A mutation did not significantly vary with age in sperm, whereas in testis biopsies it increased markedly past the age of 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, and for the first time, a mosaic for this mutation was detected in the testis of three subjects who were &gt;80 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): These findings could contribute to providing a molecular explanation for the increased incidence of achondroplastic offspring with advanced paternal age </plain></SENT>
