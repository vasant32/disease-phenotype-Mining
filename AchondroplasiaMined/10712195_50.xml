<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the parental origin of these FGFR2 mutations, the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ARMS PCR primers were developed to recognize polymorphisms that could distinguish maternal and paternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 4,374 bases between introns IIIa and 11 of the FGFR2 gene were sequenced and were assayed by heteroduplex analysis, to identify polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two polymorphisms (1333TA/TATA and 2710 C/T) were found and were used with two previously described polymorphisms, to screen a total of 41 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of these families were shown to be informative (11 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and 11 for Pfeiffer syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven different mutations in the 22 families were detected by either restriction digest or allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization of ARMS PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We molecularly proved the origin of these different mutations to be paternal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative cases analyzed (P=2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4x10-7; 95% confidence limits 87%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advanced paternal age was noted for the fathers of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> or Pfeiffer syndrome, compared with the fathers of control individuals (34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>50+/-7.65 years vs. 30.45+/-1.28 years, P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data on advanced paternal age corroborates and extends previous clinical evidence based on statistical analyses as well as additional reports of advanced paternal age associated with paternal origin of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (FGFR2) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (FGFR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that older men either have accumulated or are more susceptible to a variety of germline mutations </plain></SENT>
