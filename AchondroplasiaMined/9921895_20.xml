<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two disorders were in the past considered to be distinct clinical entities; however, recent studies have proven that both diseases can result from mutations of the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize further COMP mutations and investigate phenotype-genotype relationships, we screened this gene in 15 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> or MED by directly sequencing polymerase chain reaction products from genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified ten mutations involving conserved residues among the eight calmodulin-like repeats of the gene product: seven were novel missense mutations in exons 9, 10, 11, 13 or 14, and the other three resulted from deletion of one of the five GAC repeats in exon 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that the GAC repeats in the 7th calmodulin-like repeat in exon 13 represent a hot-spot for mutation, and that mutations in the 7th calmodulin-like repeat produce severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> phenotypes while mutations elsewhere in the gene exhibit mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> or MED phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These genotype-phenotype correlations may facilitate molecular diagnosis and classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and MED, and provide insight into the relationship between structure and function of the COMP gene product </plain></SENT>
