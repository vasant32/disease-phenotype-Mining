<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1996 sixteen patients were treated surgically because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> (11 male and 5 female) at the age of 9 to 29 years (mean 15.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in 6 patients was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, 2 - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ellis van Creveld</z:e>, 2 - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014084" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ollier disease</z:e>, 1 - <z:hpo ids='HP_0002657'>spondylometaphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo>, 1 - <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, 1 - <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> and constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> - in other 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pre-operative height ranged between 103 cm to 155 cm (mean 125) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>12 patients were treated by the crossing method, means in one stage lengthening of the femur and the tibia of the contralateral limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 4 cases lengthening and improvement of body proportion was achieved by lower leg lengthening only (one of them lengthened twice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases treated with the crossing method complete procedure was finished, in other 3 - only the first stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the planed segmental lengthening was achieved except one tibial segment in the most older patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Achieved height increase ranged from 8 to 20 cm (mean 13.8), on femur level 6 to 10 cm (mean 8.3) while on tibia level 2 to 10.5 cm (mean 7.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lengthening index for the single segment ranged from 0.6 to 4.7 months/cm (mean 1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COMPLICATIONS: Severe limitation of knee joint range of motion (up to 50 degrees) needs quadriceps plasty in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Residual valgus deformity of the tibia in one case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ellis van Creveld</z:e> needs corrective osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal bony re-generate of the tibia in the oldest patient did not allows achieving the planed lengthening and leads to increasing the lengthening index up to 3 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increasing the height with Ilizarov method is effective however the treatment time is long, requiring strict patients cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk of complications should makes the qualification to this treatment careful and precise </plain></SENT>
