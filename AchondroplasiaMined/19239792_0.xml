<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disturbance is present in growth plates at correct ossifying bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, most cases are the result of new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is a distinctive condition that is usually noted at birth, but worsening is observed with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main criteria of division of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> are x-ray and genetic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: Elaboration of percentile graph of growth prediction for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the research, 134 children at the age from 0 to 18 years and also adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (under IP-CZD control) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group contained 75 men and 59 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because of a small number of patients, the individual observations have been taken as a cross-sectional data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric measurements have been taken by skilled staff in Anthropology Lab in Dept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Paediatrics of The Children's Memorial Health Institute according to Pozna≈Ñ norms applying to a reference system for children and young people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following percentiles: minimum, maximum, median and quartiles (25% and 75%) were calculated in age groups for normalized stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further the use of inverted transformation enables the calculation of prediction graphs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The verification of the method was confirmed by the observation that the stature of 9 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (5 boys and 4 girls) have been correctly placed on the graphs </plain></SENT>
