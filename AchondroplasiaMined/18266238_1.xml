<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three sibs shared the paternal allele and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carried the same causal mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3): G &gt; A nt1138 (Gly380Arg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were able to identify this mutation on sperm DNA confirming paternal germinal mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our family shows that a more precise definition of the recurrence risk is feasible using this approach, based on a single DNA test, which could be offered in selected cases </plain></SENT>
