<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may have deleterious consequences including the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> or, when occurring in somatic tissues, may participate in the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar to many mutational hotspots, the G1138A mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene occurs at a CpG site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In germ-line tissues, the G1138A mutation results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and has one of the highest spontaneous mutation rates in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although not at the G1138A site, there are increased rates of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the FGFR3 gene that have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cases associated with a translocation, t (4; 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chromosome-4 break points in this translocation are clustered in a 70-kb region centromeric to the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this translocation may impact the mutation rate at the G1138A site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We employed a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based assay to measure the frequency of this mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines carrying t (4; 14) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of these cell lines varied from no change to a 10-fold increase in the mutation frequency compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In general, there was an increase in the G1138A mutational frequency suggesting that chromosomal rearrangement can affect the stability of the CpG hotspots </plain></SENT>
