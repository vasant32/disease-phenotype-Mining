<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the COMP gene cause two dominantly inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia</z:hpo> (MED/EDM1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a novel point mutation D511Y in the seventh calcium-binding repeat of the COMP gene and the resulting iliac crest growth plate pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> iliac crest growth plate is comprised of a large region of resting chondrocytes above a narrow region composed of clusters of disorganized proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chondrocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> zones show massive intracellular retention of COMP and the surrounding extracellular matrix is deficient in COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the 511Y COMP mutation selectively affects type IX collagen as little is found in the growth plate matrix whereas type II collagen and aggrecan are abundant in the matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chondrocyte remnants are observed in the chondrocyte clusters and dead cells are found throughout the growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> studies demonstrate an unusual pattern of TUNEL staining in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> chondrocytes compared to the control growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These in vivo findings support our previous observation that retention of COMP leads to chondrocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results also add to the increasing evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and EDM1 are rER <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage diseases</z:e> and that impaired linear growth and joint <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> are caused by the disruptive effect of massive amounts of COMP within the chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
