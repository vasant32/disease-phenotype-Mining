<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of fathers of affected persons has been found to be greater than expected for several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> diseases due to new mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the clinical importance of this observation, the relative and absolute frequencies of offspring with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> diseases due to mutation in the sperm from fathers of various ages have been calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mutations in children increases logarithmically with paternal age during the usual years of fatherhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absolute frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disease due to new mutations among the offspring of fathers who are 40 years of age or older is estimated to be at least 0.3 to 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This risk is many times greater than that for children of young fathers and is similar in magnitude to the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> among the offspring of 35- to 40-year-old mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is good public health policy to recommend that both men and women complete their family a before age 40, if possible </plain></SENT>
