<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its receptor (FGFR) are thought to be negative regulators of chondrocytic growth, as exemplified by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and related <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp>, which are caused by constitutively active mutations in FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To understand the growth-inhibitory mechanisms of FGF, we analyzed the effects of FGF2 on cell cycle-regulating molecules in chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FGF2 dramatically inhibited proliferation of rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0006765'>chondrosarcoma</z:hpo> (RCS) cells and arrested their cell cycle at the G(1) phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FGF2 increased p21 expression in RCS cells, which assembled with the cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, although the expression of neither cyclin E nor Cdk2 increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated cyclin E or Cdk2, assessed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo> protein (pRb) as substrate, was dramatically reduced by FGF-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FGF2 shifted pRb to its underphosphorylated, active form in RCS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FGF2 not only induced p21 protein expression in proliferating chondrocytes in mouse fetal limbs cultured in vitro but also decreased their proliferation as assessed by the expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, a marker for cells in S phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, inhibitory effects of FGF2 on chondrocytic proliferation were partially reduced in p21-null limbs, compared with those in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> limbs in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, FGF's growth inhibitory effects of chondrocytes appear to be mediated at least partially through p21 induction and the subsequent inactivation of cyclin E-Cdk2 and activation of pRb </plain></SENT>
