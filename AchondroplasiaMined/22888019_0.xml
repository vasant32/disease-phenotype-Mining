<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are both caused by activating mutations in FGFR3 and are inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our patient was born to parents with presumed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and found on prenatal testing to have p.G380R and p.N540K FGFR3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to having typical problems associated with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and hypochondroplasia, our patient had several atypical findings including: abnormal lobulation of the lungs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo>, C1 stenosis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> following a Nissen fundoplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After his reflux and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> were treated, the persistence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002789'>tachypnea</z:hpo> and increased respiratory effort indicated this was not the primary source of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our subsequent hypothesis was that primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002091'>restrictive lung disease</z:hpo> was the cause of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A closer examination of his chest circumference did not support this conclusion either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, an autopsy found the right lung had 2 lobes while the left lung had 3 lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A literature review demonstrates that other children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-hypochondroplasia complex have been described with abnormal pulmonary function and infants with thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> have similar abnormal pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that there may be a primary pulmonary phenotype associated with FGFR3-opathies, unrelated to chest size which leads to the consistent finding of increased respiratory signs and symptoms in these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further observation of respiratory status, combined with the macroscopic and microscopic analysis of pulmonary branching <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and alveolar structure in this patient population will be important to explore this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
