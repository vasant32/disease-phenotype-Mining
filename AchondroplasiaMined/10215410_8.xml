<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> have been mapped to fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For hypochondroplasia, two point mutations, both responsible for the Asn540Lys substitution in the region coding the tyrosine kinase domain have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report an A to G transition at position 1651, predicting an Ile538Val substitution in the FGFR3, in hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The substitution is found in a swedish family with three affected members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The criteria for hypochondroplasia were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> and radiological evidence of shortened long bones and decrease or absence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> increase in interpedicular distances of the lumbar column </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation was detected by direct sequencing and restriction enzyme Tai I digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The base change was not found in the FGFR3 genes of unaffected members of the family nor in seventy-five unrelated unaffected individuals, suggesting that it was not a polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Ile538Val substitution is a conservative amino acid change (a hydrophobic amino acid incorporated for another hydrophobic amino acid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is located in the stretch of nine amino acids, which is highly conserved among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the human fibroblast growth factor receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Considering the location of this substitution and the segregation with the phenotype in this family, we propose that it is a causative mutation of hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to establish whether the Ile538Val substitution is rare in hypochondroplasia patients or whether the individuals, who have a moderate degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, rarely seek medical help for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> and consequently are rarely diagnosed as affected by hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
