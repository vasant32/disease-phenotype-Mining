<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present the results of total knee replacement in a 66-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings; molecular genetic examination confirmed that the patient was heterozygous for the G1138A mutation responsible for substitution of an arginine for a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29947">glycine residue</z:chebi> at position 380 (G380R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with an unusual finding of severe fixed 20-degree valgus deformity, so far not published, which did not conform with the clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors presumed that the deformity had developed due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100555'>asymmetric growth</z:hpo> of the distal femoral diaphysis resulting in a hypoplastic lateral femoral condyle and, consequently, valgus deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They put emphasis on thorough pre-operative radiography in order to define the size of components according to the templates, and on measurement of the valgus angle and femoral mechanical axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also drew attention to the problem of an extra-articular tibial alignment guide and recommended the use of its alternative or computer navigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgery restored the mechanical axis, range of motion and stability of the knee, relieved pain and improved walking, which afforded a better quality of life for the patient </plain></SENT>
