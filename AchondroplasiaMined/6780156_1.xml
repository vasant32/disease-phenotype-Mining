<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and degeneration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> zones of growth cartilage, but the cells and matrix of the hypertrophic zone were the most severely affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural changes of the hypertrophic chondrocytes consisted of alteration of the cytoplasmic contents and of the intercellular matrix; the cell membrane was smooth and without cytoplasmic extensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasm was filled with dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum, vacuoles of varying sizes and contents, and lipidlike bodies with electron-dense granules; mineral crystals, collagen, and degenerating mitochondria were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The matrix showed only spotty calcification and a reduced number of dense bodies, vesicles, and granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cells appeared to have failed to exteriorize cell products across the plasmalemma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure to exteriorize cell products and to form cytoplasmic processes reduced the number of potential nucleation sites for calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructure of osteocytes was much less affected </plain></SENT>
