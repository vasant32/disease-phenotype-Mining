<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fgfr3 gain-of-function mutations cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, and a spectrum of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite a significant number of studies on the role of FGFR3 in cartilage, to date, none has investigated the influence of Fgfr3-mediated effects of the growth plate on bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied three mouse models, each expressing Fgfr3 mutation either ubiquitously (CMV-Fgfr3(Y367C/+)), in chondrocytes (Col II-Fgfr3(Y367C/+)) or in mature osteoblasts (Col I-Fgfr3(Y367C/+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> with a significant defect in bone formation during growth was only observed in mouse models expressing mutant Fgfr3 in the cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a dramatic reduction in cartilage matrix mineralization and a strong defect of primary spongiosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anomalies of primary spongiosa were associated with an increase in osteoclast recruitment and a defect of osteoblasts at the mineralization front </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in bone volume, trabecular thickness and number was also observed in the trabecular bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no anomalies in proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblasts from CMV-Fgfr3(Y367C/+) mice were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we excluded a potential function of Fgfr3 directly on osteoblasts at 3 weeks of age and we obtained evidence that the disorganization of the growth plate is responsible for the anomalies of the trabecular bone during bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Herein, we propose that impaired FGFR3 signaling pathways may affect trabecular bone formation via a paracrine mechanism during growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results redefine our understanding of endochondral ossification in FGFR3-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
