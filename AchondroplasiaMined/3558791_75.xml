<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a dynamic axial fixator with telescoping capabilities, distraction begins after 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the required length is attained, the fixator is held in the rigid mode until radiographic evidence of callus is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The locking screw is then released, and dynamic axial loading is instituted to promote corticalization </plain></SENT>
