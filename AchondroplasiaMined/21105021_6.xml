<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To improve the prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> by constructing charts of fetal size, defining frequency of sonographic features and exploring the role of non-invasive molecular diagnosis based on cell-free fetal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) in maternal plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on fetuses with a confirmed diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were obtained from our databases, records reviewed, sonographic features and measurements determined and charts of fetal size constructed using the LMS (lambda-mu-sigma) method and compared with charts used in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases referred to our regional genetics laboratory for molecular diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA were identified and results reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six cases were scanned in our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetal size charts showed that femur length was usually on or below the 3(rd) centile by 25 weeks' gestation, and always below the 3(rd) by 30 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Head circumference was above the 50(th) centile, increasing to above the 95(th) when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for the majority of fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abdominal circumference was also increased but to a lesser extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Commonly reported sonographic features were bowing of the femora, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009803'>short fingers</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005257'>small chest</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA in six pregnancies confirmed the presence of the c.1138G &gt; A mutation in the FGRF3 gene in four cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, but not the two subsequently found to be growth restricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data should improve the accuracy of diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> based on sonographic findings, and have implications for targeted molecular confirmation that can reliably and safely be carried out using cell-free fetal DNA </plain></SENT>
