<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though abnormalities of bone growth are the major clinical manifestations, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> may involve in any body system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many of these disorders have dire consequences such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo> and most will have life-long physical and psychosocial morbidity associated with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in genetic research have identified the genes underlying the primary defects in several common <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and diastrophic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While these advances are clearly important in developing better therapy and a cure for those conditions, the role of the pediatrician as the diagnostician has remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this article we describe how a systematic approach using the simplest of tools--clinical assessment and radiograph--can arrive at a diagnosis in most instances of newborns with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The key features that are essential for establishing a diagnosis for most of the entities encountered in the newborn are described along with our general approach to the evaluation of the radiographs </plain></SENT>
