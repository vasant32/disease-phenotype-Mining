<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in body weight and dry weight of femora, tibiae, humeri, and unlae, and in the length of tibiae, unlae, and humeri became more marked with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the biochemical assays carried out, only those for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> disclosed significant differences between dwarfs and non-dwarfs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dwarfs having higher levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi>, and most of them having higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> levels than the non-dwarfs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically, no distinction could be made between growth zones of non-dwarfs, of cn/+, or +/+ genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the dwarfs, two groups differing as to the severity of the skeletal abnormality could be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences between dwarfs were most marked in the growth zones of tibiae and femora, less conspicuous in those of vertebrae and least pronounced at the chondro-osseous junction of the ribs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause or causes of the histologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> remain unknown </plain></SENT>
