<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> in a large population of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and to evaluate the effectiveness of adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy as treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of 95 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (38%) had clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients underwent surgery, with more than 1 procedure required in 10 children (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adenotonsillectomy was the initial procedure for 22 of 34 patients, and further therapy was required in only 18% of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adenoidectomy was the initial procedure for 10 of 34, with 90% requiring further surgery for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tonsillectomy alone was performed in 2 patients: 1 was effectively treated and 1 later required adenoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endotracheal intubation was accomplished in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without complication; 53% required a smaller endotracheal tube than would be predicted by their age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight postoperative complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> is very common in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgery is effective, but recurrent symptoms are common, particularly when the initial procedure is adenoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The complication rate is higher than that observed in a general pediatric population but is readily managed with standard therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia can be given safely to these patients with special consideration for limited neck extension and appropriate endotracheal tube size </plain></SENT>
