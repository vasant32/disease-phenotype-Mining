<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its expansion by one repeat causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo>, while expansion by two repeats or, remarkably, deletion of one repeat causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we used CD spectroscopy, PAGE and UV absorption spectroscopy to compare conformational properties of the DNA strands containing four, five, six and seven repeats of the GAC trinucleotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The (GAC)n strands were found to form four distinct ordered conformations, depending on the solution conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first was a foldback, stable at slightly alkaline pH values and low and medium ionic strengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing salt concentration induced a transition of the foldback into an antiparallel right-handed homoduplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the conformers contained the Watson-Crick G.C pairs while the intervening <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenines</z:chebi> contributed little to their B-like conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the strands associated into a parallel homoduplex stabilized by the hemiprotonated C+.C pairs and by the GpA steps that both favor the parallel DNA strand orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The parallel homoduplex was stable even at neutral pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fourth conformation was the left-handed Z-DNA, which formed easier with (GAC)n than with (GC)n of comparable length, indicating that the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenines</z:chebi> of (GAC)n promoted the left-handed duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The paper shows that stability of the above four conformers strongly depends on the GAC repeat number </plain></SENT>
