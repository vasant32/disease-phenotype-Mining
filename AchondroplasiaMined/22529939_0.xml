<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two mutations in FGFR3, G380R and G375C are known to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The G380R mutation accounts for 98% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> cases, and thus has been studied extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we study the effect of the G375C mutation on the phosphorylation and the cross-linking propensity of full-length FGFR3 in HEK 293 cells, and we compare the results to previously published results for the G380R mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observe identical behavior of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> mutants in these experiments, a finding which supports a direct link between the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> phenotypes and the level and mechanism of FGFR3 over-activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutations do not increase the cross-linking propensity of FGFR3, contrary to previous expectations that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> mutations stabilize the FGFR3 dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, the phosphorylation efficiency within un-liganded FGFR3 dimers is increased, and this increase is likely the underlying cause for pathogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further investigate the G346E mutation, which has been reported to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We find that this mutation does not increase FGFR3 phosphorylation and decreases FGFR3 cross-linking propensity, a finding which raises questions whether this mutation is indeed a genetic cause for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
