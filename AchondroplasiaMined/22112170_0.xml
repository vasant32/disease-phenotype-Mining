<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is the most common form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteochondrodysplasia</z:e> and is associated with a number of life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The complexity of the condition led to the development of Heath Supervision Guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1995 and revised in 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There remains limited population-based information on utilisation of medical and therapy services for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased information regarding use of these services will assist in future service development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data regarding frequency and timing of medical and allied health consultations, investigations and interventions were collected from 53 Australasian families via questionnaire, based on recommendations of the Health Supervision Guidelines, an expert reference group and literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rates varied with age for medical consultations (geneticist, paediatric rehabilitation physician/paediatrician, respiratory physician, orthopaedic consultant, neurologist, neurosurgeon), medical investigations (sleep study, magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography), operative procedures (brain-stem decompression, tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, shunt insertion, shunt revision and insertion of grommets) and allied health consultations (physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech pathologist, dietician and orthotist) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Access to geneticists and paediatricians within the first year is high as recommended by the 2005 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Utilisation of craniocervical magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography, polysomnography studies and formal speech review appears low, reflecting more emphasis on clinical monitoring for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002341'>cervical cord compression</z:hpo> and disordered sleep breathing as well as possible difficulties in accessing services for polysomnography and speech pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grommet insertion, tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy and cervicomedullary decompression rates are similar to results reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over half of the children accessed physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy services, warranting consideration of these professionals in future guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
