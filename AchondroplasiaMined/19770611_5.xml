<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the period prevalence and predisposing factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> progression (TLK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: TLK is a common presentation in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This condition occurs very early in life; it is observed during the first attempts to sit, and has multifactorial etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies are limited on the radiologic assessment of the angle of wedging of the deformed vertebra, but none to our knowledge on TLK progression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 48 of 103 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> seen between 1997 and 2005 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>motor delay</z:hpo> (DMD) and other potential predictors of TLK were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The criteria for DMD were a child's inability to sit without support by 6 months and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002540'>inability to walk</z:hpo> independently by 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lateral radiographs were examined for the magnitude of TLK, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo>, percentage of apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0008422'>vertebral wedging</z:hpo> for the height and width of the vertebra, and apical vertebral translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association between TLK progression and potential predisposing factors were assessed using chi test, Fisher exact, t test, and binomial regression model for predictor identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The period prevalence of TLK progression in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was 35.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TLK progression was significantly related to DMD, risk ratio = 2.40, 95% confidence interval = 1.10 to 5.58, apical vertebral translation (P = 0.01), and percentage apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0008422'>vertebral wedging</z:hpo> for height (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for relevant covariates, the relationship between DMD and TLK progression persisted, risk ratio = 2.65, 95% confidence interval, 1.20 to 5.91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DMD was significantly associated with TLK progression and other radiologic parameters namely, initial TLK of &gt;25 degrees , percentage of apical <z:hpo ids='HP_0008422'>vertebral wedging</z:hpo> for the height of the vertebra, and apical vertebral translation </plain></SENT>
