<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> (SDB), sleep architecture, and arousal pattern in infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and to evaluate the relationship between foramen magnum size and the severity of SDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of polysomnographic recordings and medical records was performed in infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and in aged-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were re-scored with the emphasis on respiratory events, sleep state, and arousals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the neuroimaging study of the brain (magnetic resonance imaging) was reviewed to evaluate foramen magnum diameters and to assess their relationship to SDB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four infants met the criteria for entry into analysis, 12 infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (A) and 12 control infants (C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in age or sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had a significant increase in total respiratory disturbance index (RDI; A, 13.9 +/- 10.8 versus C, 2.0 +/- 0.9; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in percentages of active sleep, quiet sleep, or sleep efficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of arousals demonstrated that infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had a significant decrease in both spontaneous arousal index (A, 10.5 +/- 3.5/hr versus C, 18.6 +/- 2.7; P &lt; .0001) and respiratory arousals (A, 10.3% +/- 6.3% versus C, 27.5 +/- 9.5%; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of foramen magnum dimensions demonstrated smaller foramen magnum size, but there were no significant correlations between anteroposterior or transverse diameters and RDI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> have significant SDB during early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SDB in infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is not associated with alteration in sleep architecture, possibly because of attenuation of the arousal response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the concomitant increased apneic events and decreased arousal response will lead to vulnerability in these infants and may underlie the pathophysiologic mechanism of sudden unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this population </plain></SENT>
