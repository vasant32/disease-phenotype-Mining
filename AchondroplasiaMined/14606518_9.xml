<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine the effects of IGF-1, which is an important mediator of GH, on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we analyzed a chondrogenic cell line expressing the FGFR3 mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our findings that IGF-1 prevented the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through PI3K and MAPK pathways may explain how GH treatment improves the disturbed bone growth in ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH), which is caused by a point mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene in the transmembrane domain (G380R), is one of the most common genetic forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, using a chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5, we have showed that the constitutively active FGFR3 mutants induced an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also reported that growth hormone (GH) treatment increased the growth rate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in parallel with the increment of serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, suggesting an important role of IGF-1 in skeletal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, to clarify the mechanism by which GH treatment improved the phenotype of ACH patients, we examined the possible effects of IGF-1 on an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by FGFR3 mutant in ATDC5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using adenovirus vector, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> or mutant FGFR3 (G380R) was introduced into ATDC5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was estimated by TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes and activation of signaling molecules were analyzed by immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay showed that the cell number was reduced in ATDC5 cells expressing the mutant FGFR3 (G380R; ATDC5-mtR3 cells), suggesting that ATDC5-mtR3 cells might fall into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>IGF-1, which is an important mediator of GH, restored cell proliferation and <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>reduced apoptosis</z:mp> in ATDC5-mtR3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IGF-1 also decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To investigate which signaling cascade is responsible for antiapoptotic effects of IGF-1, we examined the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAPK in ATDC5-mtR3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Specific inhibitors of PI3K or MAPK blocked the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-1 in ATDC5-mtR3 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, showing IGF-1 prevents the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by FGFR3 mutation through the PI3K pathway and MAPK pathway, explain the mechanisms by which GH treatment improves the disturbed bone growth in ACH </plain></SENT>
