<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients selected for evaluation included pediatric patients who underwent T1 and T2 or dual-echo, proton-density axial T1- and T2-weighted and T1 sagittal brain MRI during 1988 to 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study subjects (n = 11) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> by clinical and radiologic criteria and compared to an age- and gender-matched control group (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four predetermined ventricular and brain parenchymal dimensions and area calculations were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using two-tailed t tests, chi-squared analysis, ANOVA, and ANCOVA, adjusting for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlational analyses with respect to subject type and age were done separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 36 patients (11 subjects with 15 MRI examinations, mean age 2.3 years, and 25 controls with 26 MRI examinations, mean age 3.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences existed for 11/17 measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Achondroplasts had a significantly larger bifrontal width (p &lt; 0.0001), bicaudate width (p &lt; 0.0001), frontal horn diagonal length (p &lt; 0.05), biatrial width (p &lt; 0.0001), biparietal diameter (p &lt; 0.05), and iter to incisural line distance (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Achondroplasts had significantly smaller frontal lobe depths (p &lt; 0.01), optic tract angles (p &lt; 0.0001), foramen magnum diameters (p &lt; 0.0001), and sinojugular transition zones (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in brainstem heights or fourth ventricular widths between achondroplasts and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, with respect to age, frontal lobe depth was smaller when compared to controls and the descending sigmoid sinus area became increasingly larger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Achondroplastic subjects experience dynamic changes in brain morphometry resulting in a rostral displacement of the brainstem with gradual compression of the frontal lobes due to enlargement of the supratentorial ventricular spaces commensurate with an increase in venous sinus distension </plain></SENT>
