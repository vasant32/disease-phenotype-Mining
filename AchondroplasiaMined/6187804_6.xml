<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our experiments indicate that a) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> with different contents of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> and keratan <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, prepared under nondegradative conditions, are not distinguishable on the basis of the critical electrolyte concentrations at which staining is abolished; b) the state of aggregation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> only very slightly affects the alcian blue affinity of the macromolecules at different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="6636">magnesium chloride</z:chebi>; c) the interaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> with other components of the connective tissue matrix is an important factor in determining the strength of binding of alcian blue to the polyanionic macromolecules in histological sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These factors should be considered in interpreting histochemical data obtained by staining tissue sections with alcian blue at different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="6636">magnesium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
