<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>Dwarfism</z:hpo> is the most obvious skeletal manifestation, but most people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> do not have any skeletal evidence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the skeleton is affected, the severity of this manifestation depends on the degree of the deficiency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> typically is linked to specific ecological settings such as the high mountains where <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> is absent, or else it occurs with very low concentrations in water and soil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these areas, the prevalence may be as high as 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease can be expected to occur in archaeological human skeletal samples from endemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> is caused by a deficiency in the thyroid gland itself, and is not linked to any specific environmental context </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease may be the result of a genetic defect, but can also be caused by other pathological conditions that may affect the thyroid gland, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> of the two variants will be indistinguishable in archaeological human remains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In order to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in archaeological skeletal samples, one must be aware of the differences in pathological skeletal changes seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> in comparison with other diseases, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, that can cause similar abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve clinically documented cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> provide data for understanding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> associated with this disease </plain></SENT>
