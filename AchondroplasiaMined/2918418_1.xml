<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distraction rate of 0.5 mm/day was applied by means of a unilateral device </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lengthening was continued for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed at 3 (Group 1; n = 5), 19 (Group 2; n = 10), and 71 (Group 3; n = 3) weeks after the end of distraction to verify the magnitude of elongation at removal of the device (Group 1) and at the time of growth cessation (Groups 2 and 3), and to register possible permanent secondary joint changes (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average lengthening of 1.2 cm (12.3%) at removal of the device was reduced to 0.7 cm (6.4%) at cessation of growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middiaphyseal diameter of the elongated femur was enlarged after the lengthening procedure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average torsional strength of the elongated femur compared with the contralateral control was 83% in Group 1, 98% in Group 2, and 107% in Group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Degenerative changes were observed in the knee joints of three animals in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A two-way analysis of variance was applied for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data sets to test differences between control and elongated bones and between time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reduction in gained length by retardation of residual growth in the distal femur was significant (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The difference in external diameter between lengthened and control bones was significant in Groups 1 and 3 (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
