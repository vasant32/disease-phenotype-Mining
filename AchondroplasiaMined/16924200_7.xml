<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of surgical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> in patients associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>Thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> is one of the frequent skeletal manifestations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Few papers have been published on the surgical treatment of this condition, especially in skeletally mature patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who developed neurologic deficit due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> and underwent surgical treatment were evaluated (mean age, 32.5 years; mean follow-up, 3.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posterior osteotomy with segmental instrumentation was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures included pedicle subtraction osteotomy in 2 patients without a hypoplastic apical vertebra and spondylectomy with reconstruction of the anterior column in 2 patients with a hypoplastic apical vertebra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcomes (JOA scores), correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, and operative complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>, and 2 patients were unambulatory before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average preoperative JOA score was 5.8 points, which was improved to 9.3 points at the final follow-up (mean recovery rate, 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients obtained neurologic improvement and became ambulatory either with or without crutches after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative kyphotic angle was 96.3 degrees (range, 57 degrees -117 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The postoperative angles averaged 55.3 degrees (range, 30 degrees -110 degrees ), yielding a mean correction rate of 43.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neither loss of correction nor pseudarthrosis has been observed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Partial nerve root laceration and dural tear resulting in transient postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> were observed in 2 patients as complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Posterior spinal osteotomy with segmental instrumentation is a reasonable surgical option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Modification of the surgical procedures depending on the presence or absence of the dysplastic changes of the apical vertebra is necessary to obtain optimal results </plain></SENT>
