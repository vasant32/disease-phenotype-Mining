<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Mice are an increasingly important tool in ophthalmic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result of studying spontaneous and induced mutations, many new ocular diseases have been described in mice in recent years, including several degenerative <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> diseases that demonstrate progression with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clearly, documentation of progressive changes in clinical phenotype is an important facet of characterizing new mutations and for comparing them with human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite these facts, there are few published photographs of mouse fundi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The small size of the mouse eye and the steep curvature of its structures have made it difficult to obtain high quality fundus photographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to develop procedures for mouse fundus photography and angiography and to use these techniques to examine several new mouse strains with ocular abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have used a small animal fundus camera and condensing lens to develop a reliable technique for producing high quality fundus images of conscious <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> and pigmented mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fundus camera also was utilized to develop a method for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, which demonstrated the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular bed as well as abnormal vascular leakage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, several mouse strains with previously unreported ocular abnormalities (including two with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000588'>optic nerve colobomas</z:hpo>) and a catalogue of previously unpublished clinical images for various mutant mice are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether, we provide clinical images for C57BL/6J, BALB/cByJ, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> 1 (rd1), Rd2, rd3, rd7, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000938'>motor neuron degeneration</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000876'>Purkinje cell degeneration</z:mp>, kidney and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> defects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000588'>optic nerve coloboma</z:hpo> 1, and two apparently multigenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000588'>optic nerve colobomas</z:hpo> in a strain of mixed derivation (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="29811">ONC</z:chebi>) and the inbred CALB/Rk strain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our photography procedure reliably produces high quality images of the mouse fundus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This permitted us to record progressive <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> changes over time in the same animal, allowed us to compare the phenotypes of newly discovered <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> mutants to existing mutants at other institutions and to potentially similar human conditions, and finally, permitted us to produce a catalogue of previously unpublished clinical phenotypes for various mutant mice </plain></SENT>
