<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The long bone abnormality (lbab) mouse is a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> mutant characterized by overall smaller body size with proportionate dwarfing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> organs and shorter long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous linkage analysis has located the lbab mutation on chromosome 1 between the markers D1Mit9 and D1Mit488 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A genome-based positional approach was used to identify a mutation associated with lbab disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 122 genes and expressed sequence tags at the lbab region were screened for possible mutation by using genomic DNA from lbabl/lbab, lbab/+, and +/+ B6 mice and high throughput temperature gradient capillary electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sequence difference was identified in one of the amplicons of gene Nppc between lbab/lbab and +/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate the difference of Nppc in different types of mice at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation of Nppc was unique in lbab/lbab mice among multiple mouse inbred strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation of Nppc is co-segregated with lbab disease in 200 progenies produced from heterozygous lbab/+ parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A single nucleotide mutation of Nppc is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> in lbab/lbab mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Current genome information and technology allow us to efficiently identify single nucleotide mutations from roughly mapped disease loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lbab mouse is a useful model for hereditary human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
