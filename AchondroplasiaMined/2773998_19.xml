<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The achondroplastic foramen magnum is small at birth, and during the first year it has a severely impaired rate of growth especially in the transverse dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This markedly diminished growth results not only from abnormal endochondral bone growth but also because of abnormal placement and premature fusion of the synchondroses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the foramen magnum in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> should address absolute size of the transverse and sagittal dimensions, shape, and growth centers to determine growth potential of this area </plain></SENT>
