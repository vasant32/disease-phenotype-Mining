<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten achondroplastic patients underwent 3 bilateral humerus, 3 bilateral femur and 4 bilateral tibia lengthenings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To reduce the confounding effect of bone size, we used bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) to compare the three groups; this is a volumetric bone mineral density measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMAD in the distracted callus space was evaluated at 8 weeks after the start of distraction using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (mean +/- SD; g/cm3): in the humerus (0.24 +/- 0.08) it was significantly higher than in the tibia (0.10 +/- 0.02), while there was no difference between the humerus and femur (0.35 +/- 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the callus formation in the humerus during the distraction period of limb lengthening proceeded at a significantly faster rate than in the tibia, but there was no significant difference between the humerus and femur </plain></SENT>
