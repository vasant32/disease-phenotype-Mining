<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data pertaining to the cranial base were considered indicative of subnormal growth in some of the cranial synchondroses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The width of the neurocranium was slightly below the values of the controls, whereas neurocranial length and circumference appeared unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Facial height was larger than in the controls and facial index values were high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chin was receding, but the other values of facial depth were relatively large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were observed in tooth <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, dental age, or dental occlusion </plain></SENT>
