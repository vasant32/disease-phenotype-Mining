<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our hands, adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> have shown an unsatisfactory psychosocial adjustment due to the low adult height and hypothetically to the persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study has been carried out to evaluate the influence of growth in height on the social outcome in 45 adults with constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth delay</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interviews with subjects and parents were used for assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data obtained were compared with those found in an age, sex and social matched control group of adults with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some issues were also compared with the data we previously found in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Present mean age of the patients is 24 +/- 2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A high percentage (32.8%) of unemployment or underemployment (part-time work) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients (8.8%) were married, while 84.4% lived with their parents or relatives, confirming the notion of prolonged economic dependency on the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients preferred single sporting activities, avoiding team work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, scholastic achievement was in general similar to that observed in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Similar findings have been previously observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since no defect in GH secretion has been documented in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGD</z:e>, the presence of a negative psychosocial outcome more probably seems to be due to the final unsatisfactory height rather than to a GH defect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
