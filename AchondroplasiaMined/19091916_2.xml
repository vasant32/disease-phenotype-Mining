<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we directly addressed this question by evaluating whether changes in body proportions interfere with computation of traveled distance for targets located outside the reaching space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied locomotion and distance estimation in an achondroplastic child (ACH, 11 yr) before and after surgical elongation of the shank segments of both lower limbs and in healthy adults walking on stilts, designed to mimic shank-segment elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kinematic analysis of gait revealed that dynamic coupling of the thigh, shank, and foot segments changed substantially as a result of elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Step length remained unvaried, in spite of the significant increase in total limb length ( approximately 1.5-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These relatively shorter strides resulted from smaller oscillations of the shank segment, as would be predicted by proportional increments in limb size and not by asymmetrical segmental increment as in the present case (length of thighs was not modified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distance estimation was measured by walking with eyes closed toward a memorized target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, the behavior of ACH was comparable to that of typically developing participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, following shank elongation, the ACH walked significantly shorter distances when aiming at the same targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparable changes in limb kinematics, stride length, and estimation of traveled distance were found in adults wearing on stilts, suggesting that path integration errors in both cases were related to alterations in the intersegmental coordination of the walking limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with a dynamic locomotor body schema used for controlling step length and path estimation, based on inherent relationships between gait parameters and body proportions </plain></SENT>
