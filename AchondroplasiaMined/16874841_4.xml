<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of 6 pregnancies in one family where one parent has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 4 double heterozygote pregnancies and 2 where the fetus had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEDC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shortening of long bones was evident in both conditions from around 16 weeks gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other findings such as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0010880'>increased nuchal translucency</z:hpo> were more variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis of the FGFR3 and COL2AI gene once mutations are known in a family such as reported here can inform prenatal diagnosis and help to distinguish between the double heterozygote and a fetus which has inherited a single mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data presented here on the growth of the long bones and other sonographic features associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEDC</z:e> may aid prenatal diagnosis in cases where the mutation is not known </plain></SENT>
