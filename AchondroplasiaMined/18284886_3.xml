<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiplex fluorescent assay including the common G380R mutation in the FGFR3 gene and eight close polymorphic markers was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First and second polar bodies (PB) were used for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An affected woman was treated with routine long-protocol ovarian stimulation and puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> cycle, out of four fertilized oocytes, PB analysis revealed two mutant oocytes, one with total amplification failure of the maternal allele and one with inconclusive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi> cycle, 14 oocytes were retrieved following a higher FSH dose and by performing oocyte retrieval and by placing the patient in the anti-Trendelenburg position using abdominal pressure to allow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> follicles to be drained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following PB analysis, two embryos containing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FGFR3 allele were transferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This led to an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery by Caesarean section at week 38 of a healthy boy, carrying the FGFR3 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> maternal allele </plain></SENT>
