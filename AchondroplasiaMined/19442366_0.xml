<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of the fibular free flap in the achondroplastic patient and to report the potential pitfalls of free flap surgery on this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our experience with two fibular free flaps in this rare situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This is the largest series of fibular free flaps reported on the achondroplastic patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adrenal event resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and ultimately led to the failure of our first reconstructive attempt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Corrective measures were taken during the secondary reconstruction to prevent these systemic issues from coming into play, which ultimately led to a successful free fibular transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Free fibular transfer is possible for facial reconstruction in the achondroplastic patient, and success can be improved if measures are taken to prevent systemic complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in the case of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> adrenal event </plain></SENT>
