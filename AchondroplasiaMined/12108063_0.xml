<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is caused usually by de novo mutation in the gene of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>Inheritance</z:hpo> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common mutation C742T leads to substitution of arginine by cysteine in 248 position of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (R248C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GOAL: Presentation of clinical picture, radiological findings and molecular diagnostics in three patients with TD hospitalized in PAIP in 1994-2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Three patients with TD were hospitalized in PAIP between 1994 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were admitted in the 1st, 2nd, 19th day of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were referred with diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One newborn was born after uncomplicated pregnancy with cesarean section due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>large head circumference</z:hpo> found on prenatal USG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two other newborns were born preterm (34 week of gestation), vaginally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One pregnancy was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required oxygen therapy, two were artificially ventilated (21 and 16 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three newborns died due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, average length of life--29 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The diagnosis was established based on clinical presentation (abnormal proportions, shortening and deformation of the extremities, maldevelopment of the chest, large cranium) and radiological presentation (typical vertebral bodies, long bones shaped as telephone receiver) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In two cases molecular analysis was performed, which excluded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, in one of those patients molecular studies directly confirmed presence of the most common mutation leading to TD (R248C) </plain></SENT>
