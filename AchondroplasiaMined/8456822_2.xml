<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These included narrowing of the skull base and "towering" petrous ridges resulting in abnormal orientation of the inner and middle ear structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000403'>frequent otitis media</z:hpo> and four had experienced tympanic membrane tube insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had significant <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> and one patient had combined hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the temporal bone morphologic changes were found to be correlated with the degree of either sensorineural or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fusion of the ossicular chain was not present in any of our cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Appropriate treatment of frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> and early awareness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle ear effusions</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> may be of great importance in preventing permanent hearing loss </plain></SENT>
