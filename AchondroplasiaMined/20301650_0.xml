<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Hypochondroplasia is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>; stocky build; disproportionately <z:hpo ids='HP_0009824'>short arms</z:hpo> and legs; broad, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004279'>short hands</z:hpo> and feet; mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001388'>joint laxity</z:hpo>; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiologic features include shortening of long bones with mild metaphyseal flare; narrowing of the inferior lumbar itnerpedicular distances; short, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006429'>broad femoral neck</z:hpo>; and squared, shortened ilia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The skeletal features are very similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> but usually tend to be milder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical complications common to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002982'>tibial bowing</z:hpo>, obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>) occur less frequently in hypochondroplasia but deficits in mental capacity and/or function may be more prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children usually present as toddlers or school-age children with failure to grow; with age, limb disproportion and other features become more prominent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Hypochondroplasia is diagnosed by the recognition of characteristic clinical and radiologic findings that remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is difficult to make in children under the age of three years, as skeletal disproportion tends to be mild and many of the radiographic features are subtle during infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA-based testing is available and about 70% of affected individuals are heterozygous for a mutation in FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, it is clear that locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> exists because mutations in other as-yet unidentified genes can result in similar, if not identical, phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in hypochondroplasia is influenced by parental expectations and concerns; one approach is to address these concerns rather than trying to treat the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laminectomy relieves symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo>; about 70% of individuals experience relief of symptoms following decompression without laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Developmental milestones are followed closely during early childhood so that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental deficiencies</z:hpo> are addressed with special educational programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: Hypochondroplasia is inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that the majority of new cases result from spontaneous mutations and that the unaffected parents of a child with hypochondroplasia have an extremely low risk (&lt;0.01%) of having another affected child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An individual with hypochondroplasia who has a partner of average stature has a 50% risk of having a child with hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>If an affected individual's partner also has hypochondroplasia (or another dominant form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>), genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> and the lack of medical literature addressing these circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prenatal molecular genetic testing is available if the mutation(s) in the parent(s) with hypochondroplasia have been identified; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as heterozygous hypochondroplasia are not common </plain></SENT>
