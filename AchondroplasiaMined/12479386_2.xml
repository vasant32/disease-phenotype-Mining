<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A subgroup of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (MED) have been found to harbor mutations within the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two diseases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorders that are characterized by an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The COMP gene is expressed primarily in chondrocytes in articular cartilage as well as in tendon and ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, control over tissue specific COMP expression may be an important aspect in cartilage biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To begin an analysis of the regulation of COMP expression, we have cloned, sequenced and characterized the entire genomic clone for mouse COMP that includes the COMP promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The COMP coding region spans 19 exons over approximately 8.4 kb of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arrangement and size of the exons have a remarkable similarity to those of the human COMP genomic sequence, indicating a significant degree of genomic conservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a 453 basepair region of the putative COMP promoter reveals two strong transcriptional repressor elements located between position -356 and -304 and between -251 and -180, relative to the start site for transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These repressor elements down-regulate transcription from the promoter in a broad spectrum of cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Removal of the repressor DNA sequence from the COMP promoter leads to significant enhancement in transcriptional activity, indicating that this region acts in a dominant manner to transcriptional activators located more proximal to the start site of transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This region also represses transcription when linked to a heterologous promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This repressor region probably down-regulates transcription from the COMP promoter in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may help to repress transcription of COMP in non-cartilaginous tissues and/or may aid in the expression of COMP to the appropriate level in tissues such as cartilage, tendon and ligament </plain></SENT>
