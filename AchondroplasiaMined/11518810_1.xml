<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factors play an important role in the control of ovarian folliculogenesis, but the complete repertoire of ovarian receptors which can transduce the fibroblast growth factor signals and their precise localization in the ovary have not yet been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common form of inherited human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> results from a point mutation in the transmembrane region of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mouse model for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was generated by introducing the human mutation (glycine 380-arginine) into the mouse fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (G374R) by a "knock-in" approach using gene targeting leading to a constitutively active receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in the development of dwarf mice that share many features with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we report that female (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 G374R) dwarf mice become <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While no significant changes were observed in the anatomical and histological appearance of ovaries of 3-wk-old dwarf mice, a dramatic difference was observed in ovaries of 3-month-old mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovary consists mainly of healthy corpora lutea and follicles at different stages of development, whereas the ovaries of the dwarf mice remain small and contain mainly follicles with a progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the granulosa cells, and no corpora lutea could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of LH, FSH, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> were lower by 72.3%, 38.0%, and 40.0%, respectively, in the blood of the dwarf mice compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice, and the total bioactivity of pituitary FSH and LH was lower by 65.6% and 79.6%, respectively, in the dwarf mice compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However treatment with PMSG and human CG of the dwarf mice led to rapid follicular development and formation of corpora lutea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor gene p53 was increased dramatically in ovaries of the dwarf mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 cellular receptors in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and dwarf animals was demonstrated by Western blot and immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of the fibroblast growth factor receptors in the two strains shows significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovaries fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 was homogeneously distributed on the cell membrane of the granulosa cells and was absent in theca as well as corpora lutea cells, whereas in dwarf mice ovaries it was highly clustered on granulosa cells and very often appears in endocytic vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Aged oocytes were more frequently observed in preantral follicles of ovaries of the dwarf mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, oocytes isolated from antral follicles resume their meiotic division at a high percentage, similar to oocytes obtained from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results imply fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 involvement in the control of follicular development through regulation of granulosa cell growth and differentiation, and that unovulation in the dwarf mice could be overcome in part by administration of exogenous gonadotropins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is suggested that the <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>infertile</z:mp> phenotype is partially due to defects in the pituitary-gonadal axis </plain></SENT>
