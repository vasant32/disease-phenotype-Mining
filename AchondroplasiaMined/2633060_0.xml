<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On one side, the observation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> suggest that the venous hyperpressure could be the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo>; on the other side, reports have demonstrated that an increased superior sagittal venous pressure could be the consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors undertook a study to determine if there was a test that could distinguish between rare instances of increased superior sagittal venous pressure caused by structural and irreversible narrowing of the sinus, and those caused by increased intraranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This test is based on the study of venous pressure variation during cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal as compared to simultaneous intracranial pressure variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between a sinus venous hyperpressure and an enlargement of the ventricles, the pathology of pericerebral collection occurring in such cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
