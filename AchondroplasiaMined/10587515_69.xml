<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a glycine-to-cysteine substitution at position 375 (Gly375Cys) in human FGFR3 causes ligand-independent dimerization and phosphorylation of FGFR3 and that the equivalent substitution at position 369 (Gly369Cys) in mouse FGFR3 causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> with features mimicking human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, homozygous mice were more severely affected than heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting mutant mice exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009815'>shortened limbs</z:hpo> due to retarded endochondral bone growth and premature closure of cranial base synchondroses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates, mutant mice growth plates shared an expanded resting zone and narrowed proliferating and hypertrophic zones, which is correlated with the activation of Stat proteins and upregulation of cell-cycle inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000063'>Reduced bone density</z:mp> is accompanied by increased activity of osteoclasts and upregulation of genes that are related to osteoblast differentiation, including osteopontin, osteonectin, and osteocalcin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data reveal an essential role for FGF/FGFR3 signals in both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
