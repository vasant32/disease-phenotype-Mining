<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive single-center series of 36 achondroplastic dwarfs with symptomatic lumbar stenosis underwent dynamic lumbar myelography to determine the most stenotic lumbar segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This level was surgically decompressed by selective widening of the lumbar interapophyseolaminar diameter; laminectomy was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The L2-3 level was decompressed in 97% of the cases and the L1-2 and L3-4 levels in 58 and 61%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower lumbar levels were rarely affected by stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenosis typically did not occur at the level of the lamina, where the pseudoscalloping of the vertebral body compensates for the spinal narrowing, obviating the need for laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complete relief of symptoms was demonstrated in 25 (71.4%) of 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tolerable disease remained in eight patients (22.9%) postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two cases (5.7%) surgery resulted in no benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One case was lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The presence of a lumbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> complicated one procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series the interapophyseolaminar decompression was demonstrated to be an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of symptomatic stenosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The upper lumbar segments, particularly the L2-3 level, were most frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dynamic lumbar myelography proved mandatory in demonstrating the symptomatic level </plain></SENT>
