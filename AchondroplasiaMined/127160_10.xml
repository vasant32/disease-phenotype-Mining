<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> were extracted with 4 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32735">guanidinium chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> extracted from fetal growth cartilage gave a single band with a slightly slower migration </plain></SENT>
