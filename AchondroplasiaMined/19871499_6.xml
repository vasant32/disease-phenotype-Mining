<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pathological observations on hereditary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in the rabbit have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, the chief features of interest are: <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>reduced size</z:mp> with disproportionately shortened extremities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>large head</z:hpo>, cutaneous and subcutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of variable degree and distribution, small shortened bones with a cartilaginous appearance and texture, immature teeth, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> in one-fourth the cases; blood-stained fluid in the thoracic and abdominal cavities; a comparatively <z:mp ids='MP_0002188'>small heart</z:mp> pointing to the right of the midline, a very large firm thymus, a large pale soft spleen, a large swollen liver with red mottling, and a stomach distended with thin greenish mucus but no milk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean relative weights of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> organs in terms of the net body weight were larger than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> new-born litter mates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean actual weights of the kidneys, the brain, and especially the spleen and the thymus were also larger than their respective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, those of the heart, liver, and adrenals were slightly smaller, while that of the pituitary was the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> endochondral cartilages show marked abnormalities of differentiation with pronounced deficiency of ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcification of membranous bones is likewise deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histological abnormalities of the long bones are very similar to, if not identical with, those characteristic of human fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodystrophy</z:mp>, the creeper fowl condition, the "bull-dog" calf, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No histological evidence was found in any organ which would suggest a basis for a responsible causal agent of the abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minor to marked vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is a variable feature but is fairly widely distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes in the thyroid indicate an active gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cellular pattern of the pituitary is characterized by some increase in basophilic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lymphoid elements of the spleen are more or less depleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hemopoietic tissue in the spleen and liver is reduced in amount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In blood obtained from the heart, there is a reduction in the numbers of red and white cells and platelets and in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> content as well; immature cells and particularly normoblasts are comparatively numerous </plain></SENT>
