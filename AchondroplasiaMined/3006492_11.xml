<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We suggest that mutations for fragile X-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Martin-Bell syndrome</z:e>, and perhaps also for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, may result from the insertion of transposable elements (TE's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of genetic function could result from either the insertion of TE's within or adjacent to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomal gene or, in the case of fragile X, from the loss of genes distal to the site of TE insertion following subsequent TE excision without ligation of the resulting discontinuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The phenotypically and often cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transmitting males in fragile X pedigrees are interpreted not as "nonpenetrant" transmitters of a fully formed fragile X but rather as transmitters of some or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the factors necessary for TE insertion at Xq27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We consider it likely that such insertion frequently first occurs, both in soma and especially in the germline, in their daughters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our models predict that father to son transmission of causative factors would be a common occurrence in fragile X pedigrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of documented father to son transmission either points to a flaw in the models or reflects systematic bias in the collection of pedigree information </plain></SENT>
