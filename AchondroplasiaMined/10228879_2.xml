<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of lower limb lengthening on nerve conduction was investigated in 5 achondroplastic subjects who underwent callotasis on a "cross-over" basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and F waves from the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) were studied preoperatively and then after removal of the axial fixators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SEPs at the end of lengthening showed that both the latency of the plexus potential (P9) and, albeit to a lesser extent, the interpeak time between the plexus and the spinal cord (N15) potentials were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The central conduction time (N15-P33) and the amplitude of the scalp responses were not modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latencies of the F waves were much longer at the end of bone distraction than in basal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increases in both PTN SEPs and F-wave latencies are consistent with a slowing of conduction The extent of these latency shifts correlated closely with the degree of limb lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We calculated that, on average, each cm of lengthening could produce 0.21 msec and 0.22 msec delays respectively, suggesting a similar effect of the stretching on both sensory and motor fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicated that the damage could be widely distributed along the whole length of the nerve, affecting both the peripheral (trunk) and proximal (plexus and root) segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electrophysiological changes were not associated with any persistent clinical complaint </plain></SENT>
