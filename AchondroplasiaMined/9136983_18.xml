<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, mutations in FGF receptors have been shown to be associated with a number of genetically dominant human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A remarkably conserved mutation (Gly 380--&gt;Arg) in the transmembrane region of FGFR-3 has been shown to be responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) but it was not clear whether such mutations result in loss of receptor function or constitutive activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have therefore made mutations in the transmembrane regions of murine FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 and studied their effect on receptor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that the ACH mutation in FGFR-3 as well as two similar mutations in FGFR-2 result in constitutive activation of these receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is manifested in their ability to become autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand in L6 cells, transforming activity on NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and the ability to inhibit myogenic differentiation in the absence of growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the transmembrane region of FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 plays a regulatory role in receptor function and the ACH mutation produces a dominant oversignaling receptor which is no longer regulated by FGF binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings also support the newly identified role of FGF signaling as a negative regulator of bone growth </plain></SENT>
