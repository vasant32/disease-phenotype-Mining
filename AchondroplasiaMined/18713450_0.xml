<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>Contracture</z:hpo> is a condition of abnormal shortening or shrinkage of a muscle, and or a tendon often with persistent flexion or distortion at a joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Careful documentation of the kind of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> encountered in different paediatric disorders is important in distinguishing a specific subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> has been considered as the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo> syndrome, but there are a variety of other syndromes within this category, and other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005753'>limb shortening</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 5-year-old boy of Austrian origin who manifests progressive joint limitations in connection with a dysplastic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo> namely <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> punctata-tibial-metacarpal-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progressive joint limitations of maximal intensity over the hip, and the ankle joints were the main presenting features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Osteochondrodysplasias</z:e> involve abnormal bone or cartilage growth leading to skeletal maldevelopment, often <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is by physical examination, radiographic documentation, and, in some cases, genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> punctata, early life radiographic examination is fundamental, since resolution of the punctate calcifications leaving abnormal epiphyses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000945'>flared and irregular metaphyses</z:hpo> after age one to three years seems to be characteristic </plain></SENT>
