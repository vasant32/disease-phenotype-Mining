<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anesthesia in these patients presents several particularities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present report was to describe an achondroplasic patient case, with a previous history of surgical procedure of the vertebral column for medullar decompression, submitted to haemorrhoidectomy through the bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Male patient, 47 years old, achondroplasic, hospitalized to perform hemorrhoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon physical examination, he presented a shortened neck with limited extension of the head, Mallampati class IV, thyromental distance of 6 cm and opening of the mouth of 3.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vertebral column presented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002942'>thoracic kyphosis</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo>, in addition to a surgical scar in the lumbar region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves was performed with ropivacaine at 1%, via transperineal, with isolated needle measuring 0.8 mm x 100 mm 21G (Stimuplex A100 BBraun, Melsungen, Germany) connected to the peripheral nerve stimulator (Stimuplex-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DIG</z:e>, BBraun).The patient was positioned in ventral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decubitus</z:e> and the surgery started after 15 minutes of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the entire procedure, the patient remained conscious and did not report pain or discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Up to the moment his hospital discharge (22 hours after the performance of the blockade), the patient did not mention pain, discomfort, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, vomit, motor blockade, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After his discharge from the hospital, he evolved well presenting evacuation after 31 hours from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The case illustrated the use of the bilateral blockade of the pudend nerves, with the help of the neurostimulator, as an isolated <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> techniques for hemorrhoidectomy </plain></SENT>
