<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Modern investigators incline to the opinion, that more biochemical than biomechanical disorders take part in cause of the "idiopathic'' scolioses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seems, however, that there is not only one cause but more in some subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Idiopathic scolioses, which have symptomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, seem to be a big one of these subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases allow to state a hypothesis, in which kind a disordered metabolism leads to a deviation of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is basing on the fact, that the enchondral growth in the length and the periostal growth in the width of "long bones'' are not regulated in the same endocrinological kind and that the enchondral growth of the vertebral-bodies-column happens in cranio-caudal direction, the enchondral growth of the vertebral-archies-column, however, in anterior-posterior direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the balance between enchondral and periostal growth is disturbed, you can see typical chances on the long bones, which resemble either an "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>" or a "chondrodysplasy" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same disturbance will cause a "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>" respectively a "<z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>lordosis</z:hpo>" (or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>) on the vertebral spine; either the bodies-column or the archies-column will become longer (higher) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of metabolism research are suitable to these facts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the balance between enchondral and periostal growth,--basing on a dysbolism,--is disturbed in such a kind, that the vertebral-bodies-column is growing faster than the vertebral-archies-column, the vertebral spine is forced to change into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>lordosis</z:hpo> respectively into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If you want to cure an idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, you first have to remove or to paralyse the dysbolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The aim of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> research has to be to find an effective chemotherapeutical treatment of mindst a part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> idiopathic scolioses </plain></SENT>
