<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (4 months to 6 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> and/or other neurologic manifestations underwent plain computed tomography (CT) of the craniocervical junction; six also underwent CT myelography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For objectification, multiplanar reconstruction was used to complement axial plane measurements by providing coronal and sagittal measurements; multiplanar reconstruction also improved perception of the longitudinal relationships between the brain stem and subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A narrow subarachnoid space was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients; marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> was present in nine, six of whom underwent CT myelography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These six had marked focal obliteration of the subarachnoid space on both plain CT and CT myelography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the subarachnoid space immediately above and below the craniocervical junction is normally capacious, when marked constriction was present, no additional information could have been gained from CT myelography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, plain CT was shown to be sufficient for surgical planning (suboccipital decompression) in nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
