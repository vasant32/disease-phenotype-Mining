<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors of this paper describe two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in whom triventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> has been successfully treated using endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors performed ETVs in two children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> involving a moderate macrocranium and enlarged lateral and third ventricles with intermittent clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic procedure revealed a significant deformation of the floor of the third ventricle in both patients caused by longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the anatomical variations such as empty sella and the persistence of the infundibular recess, the ETV procedure became technically demanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The standard ventriculostomy on the tuber cinereum was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ventriculostomies were performed on the part of the third ventricular floor that was hanging ventral to the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients became symptom free postoperatively, and phase-contrast cine magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging studies confirmed the patency and effectivity of the ventriculostomy sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that ETVs may constitute an alternative for ventriculoperitoneal shunt therapy as the treatment of choice for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who have triventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Attention should be paid to the shape of the floor of the third ventricle, however, especially in cases of longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An association of the empty sella or the persistence of the infundibular recess must be carefully evaluated using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies before attempting ETVs in such patients </plain></SENT>
