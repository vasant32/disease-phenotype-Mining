<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported the growth-promoting effect of growth hormone (GH) in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this expanded clinical study, dose dependency and the long-term effect of GH were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prepubertal children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (82 males and 63 females) were randomly divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with 0.5 IU/kg per week or 1.0 IU/kg per week subcutaneous recombinant human GH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 75 patients, the mutational analysis of fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 revealed that G1138A was detected in 70 and G1138C was found in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GH <z:mp ids='MP_0002865'>increased growth rate</z:mp> and height z score in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GH also increased serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-binding protein-3 and osteocalcin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were observed in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GH therapy is a useful method for improvement of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
