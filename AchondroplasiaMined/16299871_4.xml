<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: In a 5-y growth hormone (GH) treatment study including 1 y without treatment, we investigated growth and body proportion response in 35 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were randomized to either 0.1 IU/kg (n = 18) or 0.2 IU/kg (n = 17) per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GH treatment was interrupted for 12 mo after 2 y of treatment in prepubertal patients to study catch-down growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> (HSDS) at start was -5.6 and -5.2 for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively, and mean age 7.3 and 6.6 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean growth velocity (baseline 4.5/4.6 cm/y for the groups) increased significantly by 1.9/3.6 cm/y during the first year and by 0.5/1.5 cm/y during the second year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the third year, a decrease of growth velocity was observed at 1.9/1.3 cm/y below baseline values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HSDS increased significantly by 0.6/0.8 during the first year of treatment and in total by 1.3/1.6 during the 5 y of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sitting height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> improved significantly from -2.1/-1.7 to -0.8/0.2 during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body proportion (sitting height/total height) or arm span did not show any significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: GH treatment of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> improves height during 4 y of therapy without adverse effect on trunk-leg disproportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The short-term effect is comparable to that reported in Turner and Noonan syndrome and in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
