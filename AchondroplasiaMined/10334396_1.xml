<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this pilot study we investigated the hypothesis that intrinsic and extrinsic brainstem lesions situated within the pontomedullary region would effect the integrity of respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study sample consisted of three patients with anatomic brainstem abnormalities associated with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformation</z:hpo>, Chiari II malformation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syringobulbia</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> with cervicomedullary compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were compared to an age- and sex-matched control group of nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each subject's electrocardiogram was recorded in a quiet room and digitized by a personal computer during five 1-minute periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>R-R intervals within each 1-minute period were converted to heart rate in 120 successive 0.5-second intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The resultant heartrate time series was converted to its underlying frequency composition by a fast Fourier transform and averaged across minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> was defined as the variability in the time series over a frequency range (0.096 to 0.48 Hz) corresponding to a range of respiratory rates from 6 to 30 breaths per minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis revealed a significant reduction in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (P &lt; .05), defined as the summated area under the curve, with a mean for controls of 35.42+/-28.13 SD and for subjects of 17.20+/-11.50 SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a gradient of abnormality noted, with the mildest deviation in respiratory sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> for the patient with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0007099'>Chiari I malformation</z:hpo> and maximum deviation seen in the patient with extrinsic cervicomedullary compression </plain></SENT>
