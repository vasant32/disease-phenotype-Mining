<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, safety and results of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) in ectopically located kidneys and in patients with musculoskeletal deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen such patients underwent PNL between June 2005 and May 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean stone size was 27.4 mm (16-37 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo>, 2 patients each had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, cross-fused <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> and pelvic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000086'>ectopic kidney</z:hpo>, and 1 patient had thoracic kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a preoperative CT scan of the abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative ultrasound- or CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomy (<z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi>) was done in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent laparoscopic-assisted PNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent standard PNL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stone-free rate, complication rate and need for secondary intervention were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PNL was successfully completed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A second ultrasound-guided intraoperative puncture was required in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Re-look PNL was required in 1 patient and the same patient later required shock wave lithotripsy for complete stone clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 patients (92.3%) were rendered stone-free in a single sitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PNL is a feasible and effective modality in anomalous kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Preoperative planning with CT and image-guided <z:chebi fb="12" ids="35591">PCN</z:chebi> is helpful in these situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Laparoscopic-assisted PNL can be safely performed in patients where access to a renal collecting system by fluoroscopy or image-guided assistance (ultrasound or CT scan) is not possible </plain></SENT>
