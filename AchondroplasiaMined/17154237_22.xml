<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, prenatal diagnosis of this disorder relies on invasive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that fetal single gene point mutations could be detected in cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) from maternal plasma by either the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) assay with single allele base extension reaction (SABER) approach or the size fractionation of cf-DNA in maternal plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we combined the two approaches to non-invasively examine the fetal G1138A mutation in maternal plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>cf-DNA was extracted from maternal plasma samples obtained from two pregnant women at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fetal G1138A mutation was determined by the analysis of size-fractionated cf-DNA in maternal plasma using MALDI-TOF MS with SABER approach and homogenous MassEXTEND (hME) assay, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fetal G1138A mutation was detectable in the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-affected pregnancies by the analysis of cf-DNA in maternal plasma using MALDI-TOF MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the size-fractionation approach led to a more precise detection of the fetal mutation in both analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This analysis would be suitable for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of diseases caused by fetal single gene point mutations </plain></SENT>
