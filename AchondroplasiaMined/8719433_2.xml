<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed the reliability and repeatability of a new computerized bone age system, both versions 3.4 and 3.5 (licensed by Discerning System Inc. and Ares Service SA, Serono), able to automatically assess bone age on a left hand and wrist radiograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This computer system is based upon Tanner and Whitehouse's method (TW2), but there are important differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our sample included an initial group of 40 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth delay</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">constitutional delay of growth and puberty</z:e> (n = 10), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271561" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GHD">growth hormone insufficiency</z:e>/deficiency (n = 15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo>/Silver-Russell syndrome (n = 9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000826'>precocious puberty</z:hpo> (n = 6), as well as 20 patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> n = 7, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> n = 7, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220659" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acrodysostosis</z:e> n = 5, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> n = 1), 7 girls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e>, and 10 boys with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple anthropometric readings of the same radiographs demonstrated excellent repeatability of the assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of times that a manual insertion of a grade was required was similar in four different assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The computerized method did not entirely avoid errors in interpretation as the position of the x-ray on the screen was critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a high manual insertion rate in radiographs of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the computer assessment system, version 3.5, performed adequately for radiographs of children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> and had the advantage of a continuous scale of assessment </plain></SENT>
