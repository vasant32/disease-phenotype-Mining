<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CNP) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by inhibiting the pathway of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the pharmacological activity of a 39 amino acid CNP analog (BMN 111) with an extended plasma half-life due to its resistance to neutral-endopeptidase (NEP) digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In ACH human growth-plate chondrocytes, we demonstrated a decrease in the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, confirming that this CNP analog inhibits fibroblast-growth-factor-mediated MAPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, we analyzed the phenotype of Fgfr3(Y367C/+) mice and showed the presence of ACH-related clinical features in this mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that in Fgfr3(Y367C/+) mice, treatment with this CNP analog led to a significant recovery of bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed an increase in the axial and appendicular skeleton lengths, and improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>-related clinical features included flattening of the skull, reduced crossbite, straightening of the tibias and femurs, and correction of the growth-plate defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results provide the proof of concept that BMN 111, a NEP-resistant CNP analog, might benefit individuals with ACH and hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
