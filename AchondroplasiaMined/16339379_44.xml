<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many domestic dog breeds have originated through fixation of discrete mutations by intense artificial selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result of this process, markers in the proximity of genes influencing breed-defining traits will have reduced variation (a selective sweep) and will show divergence in allele frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, low-resolution genomic scans can potentially be used to identify regions containing genes that have a major influence on breed-defining traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We model the process of breed formation and show that the probability of two or three adjacent marker loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one breed (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable and moderately spaced markers are utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also use simulations with selection to demonstrate that even a moderately spaced set of highly polymorphic markers (e.g., one every 0.8 cM) has high power to detect regions targeted by strong artificial selection in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we show that a gene responsible for black coat color in the Large Munsterlander has a 40-Mb region surrounding the gene that is very low in heterozygosity for microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, we survey 302 microsatellite markers in the Dachshund and find three linked monomorphic microsatellite markers <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> within a 10-Mb region on chromosome 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This region contains the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in humans, but not in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, our results suggest that the causative mutation is a gene or regulatory region closely linked to FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
