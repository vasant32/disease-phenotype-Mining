<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is the most common form among the different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029422" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteochondrodysplasia</z:e> that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dwarves develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> quite frequently and surgical treatment has shown greater efficacy, both for effective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and long term maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this report was to present the case of bariatric surgery with Y-en-Roux gastric bypass in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplastic dwarf</z:e> with morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The different difficulties in the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of this patient and the way they were dealt with were discussed in order to decrease intraoperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: This is a 29 years old female dwarf with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> since childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was 123 cm tall and weighed 144 kg at the time of admission to the Bariatric Surgery service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a body mass index (BMI) of 95.18 kg.m2, she had several associated diseases especially of the respiratory system and osteoarticular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a long follow-up with diet, exercises, and psychological support, her clinical condition improved and she was referred for surgery: Y-en-Roux gastroplasty using the technique of Capella-Fobi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intubation of the awake patient under direct laryngoscopy was difficult and a bronchofibroscope had to be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery was uneventful and the patient was maintained under total intravenous anesthesia with continuous infusion of remifentanil and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She was extubated at the end of the surgery still in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous comorbidities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> can hinder the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management, especially regarding the airways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A thorough pre-<z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> evaluation is necessary to anticipate the conducts and minimize risks, therefore optimizing the evolution of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
