<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enlarged lamellar rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles were shown to contain accumulated COMP along with type IX collagen, a cartilage-specific component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>COMP was secreted and assembled normally into the extracellular matrix of tendon, demonstrating that the accumulation of COMP in chondrocytes was a cell-specific phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We believe that the intracellular storage of COMP causes a nonspecific aggregation of cartilage-specific molecules and results in a cartilage matrix deficient in required structural components leading to impaired cartilage growth and maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data support a common pathogenetic mechanism behind two clinically related <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002654'>multiple epiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
