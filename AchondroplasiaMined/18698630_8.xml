<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared data from seven population-based birth defects monitoring programs in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also present data on the association between older paternal age and these birth defects, which has been described in earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> ranged from 0.36 to 0.60 per 10,000 livebirths (1/27,780-1/16,670 livebirths) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 per 10,000 livebirths (1/33,330-1/47,620 livebirths) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Texas, fathers that were 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and &gt; or =40 years of age had significantly increased rates of de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> among their offspring compared with younger fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted prevalence odds ratios were 2.8 (95% CI; 1.2, 6.7), 2.8 (95% CI; 1.0, 7.6), 4.9 (95% CI; 1.7, 14.3), and 5.0 (95% CI; 1.5, 16.1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the same age categories, the crude prevalence odds ratios for de novo cases of thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> in Texas were 5.8 (95% CI; 1.7, 9.8), 3.9 (95% CI; 1.1, 6.7), 6.1 (95% CI; 1.6, 10.6), and 10.2 (95% CI; 2.6, 17.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is one-third to one-half as frequent as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in the prevalence of these conditions across monitoring programs were consistent with random fluctuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Birth defects monitoring programs may be a good source of ascertainment for population-based studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, provided that diagnoses are confirmed by review of medical records </plain></SENT>
