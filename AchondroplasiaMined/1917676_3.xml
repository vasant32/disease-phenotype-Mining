<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> littermates were generally similar in shape, but mutants were significantly different from these controls and from each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of morphological differences between the mutants and between the mutants and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls is examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These differences are discussed in relation to the different effects of the four genes on bone morphogenesis, and the significance of these findings in relation to the contributions of cartilage formation and bone resorption to skeletal morphogenesis is considered </plain></SENT>
