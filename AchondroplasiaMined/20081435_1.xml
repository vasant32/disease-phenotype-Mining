<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> (inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>), is characterized by a significant delay in the development of communication and motor skills, particularly during the first 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some information regarding timing of development for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is available, no study has evaluated simultaneously the pattern of skill development across multiple key developmental areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This study used a retrospective questionnaire to quantify developmental data on milestone achievement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty families of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> throughout Australia and New Zealand were asked to document age of acquisition for 41 gross motor, fine motor, and communication and feeding milestones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than one half of the items assessed were milestones identified in the Australian State Government Personal Health Record Books </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results are compared with previously available information regarding development of motor skills by a cohort of American children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the results support previously reported delays in gross motor and communication skill development, fine motor development does not seem to be as delayed as previously suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Information on development of self-feeding skills is presented for the first time and occurs later in this group than the typically developing population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We describe 2 distinctive and previously unreported methods of transitioning between static positions commonly used by children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delays were reported across gross motor and communication and feeding skills but were not observed during development of fine motor skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional information is also offered regarding a variety of unusual movement strategies demonstrated by young children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
