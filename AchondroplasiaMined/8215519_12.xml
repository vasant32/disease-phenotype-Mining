<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded in 19 of the subjects to screen for the presence of brainstem abnormalities, which are one of the potential aetiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen children aged 1 to 14 years, and five young adults, aged 20 to 31 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002781'>upper airway obstruction</z:hpo> and 15 (75%) had a pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo> index (greater than five per hour) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other sleep associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002086'>respiratory abnormalities</z:hpo>, including partial obstruction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnoea</z:hpo>, and abnormal electromyographic activity of accessory muscles of respiration, also showed a high prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SEPs were abnormal in eight (42%), but there was no correlation between abnormal SEPs and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnoea</z:hpo> during sleep, either qualitatively or quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence of both sleep related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002086'>respiratory abnormalities</z:hpo> and abnormal SEPs in young subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the sleep related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002086'>respiratory abnormalities</z:hpo> do not always result in significant blood gas disturbances or correlate with abnormal SEPs in this group </plain></SENT>
