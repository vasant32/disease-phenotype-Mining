<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several of these same FGFR3 mutations have also been identified somatically in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002862'>bladder carcinoma</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302592" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on reports that strongly activated mutants of FGFR3 such as the TDII (K650E) mutant signal preferentially from within the secretory pathway, the inhibitory properties of nordihydroguaiartic acid (NDGA), which blocks protein transport through the Golgi, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NDGA was able to inhibit FGFR3 autophosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, signaling molecules downstream of FGFR3 activation such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1, STAT3, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were inhibited by NDGA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using HEK293 cells expressing activated FGFR3-TDII, together with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> cell lines expressing activated forms of FGFR3, NDGA generally resulted in a decrease in MAPK activation by 1 hour, and resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> over 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of NDGA on activated FGFR3 derivatives targeted either to the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm were also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibitory small molecules such as NDGA that target a specific subcellular compartment may be beneficial in the inhibition of activated receptors such as FGFR3 that signal from the same compartment </plain></SENT>
