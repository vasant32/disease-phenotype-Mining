<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the pediatric achondroplastic patient, such stenosis may lead to cervicomedullary compression with serious sequelae, including <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001276'>hypertonia</z:hpo>, delayed motor mile-stones, and respiratory compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a standardized protocol the authors have treated 15 young achondroplastic patients with documented cervicomedullary compression by craniocervical decompression and duroplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following this procedure, significant improvement in presenting neurological or respiratory complaints was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate in this series was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major cause of morbidity associated with this procedure was perioperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the surgical wound, presumably related to coexisting abnormalities of CSF dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This problem was successfully managed by temporary or, when necessary, permanent CSF diversion procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that craniocervical decompression is an effective and safe treatment for young achondroplastic patients with cervicomedullary compression </plain></SENT>
