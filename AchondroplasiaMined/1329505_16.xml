<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type X collagen is a homotrimeric, short chain, nonfibrillar collagen that is expressed exclusively by hypertrophic chondrocytes at the sites of endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution and pattern of expression of the type X collagen gene (COL10A1) suggests that mutations altering the structure and synthesis of the protein may be responsible for causing heritable forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether mutations within the human COL10A1 gene were responsible for causing the disorders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, hypochondroplasia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e>, and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, by analyzing the coding regions of the gene by using PCR and the single-stranded conformational polymorphism technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By this approach, seven sequence changes were identified within and flanking the coding regions of the gene of the affected persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that six of these sequence changes were not responsible for causing these forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> but were polymorphic in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sequence changes were used to demonstrate discordant segregation between the COL10A1 locus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e>, in nuclear families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This lack of segregation suggests that mutations within or near the COL10A1 locus are not responsible for these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The seventh sequence change resulted in a valine-to-methionine substitution in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the molecule and was identified in only two hypochondroplasic individuals from a single family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Segregation analysis in this family was inconclusive, and the significance of this substitution remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
