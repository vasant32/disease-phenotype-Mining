<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of postlaminectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> in skeletally immature achondroplasts and evaluate the need for concurrent fusion at multilevel decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>Spinal stenosis</z:hpo> is a relatively common complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most achondroplasts do not develop symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> until the third or fourth decades, some patients become symptomatic before skeletal maturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While postlaminectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> typically does not occur in the adult achondroplast, it is not known if it occurs in the skeletally immature achondroplast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The charts and radiographs of 10 consecutive skeletally immature achondroplasts that underwent surgical treatment for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> during a 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age of the 6 male and 4 female patients at surgery was 9.2 years (range 6-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preoperative lateral radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decompression consisted of multilevel (5-8) thoracolumbar laminectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of each medial facet was preserved bilaterally to maintain spinal stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postlaminectomy thoracolumbar kyphoses developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The postlaminectomy kyphoses ranged from 78 degrees to 135 degrees (mean 94 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusions</z:hpo> with instrumentation, performed from 10 months to 2.6 years after the decompressions, to stabilize the kyphoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Skeletally immature achondroplasts are at high risk for developing postlaminectomy thoracolumbar kyphoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> is indicated in skeletally immature achondroplasts who undergo thoracolumbar laminectomies of at least 5 levels </plain></SENT>
