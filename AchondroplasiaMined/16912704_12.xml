<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although 98% of ACH cases are accounted for by a single G380R substitution in the TM, a common mutation (N540K) in the TK1 region is detected in only 60-65% of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether the frequency of mutations in patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> was the result of incomplete mutation screening or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen exons of the FGFR3 gene were entirely sequenced in a cohort of 25 HCH and one ACH patients in whom common mutations had been excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven novel missense FGFR3 mutations were identified, one causing ACH and six resulting in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of these substitutions were located in the extracellular region and four of them creating additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi>, were associated with severe phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No mutations were detected in 19 clinically diagnosed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the spectrum of FGFR3 mutations causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limb dwarfism</z:hpo> is wider than originally recognised and emphasise the requirement for complete screening of the FGFR3 gene if appropriate genetic counselling is to be offered to patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> or ACH lacking the most common mutations and their families </plain></SENT>
