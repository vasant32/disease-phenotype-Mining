<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysed mutations include single nucleotide transitions, transversions, a deletion and a duplication in the following genes: CFTR (cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> transmembrane conductance regulator), COL4A5 (collagen type 4 alpha 5 chain), PKD1 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000113'>polycystic kidney disease</z:hpo> 1), and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood leukocyte genomic DNA was isolated, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then cleaved by Cleavase I enzyme at different temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrophoresis of the fragments on denaturing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel was followed by silver staining for 1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 mutations investigated were reproducibly detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CFLPA-SS proved to be a reliable method for mutation detection and more rapid than SSCA and HA </plain></SENT>
