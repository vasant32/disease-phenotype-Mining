<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is little mention in the literature of the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003099'>fibular overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the ratio of fibular to tibial length as a measurement of possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0003099'>fibular overgrowth</z:hpo>, we have related it to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002970'>genu varum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Full-length standing anteroposterior radiographs of 53 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 30 skeletally-immature and 23 skeletally-mature patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis was performed in order to determine if there was a causal relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003099'>fibular overgrowth</z:hpo> and the various indices of alignment of the lower limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis showed that the fibular to tibial length ratio had a significant correlation with the medial proximal tibial angle and the mechanical axial deviation in the skeletally-immature group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is a significant relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003099'>fibular overgrowth</z:hpo> and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002970'>genu varum</z:hpo> in the skeletally-immature achondroplastic patient </plain></SENT>
