<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two missense mutations in this codon are known to result in strong constitutive activation of the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase and cause three different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> syndromes-thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> type II (TD2) (A1948G [Lys650Glu]) and SADDAN (severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>) syndrome and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> type I (TD1) (both due to A1949T [Lys650Met]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other mutations within the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase domain (e.g., C1620A or C1620G [both resulting in Asn540Lys]) are known to cause hypochondroplasia, a relatively common but milder <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 90 individuals with suspected clinical diagnoses of hypochondroplasia who do not have Asn540Lys mutations, we screened for mutations, in FGFR3 exon 15, that would disrupt a unique BbsI restriction site that includes the Lys650 codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here the discovery of three novel mutations (G1950T and G1950C [both resulting in Lys650Asn] and A1948C [Lys650Gln]) occurring in six individuals from five families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several physical and radiological features of these individuals were significantly milder than those in individuals with the Asn540Lys mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Lys650Asn/Gln mutations result in constitutive activation of the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase but to a lesser degree than that observed with the Lys540Glu and Lys650Met mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that different amino acid substitutions at the FGFR3 Lys650 codon can result in several different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
