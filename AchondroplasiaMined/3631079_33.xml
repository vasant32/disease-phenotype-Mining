<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were determined for a historical cohort of achondroplastic individuals identified through the Medical Genetics Clinics of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality was increased at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, with an overall SMR of 2.27 (95% confidence interval 1.7-3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>Sudden death</z:hpo> accounted for the excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in those less than 4 years of age, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brain-stem compression</z:hpo> was identified as the cause in half of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and respiratory causes were not significantly increased but accounted for half of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in those 5-24 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SMRs were not significantly increased for those greater than 34 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> attributed to cardiovascular causes were increased in the 25-54-year-old age group, accounting for 10 of 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall cardiovascular SMR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval 2.5-9.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within this group, severe disability resulting from marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal canal stenosis</z:hpo> was present in a majority of individuals and may have been a contributing factor in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the bony abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>--i.e., foramen magnum and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal canal stenosis</z:hpo>--may have a significant effect on mortality at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages but particularly in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Efforts to minimize these complications are recommended </plain></SENT>
