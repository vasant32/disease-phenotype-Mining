<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imbalance in pelvic femoral muscles may account for this posture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the clinical significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>hyperlordosis</z:hpo>, its surgical treatment has not been well-described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current preliminary study, the authors compare two techniques used at the authors' institution for lower limb lengthening, one of which affects the correction of lumbosacral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>hyperlordosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had bilateral lower extremity lengthening procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had bilateral tibial lengthening and three patients had combined femoral and tibial lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ring external fixators were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>hyperlordosis</z:hpo> was assessed by comparing four radiographs with measurements in the sagittal plane obtained preoperatively with those at the latest followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the femoral lengthening group, the average preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> angle was 18 degrees, the lumbosacral joint angle was 12 degrees, the sacral inclination angle was 58.3 degrees, and the sacrohorizontal angle was 31 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean changes at the latest followup were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> angle (+1 degree), lumbosacral joint angle (+0.3 degrees), sacral inclination angle (-19 degrees), and sacrohorizontal angle (-15 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the tibia lengthening group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters were relatively unaltered at the last followup compared with their preoperative levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tibial lengthening had no effect on lumbosacral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>hyperlordosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, femoral lengthening resulted in an improved apparent lumbosacral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>hyperlordosis</z:hpo>, although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> angle was not changed significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The change in sacrum tilting provides a likely explanation for the improvement in cosmetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>hyperlordosis</z:hpo> observed in patients who have had femoral lengthening </plain></SENT>
