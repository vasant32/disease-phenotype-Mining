<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of them were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplastic dwarfs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their results were compared to those obtained from 103 lean and <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adults with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 32 dwarfs had distinctly greater RMR per kg fat-free mass by densitometry than adults with average stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a wide variation in the RMR among dwarfs, which was independent of leanness or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In spite of increased RMR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> among dysplastic adult dwarfs was twice as prevalent as among average-height adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased abdominal:hip ratios were prevalent among dwarfs, but these ratios do not reflect body fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body mass indices were worthless, and skinfold thicknesses and other anthropometric measurements were of very limited value in predicting the body fat of dwarfs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although our new and specific equations for estimating RMR and body composition give reasonable values, we recommend that the caloric requirements and body compositional variables be measured if nutritional therapy is needed to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> or gain in Little People </plain></SENT>
