<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>Skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> are a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> characterized by severe impairment of bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various forms of them add to produce a significant morbidity and mortality, yet no efficient drug therapy has been developed to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CNP), a member of the natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> family, is a potent stimulator of endochondral bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we exhibited that targeted overexpression of a CNP transgene in the growth plate rescued the impaired bone growth observed in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>), the most frequent form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, leading us to propose that CNP may prove to be an effective treatment for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to elucidate whether or not the systemic administration of CNP is a novel drug therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, we have investigated the effects of plasma CNP on impaired bone growth in <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> mice that specifically overexpress CNP in the liver under the control of human serum amyloid P component promoter or in those treated with a continuous CNP infusion system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that increased plasma CNP from the liver or by iv administration of synthetic CNP-22 rescued the impaired bone growth phenotype of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> mice without significant adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that treatment with systemic CNP is a potential therapeutic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, including <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>, in humans </plain></SENT>
