<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to the classical symptomatology of an enlarging head, with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo>, several patients presented symptoms related to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002677'>small foramen magnum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Respiratory problems and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> were also observed in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients who were treated by foramen magnum decompression showed remarkable improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological evaluation revealed a significant number of patients with dilated cortical sulci and basal cisterns, and mild <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ventricles on computerized tomography (CT) and/or ventriculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients showed signs of obstruction at the fourth ventricle outlets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some exhibited anomalous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of cerebral veins and dural sinuses, narrowing of the sinuses at the jugular foramen, and enlarged emissary veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunts were placed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the other children with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>large head</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>dilated ventricles</z:hpo>, head growth curves paralleled the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> slope, and there was no significant clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> or enlarging ventricles on follow-up CT scan </plain></SENT>
