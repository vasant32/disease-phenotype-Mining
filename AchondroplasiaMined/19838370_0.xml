<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) is the most frequent form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo>, caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It follows an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo>, though most cases are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular techniques are the only available methods to confirm the diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological features are only suggestive and not confirmatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to find out how often the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is verified on molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1998 through 2007, we carried out molecular analysis for the two common mutations in the FGFR3 gene in 130 cases clinically suspected to have ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diagnostic mutation was identified in 53 (40.8%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The common mutation (1138G&gt;A) was present in 50 (94.7%) of the positive cases, while the rare 1138 G&gt;C substitution was found in three (5.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that confirmation of clinical diagnosis of ACH by molecular genetic testing is essential to distinguish it from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, to plan therapeutic options, and to offer genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Management (medical and surgical) in patients confirmed to have ACH, is briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
