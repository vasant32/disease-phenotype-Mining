<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a cohort of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> undergoing thoracolumbar laminectomy and to examine if shorter time to surgery was related to improvement in long-term functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Data on the long-term benefits of laminectomy are mixed for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Earlier intervention may be associated with greater likelihood of long-term benefit, but quantified data are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 49 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who underwent primary laminectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients completed a questionnaire to assess symptoms, walking distance, and independence (per Modified Rankin Scale), before surgery and currently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responses were analyzed for the likelihood of improved walking distance or Rankin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patients had the following mean values: age, 37.7 ± 10.6 years; body mass index, 31.8 ± 5.5; symptom duration, 74.0 ± 100.1 months; preoperative symptom severity score, 2.7 ± 1.0 points; mean changes in blocks walked, +0.39 ± 2.0; and Rankin level, +0.08 ± 1.47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with a time-to-surgery interval of &lt;6 months were 7.13 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-36.66) more likely to experience improvement in walking distance and 4.00 times (95% CI, 1.05-15.21) more likely to experience Rankin level improvement than patients whose interval was &gt;6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intervals of up to 12 and 24 months were associated with increased likelihoods of 4.95 (95% CI, 1.41-17.41) and 3.43 (95% CI, 1.05-11.22), respectively, of improved walking distance compared with those with longer time-to surgery intervals, but those Rankin level improvements were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is an important predictor of long-term functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For sustained long-term postsurgical improvement, the window of opportunity might be relatively narrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> should seek medical advice for spinal stenotic symptoms as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
