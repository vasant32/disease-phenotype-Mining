<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Metatropic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> is a rare heritable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> that is thought to result from a defect in endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological studies have been few and have yielded inconsistent findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, no investigator has commented on the structure and function of the perichondral portion of the growth plate in patients who have metatropic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further characterize this disturbance, histological studies were carried out on autopsy specimens from the proximal part of the femur and the iliac crest of a patient who had this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major findings were: the absence of formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> primary spongiosa in the metaphysis; the presence of a thin seal of bone at the chondro-osseous junction, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003562'>abnormal metaphyseal vascular invasion</z:hpo> and arrest of endochondral growth; and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing perichondral ring structures with persistence of circumferential growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest an uncoupling of endochondral and perichondral growth and offer an explanation for the dumbbell-shaped morphological structure of the osseous metaphysis that is seen in patients who have metatropic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other observations included prominence of the cartilaginous canals and vascular channels in the reserve zone; clumping of chondrocytes with enhanced staining of the pericellular matrix in the proliferative zone; a decreased ratio of cells to matrix in the hypertrophic zone, with intracellular metachromatic granules and incomplete evolution of chondrocytes; complete absence of an alcian-blue-positive zone of provisional calcification; and, finally, islands of dysplastic chondrocytes in the metaphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities suggest that metatropic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> is not simply a disorder of endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There appear to be associated defects in the longitudinal proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes and in the production of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> matrix </plain></SENT>
