<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have sought to prevent these with a spinal orthosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report includes a description of the orthosis and an analysis of its use in achondroplastic children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen dwarfs between 11 and 52 months of age were fitted with a light truncal polyform orthosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect on the thoracolumbar (TL) and lumbosacral curves (LS) in the seated and standing child were compared by measurements made from lateral roentgenograms with and without the orthosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group mean reduction in TL curve of the seated dwarfs was 23 degrees (range 2 degrees to 73 degrees) and the reduction in the LS curve in the standing position was 15 degrees (range 1 degree to 44 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen older children aged 4-1/2 to 11-2/3 years were equipped with an <z:chebi fb="6" ids="28984">aluminum</z:chebi> version of the orthosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their TL curve sitting was reduced by a mean of 31 degrees (range 6 degrees to 45 degrees) and their LS curve standing was decreased by 16 degrees (range 6 degrees to 30 degrees) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one achondroplastic children and adults were braced for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> and/or neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most were relieved of their symptoms to some degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These and other data lead us to conclude that this form of treatment reduces deformity and alleviates symptoms </plain></SENT>
