<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of special sites in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene (FGFR3) are reported as a cause of ACH, and almost 98% of cases are caused by mutations in nucleotide 1138 (Gly380Arg), with 97% involving a c.1138G&gt;A mutation and 1% involving a c.1138G&gt;C mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the development of a simple, reliable, and rapid approach for molecular detection of nucleotide 1138 mutations is of great significance for prevention and early diagnosis of ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution melting (HRM) is a new, rapid, and inexpensive molecular detection method that has been generally applied to mutation scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, 12 cases of ACH, including 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases and 2 cases in a pedigree, were detected simultaneously using HRM analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were identified as carrying the c.1138 G&gt;A heterozygous mutation, and one case was identified as carrying the c.1138 G&gt;C heterozygous mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with RFLP-PCR, HRM analysis provided a more rapid, simpler, and less expensive approach for detecting the most common FGFR3 mutations carried by patients with ACH </plain></SENT>
