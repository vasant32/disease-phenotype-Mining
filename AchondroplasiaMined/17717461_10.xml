<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Longer treatment period in distraction osteogenesis (DO) of the lower extremity leads to more frequent complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed a new technique of transplantation of culture-expanded bone marrow cells (BMCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) during DO to accelerate new bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the efficacy of this cell therapy, retrospective comparative study was conducted between the bones treated with BMC and PRP and the bones treated without BMC and PRP during DO in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) and hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-six bones in 20 patients (ACH, 16; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, 4) that were lengthened in our hospital were divided into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four bones (femora, 12; tibiae, 12) in 11 patients (boys, 7; girls, 4) were treated with BMC and PRP transplantation (BMC-PRP group), whereas 32 bones (femora, 14; tibiae, 18) in 9 patients (boys, 3; girls, 6) did not undergo additional cell therapy (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parameters, including the age at operation, the increase in length, and the healing index, were compared between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was also compared between the femoral and tibial lengthenings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow cells (average number, +/- SD, 3.2 +/- 1.37 x 10 cells) and PRP (average platelet concentration +/- SD, 2.36 +/- 0.57 x 10 cells/muL) were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there were no significant differences in the age at operation and the length gained between the 2 groups, the average healing index of the BMC-PRP group (27.1 +/- 6.89 d/cm) was significantly lower than that of the control group (36.2 +/- 10.4 d/cm) (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The femoral lengthening showed significantly faster healing than did the tibial lengthening in the BMC-PRP group (P = 0.0092) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of BMC and PRP shortened the treatment period by accelerating new bone regeneration during DO of the lower extremity in patients with ACH and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, especially in the femoral lengthening </plain></SENT>
