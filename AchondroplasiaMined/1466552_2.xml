<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the modification and careful combination of standard techniques, i.e., frontofacial advancement, and Le Fort I and vertical mandibular osteotomy, a good correction has been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the problem clearly indicated the need for moving multiple components of the facial skeleton into new positions to provide correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The upper and lower midface required simultaneous movements in exactly opposite directions to normalize the skeletal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address the excess forehead height and projection, a modification of the usual frontofacial advancement was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rotation of the frontofacial segment forward inferiorly allowed correction of the orbital deficiency while also allowing shortening of the vertical forehead dimension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is a deviation from the straight linear advancement usually dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous retroposition and rotation of the maxilla allowed correction of the plane of occlusion while lengthening the midface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unique combination and application of standard techniques of craniofacial surgery in this patient allowed a very good result </plain></SENT>
