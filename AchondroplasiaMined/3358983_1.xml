<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (0.8-1.8 ng/ml), and sperm numbers in the testis and epididymis were not different between mutant animals and coisogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> mutants, except mocha and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mating behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> genotypes, fewer fertilized eggs were recovered from females mated by mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro fertilization tests showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutants--except bouncy--fertilized similar numbers of eggs to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spermatozoa from bouncy mutants also bound to eggs in lower numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that spermatozoa from the bouncy mutant have a severe defect in sperm-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e> interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When bouncy spermatozoa were tested for sperm-vitelline membrane interaction at a low (10:1) sperm to egg ratio, they penetrated fewer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">zona</z:e>-free hamster eggs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, while the regional pattern of protein synthesis was comparable among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutants, the absolute rate of protein synthesis (cpm per mg tissue) was lower in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the proportion of the proteins synthesized that appeared in the medium remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the regional profile of proteins secreted by mutants was compared to that of their coisogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp>, three types of differences were noted: (1) changes in the abundance of a protein, (2) changes in the region of the epididymis from which a protein was secreted, or (3) the absence of a protein </plain></SENT>
