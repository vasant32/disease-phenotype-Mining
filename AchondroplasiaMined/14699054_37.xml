<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis involves constitutive activation of FGFR3, which inhibits proliferation and differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that activating mutations in FGFR3 increase the stability of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the mutations disrupt c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-mediated ubiquitination that serves as a targeting signal for lysosomal degradation and termination of receptor signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The defect allows diversion of actively signaling receptors from lysosomes to a recycling pathway where their survival is prolonged, and, as a result, their signaling capacity is increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lysosomal targeting defect is additive to other mechanisms proposed to explain the pathogenesis of ACH </plain></SENT>
