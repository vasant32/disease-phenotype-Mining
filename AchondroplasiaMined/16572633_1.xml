<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the pediatric population, stenosis and compression at the level of the cervicomedullary junction commonly occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal in this study was to assess the outcomes in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who underwent cervicomedullary decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three pediatric patients with heterozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005468'>foramen magnum stenosis</z:hpo> underwent 45 cervicomedullary decompressions at the authors' institution over an 11-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgical decompression, complete resolution or partial improvement in the preoperative symptoms was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical morbidity rate was low and usually consisted of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in patients in whom the dura mater had been opened (either intentionally or accidentally) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This problem was successfully managed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with local measures (wound oversewing) or CSF diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this review the authors demonstrate that decompression of the cervicomedullary junction in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> may be accomplished safely with significant clinical benefit and minimal morbidity </plain></SENT>
