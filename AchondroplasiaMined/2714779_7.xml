<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absence of type II collagen, a decrease in the amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> (PG), and structural changes in PG, namely, increased electrophoretic mobility of PG, lower relative content of chondroitin 4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> (Ch4-S), lower molecular weight and decreased total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> (ChS) sulfation, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased amounts of type I and type III collagens, atypical for hyaline cartilage, were revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the link proteins (LPs), a large protein with a mol. wt. of 48 kDa was predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular and cellular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of achondrogenesis ("chondrogenesis imperfecta") are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data obtained suggest that the primary defect in type II achondrogenesis involves ChS or type II collagen synthesis </plain></SENT>
