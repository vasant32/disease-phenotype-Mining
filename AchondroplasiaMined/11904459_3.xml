<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) indicate that FGFR3 also can act as an oncogene, and mutation of codon 249 in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene was recently detected in 3/12 primary cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analysed 91 cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> for this specific S249C mutation using amplification created restriction site methodology (ACRS), and detected no mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on 73 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced protein staining was seen in 43 (58.8%) samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (8.2%) revealed increased protein staining compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cervical tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients had a better prognosis than those with reduced or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels, although not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report weakens the hypothesis of FGFR3 as an oncogene of importance in cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
