<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before surgery, every patient was evaluated with plain radiography; after surgery, every patient was evaluated at weekly or biweekly intervals with standard plain anteroposterior and lateral radiography, with acquisition of additional radiographs centered over the distraction site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Every patient had complete bone healing, which took 3-14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, new bone formation was evident within 15 weeks after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications associated with the Ilizarov technique were minimal (delayed formation in two cases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> formation within the distraction site in two cases), but success relies heavily on radiographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiographs of the whole bone or joint must be obtained for overall assessment of bone alignment; specific views of the distraction site, with the x-ray beam centered over this site, may be required </plain></SENT>
