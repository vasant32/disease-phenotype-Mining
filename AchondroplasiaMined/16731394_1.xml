<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, the value of oral mucosal reflectance in identifying unaffected parents of ACH patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> mutations was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study involved ACH children (n = 30), unaffected ACH parents (n = 60), and a sex- and age-matched controls (control children, n = 30; control parents, n = 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light reflectance of the lower gingival and vestibular oral mucosa was measured using an imaging reflectance system in the optical spectrum (400-700 nm wavelengths) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher reflectance values in the 410 to 630 nm wavelength range were observed in ACH patients (P &lt; or = .0063), whereas significantly lower reflectance values over the whole optical spectrum were observed in ACH parents (P &lt; or = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reflectance cutoff value &lt; or =4.71% at the 430 nm wavelength identified ACH parents with 100% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the presence of previously unrecognized oral mucosal reflectance abnormalities in unaffected ACH parents of ACH children </plain></SENT>
