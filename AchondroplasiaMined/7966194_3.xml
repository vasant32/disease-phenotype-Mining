<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mother has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and the father has pseudoachondroplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, which he had inherited from his father </plain></SENT>
