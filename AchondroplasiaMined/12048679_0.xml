<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The genomic DNA from 17 clinically diagnosed ACH patients where analysed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP) with Sfc I and Msp I restriction endonucleases and by PCR-DGGE technique for screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: G to A transition mutation at nucleotide 1138 was detected in 14/17 of the ACH patients as heterozygotes by PCR-RFLP with Sfc I digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No 1138 G to C transition was detected by Msp I digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 14 samples with G to A mutation were also found to be positive for point mutation by PCR-DGGE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mutation was detected in 3 negative samples by PCR-RFLP, implying that there was actually no point mutation in this amplified region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nucleotide 1138 in transmembrane domain of FGFR3 gene is the hot point for mutation in ACH and hence its major pathologic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PCR-DGGE is a sensitive and reliable technique for point mutation screening, especially for the heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
