<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of investigating events of energy metabolism in growing cartilages of human tubular and nontubular bones, measurements of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase of freshly excised cartilages in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic conditions were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of cartilage CK of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> phalanges (tubular bone) and <z:mp ids='MP_0009877'>exostosis</z:mp> was significantly less than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> iliac bones (nontubular bone) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> tubular bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar difference was also found between the tubular and the nontubular bone of an autopsy subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference in the levels of LDH and aldolase in the cartilage between the tubular and the nontubular bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations together with results obtained from iliac and limb cartilages of the newborn rat suggest the hypothesis that CK activity of cartilage of the tubular and the nontubular bone is different; cartilage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> tubular bone has CK activity similar to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nontubular bone cartilage </plain></SENT>
