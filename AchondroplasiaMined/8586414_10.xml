<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest its important role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, mutation in Fgfr3 is responsible for growth disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, hypoachondroplasia, and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the complete genomic organization of the mouse Fgfr3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The murine gene spans approximately 15 kb and consists of 19 exons and 18 introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One major and one minor transcription initiation site were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Position +1 is located 614 nucleotides upstream from the ATG initiation codon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The translation initiation and termination sites are located in exons 2 and 19, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five Sp1 sites, two AP2 sites, one Zeste site, and one Krox 24 site were observed in the 5'-flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Fgfr3 promoter appears to be contained within a CpG island and, as is common in genes having multiple Sp1-binding sites, lacks a TATA box </plain></SENT>
