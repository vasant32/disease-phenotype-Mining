<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two bones of the cranial base were markedly reduced in length but not in width </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage reduction in the basisphenoid was twice that in the basioccipital bone and of the same magnitude as that previously observed in the long bones of the limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This difference may arise because the basisphenoid, like the long bones, grows in length from two cartilaginous growth sites while the basioccipital grows from one cartilaginous and one periosteal site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mandible of the cn/cn mice was also reduced in size, although to a lesser extent than were the cranial bones and without the ensuing disproportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The scale of the mandibular changes suggests that they are largely attributable to regulatory responses to the shortened cranium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding that the condylar cartilage of the cn/cn mice is reduced in thickness indicates, however, that the cn gene may have a direct effect on condylar chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
