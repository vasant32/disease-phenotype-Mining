<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> based exclusively on the sonographic measurements of the fetal skeleton is difficult and has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a newborn infant with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> who was born to a mother with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) and a father with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial sonographic measurements were recorded from 16 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> up to 22 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 25 weeks of gestation, the long bones began to appear shorter than expected for gestational age, while the head measurements (biparietal diameter and head circumference) remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The measurements were sufficiently different to distinguish from findings in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and achondroplastic fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that it is possible to distinguish the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetus from a fetus affected with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and to distinguish <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> and ACH from each other based on the sonographic measurements alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of longitudinal sonographic measurements of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> in the second and third trimesters </plain></SENT>
