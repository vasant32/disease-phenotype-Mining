<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine through the measurement of different angles the correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar hyperlordosis</z:hpo> after bilateral femoral lengthening using the Icatme technique and to assess the absence of neurological symptomatology secondary to stenosis of the lumbar canal after femoral lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 22.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent femoral lengthening using the Icatme technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>X rays of the lateral rachis taken before and after lengthening were used to measure a series of angles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar lordosis</z:hpo> angle, Sez's angle and the L5S1 angle decreased while the lumbosacral angle, Jungham's angle and the sacrum angle increased, leading to correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar hyperlordosis</z:hpo>, verticalization of the sacrum and improvement in thoracolumbar and lumbosacral inflection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Values were similar to the standard for individuals without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Femoral lengthening using the Icatme technique in achondroplastics modifies the statics of the lumbar spine, making them similar to those of nonachondroplastics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedure corrects <z:hpo ids='HP_0002938'>lumbar hyperlordosis</z:hpo> and prevents the appearance of neurological symptomatology due to stenosis of the lumbar canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of neurological complications due to stenosis of the lumbar canal in achondroplastics who have undergone femoral lengthening is low compared with that of achondroplastics of the same age and sex who have not undergone this procedure </plain></SENT>
