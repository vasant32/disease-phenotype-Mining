<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>Spinal stenosis</z:hpo> is a common complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no study has evaluated a greater than 2-year outcome after surgical intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> in such children or compared decompression with and without instrumentation in relation to revision surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to assess the efficacy of lumbar decompression and instrumentation for symptomatic stenosis in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our institution's database to identify children (&lt; or =18 y old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> undergoing initial spinal decompression for lumbar stenosis from 1995 through 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 18 such patients and reviewed their medical records for demographic data, presenting signs and symptoms, and treatment and outcome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 72.0+/-27.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined each patient's symptom score (SS) based on presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp>, numbness, or pain; abnormal reflexes; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>; and walking intolerance (unable to walk &gt; or =5 blocks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each finding was scored 1 point (6 points maximum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients requiring revision surgery were assigned a revision postoperative SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were contacted at the end of data collection and assigned a final follow-up SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline SS values were compared with postoperative, revision postoperative, and final follow-up scores using a paired t test (alpha=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean preoperative and final SS values were significantly different: 4.0+/-0.9 (most common symptoms, <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">incontinence</z:e>) and 1.6+/-1.7 (most common symptom, <z:mp ids='MP_0009434'>leg weakness</z:mp>), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent decompression with instrumentation initially; 9 did not; 7 of the latter required instrumentation during revision; and 2 of the former also required revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Those without initial instrumentation were 3.5 times more likely (odds ratio=12.3) to require revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical decompression with instrumentation significantly reduced the symptoms of lumbar stenosis and the likelihood of revision surgery in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III therapeutic study </plain></SENT>
