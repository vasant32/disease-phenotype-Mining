<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there are more than 10,000 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> living in the United States, there has been little study of their quality of life (QOL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this study, surveys were collected from 189 individuals affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH) and 136 unaffected first-degree relatives (FDRs) of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individuals affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> had lower annual income, less education, and were less likely to be married than FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They also differed significantly in their perceptions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, with FDRs believing that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is a more serious condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total QOL indices and indices in each of four QOL subdomains were significantly lower in affected individuals than in relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When controlling for demographic characteristics and affected status, having lower self-esteem scores and perceiving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> as more serious were the independent factors most highly associated with lower QOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A qualitative analysis of open responses to questions about the advantages and disadvantages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> revealed that individuals were as likely to cite disadvantages relating to social barriers as they were to cite those relating to health and functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We interpret the low QOL scores to reflect the social challenges that individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> regularly experience in the average-sized world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetics professionals should consider sources of lower QOL for affected individuals in their counseling sessions to acknowledge the relative importance of non-medical contributions </plain></SENT>
