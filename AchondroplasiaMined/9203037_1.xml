<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravenous urography (IVU) revealed bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268804" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hydroureteronephrosis</z:e> with markedly <z:mp ids='MP_0000539'>distended urinary bladder</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regular three hourly intermittent catheterization was advised, and the parents and carers of this child agreed to perform catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was cessation of urine leak within 48 hours of urethral drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cystography performed two weeks later showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000076'>vesicoureteric reflux</z:hpo>; vesicoumbilical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was no longer demonstrable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up IVU, performed after eight and half months of regular intermittent catheterization, showed regression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268804" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hydroureteronephrosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that urine leakage from the umbilicus served two important protective functions in this child, viz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(1) it prevented possible vesical or renal rupture; (2) the striking clinical symptom of urine leak from the umbilicus focussed the attention of the carers to the underlying serious condition of the urinary tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, this case demonstrates that regression of marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268804" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hydroureteronephrosis</z:e> can be achieved by intermittent catheterization performed at regular intervals by devoted parents/carers, in selected cases of spinal cord injury with <z:mp ids='MP_0005302'>neuropathic bladder</z:mp>, and vesical outlet obstruction, thus obviating the need for any form of temporary or permanent urinary diversion </plain></SENT>
