<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effects of these extracts on the growth of the 13 day-old bpH/bpH embryo tibia rudiments were studied in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the limb buds of the 11- and 12 day-old mouse embryos contain a factor regulating bpH gene expression in differentiating cartilage cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This factor is present in the postaxial part of the limb bud and is absent in its preaxial one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the extract from the limb bud postaxial parts of the 12 day-old +/+ embryos is added to culture medium, the expression of bpH gene is observed in cultured tibia rudiments of the 13 day-old bpH/bpH embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extraxt from the limb bud preaxial parts of the 12 day-old +/+ embryos does not affect the growth of tibia rudiments of mutant embryos in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The regulator factor does not induce bpH gene expression in cultured bone rudiments of the 14 day-old bpH/bpH embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is obvious that bpH locus does not act in cartilage cells of developing tibia after the 14th day of embryogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the factor regulating bpH gene expression to heating and proteolytic enzymes suggests its protein nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The molecular weight of this protein is from 15 000 to 25 000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Experiments with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> show that this factor regulates the expression of bpH at the post-transcriptional level </plain></SENT>
