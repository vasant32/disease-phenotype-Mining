<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene are present in a significant proportion of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reports of prenatal diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> are very rare and the phenotype/genotype correlation in these patients is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases with second trimester ultrasound findings consistent with a diagnosis of a non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005716'>lethal skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound evaluation after 23 weeks of gestation showed a decreased rate of development of the femora (femur length &lt;fifth centile), while biparietal diameter, abdominal circumference, and foot length were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Femur length/foot and femur length/abdominal circumference ratios were &lt;0.87 and &lt;0.18, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prenatal cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and FGFR3 G380R mutation characteristic of ACH was excluded in both fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis carried out retrospectively revealed that both fetuses were heterozygous for the C1620A mutation resulting in N540K substitution in FGFR3, the most common mutation in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combination of ultrasound and molecular genetic approach is helpful for establishing an accurate diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> in utero and subsequently for appropriate genetic counseling and perinatal management </plain></SENT>
