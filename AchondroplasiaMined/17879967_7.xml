<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increase in overall mortality, age specific mortality up to age 34 years and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>-related mortality was first reported in a 1987 study of a large population of ACH individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since this study, concern about premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, particularly in young adults, has persisted in the ACH population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to follow-up the patterns of mortality in a more contemporaneous ACH population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vital status of 718 ACH individuals from the original study and 75 new ACH individuals was determined through the search of two computerized mortality database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the overall mortality and age-specific mortality at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages remained significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were similar across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 42 years of follow-up suggesting that higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were still occurring in the contemporary ACH population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Heart disease</z:e>-related mortality, between ages 25 and 35, was more than 10 times higher than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and the average life expectancy for this ACH population were decreased by 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that despite advances in the knowledge of the natural history of ACH and health care needs of this population, mortality remains significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> illustrates the need to identify risk factors in the ACH population and develop treatment interventions accordingly </plain></SENT>
