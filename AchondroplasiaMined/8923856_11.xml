<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study lasted 24 months and included 6 months of observation, 12 months of hGH therapy (0.04 mg/kg.day), and 6 months of posttreatment growth rate determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the mean growth rate during the hGH treatment (5.3 +/- 1.6 cm) was significantly increased compared with that during the pretreatment (4.0 +/- 1.0 cm.yr, P &lt; 0.01)) and posttreatment periods (3.1 +/- 1.3 cm; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 4 children with hypochondroplasia, the growth rate during hGH treatment was 7.0 +/- 2.4 cm/yr and 4.9 +/- 1.5 cm/yr during the pre- and posttreatment periods, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, there was a significant increase in growth rate of only the lower segment (from 1.1 +/- 1.6 cm/yr to 3 +/- 1.2 cm/yr, P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant acceleration in the growth of the upper segment and of the scanogram measurements of the long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No untoward effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recombinant hGH increases short-term growth velocity in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>/hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, this treatment does not seem to have a lesser effect on limbs than on trunk growth rate and, therefore, during 1 yr of treatment, does not increase body disproportion </plain></SENT>
