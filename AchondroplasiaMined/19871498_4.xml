<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is present at birth and is characterized by size reduction, by a disproportion of bodily parts, most marked in the extremities, and by an invariably lethal effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals are still-born or die very shortly after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In physical appearance and in the character of the skeletal changes as shown by x-ray photographs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in the rabbit has a remarkable resemblance to the disease in man and in cattle and dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The condition which first occurred in offspring of pure bred Havana rabbits is inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In anticipation of the later discussion of this phase of the study (13), it can be stated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> is on the basis of a simple recessive unit factor and that the appearance of non-achondroplastic transmitters (heterozygotes) is that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
