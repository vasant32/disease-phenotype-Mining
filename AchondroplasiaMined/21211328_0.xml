<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: six consecutive cases of 3 males and 3 females were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average age at surgery was 18.5 years old with a range of 12 to 36 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> and lumbar stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients had neurological deficits due to severe spinal deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posterior osteotomy and decompression were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long cassette supine radiographs were taken before and after surgery and at the final follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, neurological outcomes (JOA (Japanese Orthopedic Association) scores) and operative complications were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the average follow-up was 10.2 months with a range of 5 to 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average operative duration was 320 min with a mean 1300 ml of blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average number of fusion segments was 8 with a range of 5 to 10 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo> was corrected from 53.3° to 13.3° with a 75.0% correction rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average preoperative JOA score was 4.5 points and improved to 8.5 points at the final follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: posterior osteotomy and decompression is a preferred surgical regiment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> and lumbar stenosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
