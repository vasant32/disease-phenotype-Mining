<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous articles published in this journal, I discussed the roles of people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> in ancient Egyptian civilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article I, along with my Egyptian and American colleagues, describe two skeletons of dwarfs that date to 2700-2184 BCE and were unearthed from a funerary complex near the Great Pyramids in Giza </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first skeleton belongs to a high official, Per-ni-ankh-w, who died between 45 and 50 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His statue is on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second skeleton belongs to a pregnant female worker found with a fetus in situ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her estimated age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 25-30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She most likely died during childbirth due to a small pelvic outlet as supported by her narrow sacrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fetal bones appear <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radiological examination of both skeletons confirmed the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ancient Egyptians concerned themselves with the search for spiritual fulfillment through the tradition of moral teachings </plain></SENT>
