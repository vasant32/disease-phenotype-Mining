<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Erythropoiesis was investigated in 32 children wih <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> and in eight children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> by studying blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in relation to growth and to serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and erythropoietin (EPO) before, during, and after 12 months of recombinant human growth hormone (GH) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was positively correlated with relative body height and with serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels (P = .001 to .02), but not with the concentrations of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-dependency of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and their responses to GH treatment were similar in the patients with GH deficiency and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GH secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GH accelerated growth and elevated the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, body mass increased similarly, but gain in height was less than in the other patients, and the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was markedly pronounced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group, the correlations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 were extremely close (r = 0.80 to 0.85, P = .031 to .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are in accord with earlier observations from in vitro and animal studies, and suggest that the GH-IGF axis is involved in the physiologic elevation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels during childhood </plain></SENT>
