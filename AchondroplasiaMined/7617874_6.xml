<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine if and at what gestational age prenatal ultrasonography (US) enables distinction between homozygous, heterozygous, and unaffected fetuses when both parents have heterozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serial US scans of 15 fetuses at 25% risk of homozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Femoral growth curves were established and compared with published standards to determine the gestational age, calculated according to biparietal diameter (BPD), at which femoral length crossed below the 3rd percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence and severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were determined clinically after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Femoral length crossed the 3rd percentile at 14.0-16.5 weeks BPD age (mean, 15.6 weeks) in the four homozygous fetuses and at 18.2-26.2 weeks BPD age (mean, 21.5 weeks) in the eight heterozygous fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the three unaffected fetuses, femoral length did not cross percentiles as gestational age increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Establishment of a femoral growth curve in the second trimester with serial US scans enables prenatal distinction between homozygous, heterozygous, and unaffected fetuses when both parents have heterozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
