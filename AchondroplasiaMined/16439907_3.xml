<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 150 anteroposterior standing radiographs of the lower extremities were randomly selected for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radiographs were divided into three groups according to age: group 1, younger than 6 years of age; group 2, 6 to 10 years of age; group 3, older than 10 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement for the medial proximal tibial angle and the lateral distal tibial angle measurements were poor (0.32 and 0.38, respectively) in group 1, but agreement increased between observers with increasing patient age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good to excellent intraobserver reproducibility was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, except measurement of the medial proximal tibial angle in group 1, where the results were poor (0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant measurement errors in the proximal and distal tibial joint lines are possible in children less than 6 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
