<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two achondroplastic infants had small foramina magna with lethal compression of the corresponding upper cervical spinal cords </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The damage was histologically comparable to the hyperextension type of spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An anterior displacement of the foramen magnum was demonstrated in one of the two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The displacement is considered worthy of future verification as it may be an additional factor in susceptibility to hyperextension injury to the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second patient survived 6 months, demonstrating that not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> upper cervical spinal cord injuries are immediately fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who have sublethal lesions are potentially salvageable by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is also speculated that there might be more cases of nonlethal upper cervical spinal-cord damage in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, especially in early infancy when infants are unable to hold their heads erect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of slight upper cervical spinal cord damage is not known, although it is considered rare at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a result of the findings in these two cases, it is suggested that hyperextension of the head be avoided, when possible </plain></SENT>
