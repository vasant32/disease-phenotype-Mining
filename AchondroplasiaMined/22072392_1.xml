<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FGFR3 is a tyrosine kinase receptor and constitutive FGFR3 activation impairs endochondral ossification and triggers severe disorganization of the cartilage with shortening of long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To decipher the role of FGFR3 in endochondral ossification, we analyzed the impact of a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> (TKI), A31, on both human and mouse mutant FGFR3-expressing cells and on the skeleton of Fgfr3(Y367C/+) dwarf mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that A31 inhibited constitutive FGFR3 phosphorylation and restored the size of embryonic dwarf femurs using an ex vivo culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in length of the treated mutant femurs was 2.6 times more than for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premature cell cycle exit and defective chondrocyte differentiation were observed in the Fgfr3(Y367C/+) growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A31 restored <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of cell cycle regulators (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, KI67, cyclin D1 and p57) and allowed pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes to properly differentiate into hypertrophic chondocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data reveal a specific role for FGFR3 in the cell cycle and chondrocyte differentiation and support the development of TKIs for the treatment of FGFR3-related <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
