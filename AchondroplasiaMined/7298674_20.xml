<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and 24 with hypochondroplasia have been reviewed in order to clarify the differences between the two disorders and establish the height, body proportions and other clinical and radiological variations within each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of the "classical" findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> are not always present, and hypochondroplasia at its most severe is indistinguishable from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> at its least severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> and neurological complications was established in an unselected group of 27 achondroplastic and 12 hypochondroplastic patients aged 10 years and over </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only three of the former were free of symptoms but only three developed serious complications (11 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of radiographs of the lumbar canal did not in general correlate well with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> symptoms, but it was found that the ratio of interpedicular distances at the first and fourth lumbar vertebrae had some value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological complications were rare in patients with simple narrowing of the spinal canal or with persistence of a thoracolumbar kyphos but when these occurred together there was a high risk of serious neurological involvement </plain></SENT>
