<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>COMP is a large pentameric <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> found predominantly in the extracellular matrix of cartilage, tendon, and ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a modular protein, it is composed of a coiled-coil domain, four type II (T2) repeats, eight type III (T3) repeats, and a large globular C-terminal domain (CTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority (&gt;85%) of COMP mutations causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> or MED are found in the exons encoding the T3 repeats, and the disease mechanism has been characterised in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Much less is known about disease-causing mutations in the CTD; in 10 years only seven mutations have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe eight novel and two recurrent mutations that we have recently identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> or MED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these mutations result in a spectrum of disease, ranging from mild MED to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mapping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known COMP CTD mutations on a three-dimensional model of the C-terminal domain shows that the CTD mutations cluster in two distinct regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These regions are probably important in stabilising the T3-CTD structure and mediating intra- or intermolecular interactions </plain></SENT>
