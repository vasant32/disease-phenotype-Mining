<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fact that certain de novo human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) increase in incidence with the age of the father is consistent with this idea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although it is assumed that the paternal age effect is the result of an increasing frequency of mutant sperm as a man grows older, no direct molecular measurement of the germ-line mutation frequency has been made to confirm this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using sperm DNA from donors of different ages, we determined the frequency of the nucleotide substitution in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the magnitude of the increase in mutation frequency with age appears insufficient to explain why older fathers have a greater chance of having a child with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of alternatives may explain this discrepancy, including selection for sperm that carry the mutation or an age-dependent increase in premutagenic lesions that remain unrepaired in sperm and are inefficiently detected by the PCR assay </plain></SENT>
