<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a minority, a fixed and angular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> develops, which can cause serious neurologic sequelae later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed a protocol for preventing development of such fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> in a sequential, unselected series of 66 infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the efficacy of early prohibition of unsupported sitting and, in those in whom such prohibition proves insufficient, use of bracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the proposed algorithm was followed, none of the infants had development of a progressive kyphotic deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On this basis, it appears that the secondary risks of angular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, previously estimated to be between 10 and 15% in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, can be completely eliminated </plain></SENT>
