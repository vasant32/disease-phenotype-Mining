<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>Skeletal anomalies</z:hpo> were leading among the group (46.29%), followed by genitourinary (GU) defects (12.14%) and neural tube <z:mpath ids='MPATH_71'>fusion defects</z:mpath> (NTFD) (11.21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (LBW) was 6% among the studied group of newborns and 26.56% among the group with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
