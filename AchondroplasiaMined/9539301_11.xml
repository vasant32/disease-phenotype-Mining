<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although there are a few reports on GH therapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, these were based on a small sample and/or short-term observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the effectiveness of GH treatment on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and hypochondroplasia, a long-term treatment study in a larger number of patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty-two children (16 males and 26 females, age 3-14 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, we evaluated hypothalamic-pituitary function and point mutation analysis as previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the evaluation, the children were treated with GH for more than 2 years; then post-treatment growth velocity and body proportion parameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 35 typical variants of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients showed previously reported point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual height gain during GH therapy was significantly greater than that before therapy (3.9 +/- 1.0 cm/year before treatment vs 6.5 +/- 1.8 cm/year for the first year and 4.6 +/- 1.6 cm/year for the second year of treatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The body disproportion had not been aggravated during the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that GH might be beneficial in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> in the first 2 years of treatment </plain></SENT>
