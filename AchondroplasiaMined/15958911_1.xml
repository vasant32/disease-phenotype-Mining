<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To date, the only way to predict adult height in achondroplastic dwarves has been to consult a growth chart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether the multiplier method of predicting adult height at skeletal maturity in healthy persons can be applied to persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the multiplier method can be applied to lower limb length, upper limb length, total height, foot length, and foot height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the growth pattern for total height in achondroplastic dwarves might also be characterized by a multiplier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total height multipliers for achondroplastic dwarves ("<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> height multipliers") were calculated from two separate databases by dividing height at maturity by height at each respective age for both genders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Little variability was found among multipliers for each age and among multipliers calculated from different databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upper torso (sitting height) multipliers and lower limb multipliers were also derived for achondroplastic dwarves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lower limb and total height growth rates were slower in achondroplastic dwarves compared with healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, sitting height multipliers for achondroplastic dwarves were closely related to sitting height multipliers for healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because these findings showed that the multiplier values were independent of population and percentile, the multiplier method may be a valid method for quickly predicting height at any age for achondroplastic dwarves </plain></SENT>
