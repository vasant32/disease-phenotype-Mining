<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The receptor tyrosine kinase p185c-neu can be constitutively activated by the transmembrane domain mutation Val664--&gt;Glu, found in the oncogenic mutant p185neu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This mutation is predicted to allow intermolecular hydrogen bonding and receptor dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Understanding the activation of p185c-neu has assumed greater relevance with the recent observation that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common genetic form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, is caused by a similar transmembrane domain mutation that activates fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have isolated novel transforming derivatives of p185c-neu using a large pool of degenerate oligonucleotides encoding variants of the transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several of the transforming isolates identified were unusual in that they lacked a Glu at residue 664, and others were unique in that they contained multiple Glu residues within the transmembrane domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Glu residues in the transforming isolates often exhibited a spacing of seven residues or occurred in positions likely to represent the helical interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the distinction between the sequences of the transforming clones and the nontransforming clones did not suggest clear rules for predicting which specific sequences would result in receptor activation and transformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate these requirements further, entirely novel transmembrane sequences were constructed based on tandem repeats of simple heptad sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation was achieved by transmembrane sequences such as [VVVEVVA]n or [VVVEVVV]n, whereas activation was not achieved by a transmembrane domain consisting only of Val residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the context of these transmembrane domains, Glu or Gln were equally activating, while Lys, Ser, and Asp were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using transmembrane domains with two Glu residues, the spacing between these was systematically varied from two to eight residues, with only the heptad spacing resulting in receptor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in the context of activating mutations in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3 that are responsible for the human developmental syndromes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
