<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These novel weight for age, gender-specific growth curves for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients from birth through 16 years were constructed from a longitudinal, retrospective, single observer cohort study of 334 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Weight for age data from 301 subjects in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> cohort, constituting 1,964 total weight measurements, are presented in these weight for age curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percentiles (5, 25, 50, 75, 95th) were estimated across the age continuum by gender, using a 1 month window (+/-0.5 months) around each time point of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percentiles were smoothed using a quadratic, penalized smoother by a semi-parametric model approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Raw weight data from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> cohort are compared to that of average stature children presented in the current CDC growth curves, divided into 0-36 months and 2-16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was overlap of birth weight between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and average stature infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This statistical modeling method can be applied to other anthropometric parameters collected from this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> cohort (e.g., length, BMI), other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> diagnoses, and to syndromic, non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> diagnoses which may benefit from standardization of weight for age </plain></SENT>
