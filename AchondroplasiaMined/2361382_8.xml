<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured chest dimensions, spirometry, lung volumes, maximal expiratory flow volume curves, nasal and airways resistance, closing volume, maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures, and tracheal area by acoustic reflection in 12 healthy subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anterior-posterior thoracic diameter was mildly reduced in men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vital capacity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was 108 percent +/- 18.6 percent (SD) of that predicted for achondroplastic subjects, but was reduced when compared with values for people of average stature that were predicted, based on either sitting height or thoracic height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction was relatively greater in male than in female subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RV/TLC and FRC/TLC ratios were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other measurements were similar to those in average-statured adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> results in a reduction in vital capacity out of proportion to what would be expected if these subjects had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limb size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the lungs may be small, they are functionally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, as are the airways </plain></SENT>
