<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical severity ranges from mildly affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> to lethal forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spranger classified approximately 200 different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> in 1992, based on the clinical and radiographic features and the mode of genetic transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Etiopathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> is better documented now, with rapid accumulation of knowledge concerning defective genes and proteins causing this group of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> may cause defects in the synthesis of structural proteins and in metabolic pathways, degradation of macromolecules, growth factors and receptors and transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Classifications by the International Working Group on Constitutional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005940" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Diseases of Bone</z:e> were based on the mutations in the same group gene taking into consideration the clinical and radiological findings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> group, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with <z:mp ids='MP_0000063'>decreased bone density</z:mp> group and type II collagenopathies...) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations and radiological investigations are crucial for the differential diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, prenatal diagnosis and postnatal definitive diagnosis are most often achieved by molecular analysis of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these groups of disorders require management by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, including pediatricians, genetic specialists, orthopedists and psychiatrists </plain></SENT>
