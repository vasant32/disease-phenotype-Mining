<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To review the results of distraction osteogenesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short-stature</z:hpo> patients in our centre and analyse outcomes including complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University teaching hospital, Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> (three had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, three constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, and two hypochondroplasia) operated on for limb lengthening using monolateral or circular external fixators between 1995 and 2006 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at the time of surgery was 20 years (range, 9-39 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fixators used were either Ilizarov or Orthofix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average gain in length per bone segment was 5.2 cm (range, 3.2-8.0 cm), and the average percentage lengthening was 21% (range, 7.9-40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time in frame was 8 months (range, 4-14 months), and the average healing index was 48 days per cm of lengthening (18-110 days per cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Minor complications (pin tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001387'>joint stiffness</z:hpo>) were common, and after excluding the latter the overall complication rate was 0.6 per bone segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our series, limb lengthening of up to 40% of the initial length of the bone segment can be achieved without significant long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the procedures were complex and prolonged, and required a special psychological approach directed at both parents and the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications are quite common, for which patients have to be well prepared before starting the procedures </plain></SENT>
