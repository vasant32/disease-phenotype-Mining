<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 48-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of progressive gait deterioration over a period of 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had been treated by hemodialysis for 14 years after bilateral nephrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She originally suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Otherwise she was a healthy woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination showed <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and hypesthesia below C5, accelerated deep tendon reflexes and inability in walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> from C4 to C6 due to an epidural isointensity mass located in the ventral surface of the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mass was enhanced by a contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anterior decompression followed by an autogenous vertebral bone graft at C4/5 and C5/6 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The posterior longitudinal ligament was remarkably thickened resulting in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histologically this thick ligament contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> both in the superficial and deep layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ossification was not noticed in the ligament </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the posterior longitudinal ligament (HPLL) was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HPLL is known to be frequently associated with herniated intervertebral discs or segmental ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>Myelopathy</z:hpo> in this patient with long-term hemodialysis was aggravated by HPLL without ossification due to imbalance of systemic metabolism such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The authors report a unique case of HPLL caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> as one of the complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodialysis with special emphasis on its pathophysiology and management </plain></SENT>
