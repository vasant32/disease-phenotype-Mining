<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The critical (sensitive) period for production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> began on day 5 of incubation and ended at the start of HH stage 35 (8.5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The end of the critical period was accurately timed and found to be 205-207 hours of incubation and to coincide with a 66% decrease in growth rate of the embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment resulted in reduced tibial growth one day later, tibial angulation two days later, and chrondrocytic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> four days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last was therefore not the cause of the angulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tibias were taken from <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi>-treated and control donor embryos of various ages and grafted to the chorioallantoic membranes of treated and control host embryos of various ages during and outside the critical period and achondroplastic changes induced in grafted tibias exposed to <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> while on the chorioallantoic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The critical period was extended into day 10 of incubation in such grafted tibias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tibias maintained for seven days in organ culture were achondroplastic if pretreated with <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> at seven or eight days of incubation but not at ten days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure of as little as 0.5 hour was sufficient to elicit <z:hpo ids='HP_0002983'>micromelia</z:hpo> when the tibias were grafted or organ cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">Thallium</z:chebi> therefore rapidly binds to skeletal tissues during a critical period of embryonic development but this critical period may be extended when tibias are removed from the embryo </plain></SENT>
