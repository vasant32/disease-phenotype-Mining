<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the underlying defect in seven cases with this group of conditions, we used the combined strategy of cartilage protein analysis and COL2A1 mutation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overmodified type II collagen and the presence of type I collagen was found in the cartilage matrix of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients were heterozygous for a nucleotide change that predicted a glycine substitution in the triple helical domain (G313S, G517V, G571A, G910C, G943S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases, analysis of cartilage type II collagen suggested incorporation of the abnormal alpha1(II) chain in the extracellular collagen trimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The G943S mutation has been reported previously in another unrelated patient with a strikingly similar phenotype, illustrating the possible specific effect of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The radiographically less severely affected patient was heterozygous for a 4 bp deletion in the splice donor site of intron 35, likely to result in aberrant splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case was shown to be heterozygous for a single nucleotide change predicted to result in a T1191N substitution in the carboxy-propeptide of the proalpha1(II) collagen chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Study of the clinical, radiographic, and morphological features of the seven cases supports evidence for a phenotypic continuum between achondrogenesis II-hypochondrogenesis and lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEDC</z:e> and suggests a relationship between the amount of type I collagen in the cartilage and the severity of the phenotype </plain></SENT>
