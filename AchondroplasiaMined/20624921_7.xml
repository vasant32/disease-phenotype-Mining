<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The G380R mutation in FGFR3 transmembrane domain is known as the genetic cause for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most common form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite many studies, there is no consensus about the exact mechanism underlying the pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To gain further understanding into the physical basis behind the disorder, here we measure the activation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and mutant FGFR3 in mammalian cells using Western blots, and we analyze the activation within the frame of a physical-chemical model describing dimerization, ligand binding, and phosphorylation probabilities within the dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data analysis presented here suggests that the mutation does not increase FGFR3 dimerization, as proposed previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, FGFR3 activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is increased due to increased probability for phosphorylation of the unliganded mutant dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding has implications for the design of targeted molecular treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
