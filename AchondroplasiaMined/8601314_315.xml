<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have identified a role for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) in this process by disrupting the murine Fgfr-3 gene to produce severe and progressive bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> with enhanced and prolonged endochondral bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This growth is accompanied by expansion of proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes within the cartilaginous growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, FGFR-3 appears to regulate endochondral ossification by an essentially negative mechanism, limiting rather than promoting osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In light of these mouse results, certain human disorders, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, can be interpreted as gain-of-function mutations that activate the fundamentally negative growth control exerted by the FGFR-3 kinase </plain></SENT>
