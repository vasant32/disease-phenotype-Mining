<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) cause the most common genetic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH), as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal lethal</z:hpo> forms, thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD) I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causative mutations induce graded levels of constitutive activation of the receptor that correspond to the severity of the disorder, resulting in premature entry into hypertrophic differentiation and reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in developing cartilage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although FGFR3 promotes growth in most tissues, it is a negative regulator of endochondral bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several signaling pathways have been implicated in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> including the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway and the JAK/STAT, the latter in the most severe phenotypes, however their functional relevance remains incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using PC12 cell lines stably expressing inducible mutant receptors containing the TDII mutation, K650E, sustained activation of ERK1/2 and activation of STAT1 and STAT3, but not STAT5, is observed in the absence of ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This activation leads to neurite outgrowth, a phenotypic readout of constitutive receptor activity, and sustained ERK1/2 activity is required for this ligand-independent differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional relevance of STAT activation induced by the mutant receptor, STATs were specifically downregulated using <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Silencing of STAT1 or 3 independently or in combination had no significant effect on ligand-independent neurite outgrowth, ERK1/2 activation or p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support a model in which sustained activation of ERK1/2 is a key regulator of the increased transition to hypertrophic differentiation of the growth plate, whereas activation of STATs 1 and 3 is not required </plain></SENT>
