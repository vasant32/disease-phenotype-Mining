<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 68 (85%) who were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, 35 (51.5%) were post infective, 14 (20.6%) were associated with lumbosacral <z:mp ids='MP_0009929'>myelomeningocele</z:mp>, 13(19.1%) were post haemorrhagic and the rest probably congenital or idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> comprised six children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002324'>hydranencephaly</z:hpo>, five with subdural effusion and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography of the head is thus a simple, quick, non-invasive, economical diagnostic tool in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> and to a limited sense as effective as CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its increased use in the investigation of infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is therefore recommended in developing countries with limited resources and without sophisticated imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
