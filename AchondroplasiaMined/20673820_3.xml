<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typical radiological features include shortening of the tubular bones and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, due to disruption of endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consequently, FGFR3 has been described as a negative regulator of bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studying a large cohort of ACH patients, a delay in bone age was observed shortly after birth (for boys p=2.6×10(-9) and for girls p=1.2×10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This delay was no longer apparent during adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to gain further insight into bone formation, bone development was studied in a murine model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> (Fgfr3(Y367C/+)) from birth to 6weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002750'>Delayed bone age</z:hpo> was also observed in Fgfr3(Y367C/+) mice at 1week of age followed by an accelerated secondary ossification center formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A low level of chondrocyte proliferation was observed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth plate at birth, which increased with bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the pathological condition, a significantly high level of proliferative cells was present at birth, but exhibited a transient decrease only to rise again subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological and in situ analyses suggested the altered endochondral ossification process may result from delayed chondrocyte differentiation, disruption of vascularization and osteoblast invasion of the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these data provide evidence that FGFR3 regulates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation during bone growth and suggest that constitutive activation of the receptor disrupts both processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the consequences of FGFR3 activation on the physiological process of bone development appear to be dependent on spatial and temporal occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these observations support the notion that FGFR3 has a dual effect, as both a negative and a positive regulator of the endochondral ossification process during post-natal bone development </plain></SENT>
