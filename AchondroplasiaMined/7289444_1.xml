<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the perinatal period boys grow faster than girls, presumably because of higher concentration of plasma <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the age of 6-7 years there is a modest midgrowth spurt, presumably caused by the increasing secretion of adrenal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> (adrenarche) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Just before puberty growth velocity reaches its lowest point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is followed by the pubertal growth spurt with its peak at a mean age of 12 years in girls and 14 years in boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This growth spurt is more marked in boys and is caused by the increasing secretion of gonadal steroids (gonadarche) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three or four years later growth ceases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Growth and bone maturation are closely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both the pubertal growth spurt and bone maturation girls are two years advanced compared to boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From height and bone age a quite accurate estimation of the timing of puberty and of adult height can be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Height and growth velocity are independent multifactorial variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of growth problems are caused by constitutional (familial) variants of height (familial short or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000098'>tall stature</z:hpo>) and of velocity of growth and maturation (familial acceleration or delay of growth and adolescence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The causes of growth disturbances of organic origin are chromosomal aberrations (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>), dysmorphology syndromes (e.g., Russell-Silver syndrome), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">endocrinopathies</z:e> (e.g., hypopituitary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo>), and bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
