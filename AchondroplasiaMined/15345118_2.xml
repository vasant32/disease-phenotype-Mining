<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas the diagnosis of ACH can be established on clinical and radiologic grounds alone in the majority of cases, HYCH is more difficult to confirm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> can be especially helpful for the purpose of prenatal diagnosis, in early childhood to differentiate definitively between the largely overlapping phenotypes, and in atypical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two most prevalent mutations for each syndrome cause substitution of a single respective nucleotide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These mutations can be identified by a variety of molecular methods, including PCR with restriction enzyme digestion or direct DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have developed a single-step, real-time PCR assay in which two detection probes are applied in combination with a single anchor probe at each mutation position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the two most prevalent mutations for each syndrome cause substitution of a single respective nucleotide, this approach guarantees optimal differentiation during probe dissociation analysis after amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This assay, which is performed on the LightCycler thermocycler, enables the rapid and reliable detection of the two most common FGFR3 mutations associated with ACH (1138G --&gt; A and 1138G --&gt; C; G380R) and HYCH (1620C --&gt; A and 1620 C --&gt; G; N540K) in a single test </plain></SENT>
