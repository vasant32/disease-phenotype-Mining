<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence, the authors conducted a retrospective study in a consecutive single-center series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> to determine the prevalence and imaging features of this entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also reviewed the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies obtained to establish diagnoses in 25 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and assessed at the Leiden University Medical Center after neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> developed were evaluated for the presence of a CHII lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imaging features of the lesion were described, and a literature search was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CHII lesion was demonstrated in 16 of 25 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (64%) in the absence of local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were located at the C-2 level and appeared to be confined to the gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CHII lesion was associated with local spinal cord thinning, most likely representing focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In their literature search the authors found no description of the CHII lesion in adults, although its presence has been mentioned as a peculiarity in the pediatric achondroplastic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and symptomatic neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, a CHII lesion was frequently depicted on imaging studies, but it remains a fully explored imaging phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Its cause and clinical relevance require investigation, as does its prevalence in the general achondroplastic population </plain></SENT>
