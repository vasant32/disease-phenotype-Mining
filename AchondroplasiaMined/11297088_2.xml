<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hypochondroplasia is characterised by phenotypic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differentiation from other conditions with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> is often difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of radiological interpretation in the diagnosis of hypochondroplasia and to evaluate the most typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were correlated with molecular findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 21 patients with suspected hypochondroplasia based on the radiological criteria most often reported in the literature on this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Height, sitting height and head circumference were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiographs of the lumbar spine, left leg, pelvis and left hand were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the N540K mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene was verified by restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> radiographs which enabled the selection of patients were reviewed a second time by two paediatric radiologists in a blinded examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their results were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both radiologists confirmed the diagnosis in 10 out of 21 patients, while in the other 52% of cases they excluded the disease, were uncertain or they did not agree on the final interpretation of the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The best agreement rate was obtained in the evaluation of the lumbar spine and the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The radiological features of the nine patients (43%) carrying the N540K substitution were not remarkably different from the ones reported in the patients without this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the crucial skeletal regions on which to focus the diagnosis of hypochondroplasia are the lumbar spine and legs, while the pelvis and hands seem to be less characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, accurate radiological and clinical evaluation is needed, especially in cases without a defined genetic defect </plain></SENT>
