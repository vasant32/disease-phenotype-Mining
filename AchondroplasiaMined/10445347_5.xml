<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> may have high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> due to stenosis of the cranio-cervical junction resulting in neurological disability and an increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001699'>sudden death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> we recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) after median nerve stimulation in 30 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> aged 13 months to 18 years (mean 6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the conventional technique of recording the cortical N20 and the central conduction time (CCT), we employed a noncephalic reference electrode recording the subcortical waveforms N13b and P13. generated near the cranio-cervical junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings were related to the clinical status and MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients had MRI evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> with indentation or narrowing of the upper cervical cord, and 13 showed signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelomalacia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivities of the SEPs were 0.89 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002341'>cervical cord compression</z:hpo>, 0.92 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelomalacia</z:e> and 1.0 for the clinically symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no false-positive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subcortical SEPs were more sensitive than the conventional recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the conventional SEPs were highly specific in the most severely affected patients; here the specificity was 1.0 for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelomalacia</z:e> and 0.96 for symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative SEPs improved after occipital decompression in two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The analysis of somatosensory evoked potentials, in particular of subcortical tracings, is useful in the detection of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002318'>cervical myelopathy</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
