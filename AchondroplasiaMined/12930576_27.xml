<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human male is characterized by extremely poor semen quality as reflected in the number, <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and motility of the spermatozoa and a high incidence of nuclear and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of these factors, defective sperm function is thought to be a major contributor to the aetiology of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo>, as well as childhood diseases including dominant genetic mutations such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with the origin of poor semen quality include: (i) a lack of selection pressure for high fecundity genes in developed countries, (ii) an evolutionary lineage associated with the deterioration of several male fertility genes in humans and their close ancestors, (iii) genetic factors including, but not limited to, Y-chromosome deletions (iv) paternal age and (v) environmental factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A model is proposed whereby factors such as ageing or environmental toxicants initiate DNA strand breakage in the spermatozoa of affected males, eventually leading to a mutation in the embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis stresses the importance of discovering the identity of those environmental factors that are capable of damaging DNA integrity in the male germ line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such information could make an important contribution to understanding of the origins of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003251'>male infertility</z:hpo> and a variety of pathological conditions that affect humans, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and dominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
