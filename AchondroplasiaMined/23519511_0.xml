<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) found at the p16.3 locus on chromosome 4 which results in severe inhibition of subchondral bone growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anatomic variations, including articular and periarticular deformities classically seen with this condition, amplify the complexity of fracture fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood volume loss, age-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002659'>bone fragility</z:hpo>, component selection and positioning pose serious orthopaedic challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological comorbidities pose additional high-risk perioperative considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite an estimated prevalence of 1:25 000 in the general population, there is little literature concerning the operative and postoperative treatment challenges faced by orthopaedic surgeons dealing with fracture management on a patient with this condition </plain></SENT>
