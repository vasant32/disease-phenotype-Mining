<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the frequency of clinical indicators for sleep-related respiratory disturbances (SRD) and the polysomnographical manifestations of these disorders in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> caused by FGFR3 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From January 1990 to January 2009, 24 patients (22 achondroplasia, 2 hypochondroplasia; 13 boys, 11 girls; age 8 days to 15 years, median age 3.0 years) were examined, including a semi-structured interview, a clinical examination, and a polysomnographic sleep recording (65 polysomnographic sleep recordings (PSG) in 24 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed PSG in a subgroup of five patients before and after adenoidectomy (AT) and/or tonsilectomy (TE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Daytime symptoms suggestive of SRD (daytime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, attention and concentration problems, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>) were found in 4/24 patients (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sleep-related symptoms (snoring, mouth breathing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo>, observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneas</z:hpo>, excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000805'>enuresis</z:hpo>, problems of initiating and maintaining sleep) were present in 18/24 patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the first PSG, 11/24 patients (45.8%) had undergone AT, 1/24 (4.2%) TE, 2/24 (8.3%) adenotonsilectomy (ATE), 3/24 (12.5%) liquor drainage, and 6/24 (25%) a craniocervical decompression operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination prior to PSG revealed hypertrophied tonsils in 11/24 patients (45.8%), disturbed nasal breathing in 8/24 patients (33.3), and <z:mp ids='MP_0008542'>enlarged cervical lymph nodes</z:mp> as a sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011110'>tonsillitis</z:hpo> in 5/24 patients (20.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PSG findings were abnormal in 19/24 patients (79.2%) with a nadir of oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) below 90% and/or a nadir of transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen below 45 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pathologic PSG findings were found in 10/24 patients (41.7%): <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>) was diagnosed in 8/24 patients (33.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome in 1/24 patients (4.2%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> in 1/24 patients (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the following therapeutic interventions were performed: AT in 1/24 patients (4.2%), TE in 2/24 (8.3%), ATE in 2/24 (8.3%), and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) and bilevel positive airway pressure therapy (bilevel positive airway pressure), respectively, in 3/24 patients(12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SRD, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, represent a complication of clinical and prognostic relevance in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We therefore think that not only those children with a history suggestive of SRD, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> achondroplastic children should be evaluated by PSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At least in a part of these patients, the pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> are connected with the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Achondroplastic children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>, who do not benefit from AT and/or TE, should be treated with NCPAP therapy </plain></SENT>
