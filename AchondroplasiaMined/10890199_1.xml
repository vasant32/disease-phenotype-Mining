<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the FGFR3 gene in 26 Japanese patients with ACH and 14 with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNAs of the patients were isolated from whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the ACH patients, a 164-bp fragment of the FGFR3 gene that spans the entire transmembrane domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the PCR products were analyzed by direct sequencing of the PCR products and by digestion of the PCR products with restriction enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi> patients, a 206-bp fragment of the FGFR3 gene which encodes a part of the TK1 domain was amplified, and the PCR products were directly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous G380R mutations were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 26 ACH patients, whereas the heterozygous N540K mutations were identified in 8 out of 14 HCH patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with previous reports from abroad </plain></SENT>
