<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cases, showing the characteristic X-ray picture of the disease, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathologically, an abnormality in the endochondral ossification process was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In sections from tubular bones the growth zone was found to be irregular with deficient chondrocyte maturation, absence of orderly chondrocyte columns, and the development of coarse bone trabeculae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, prominent subperiostal bone formation could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A constant finding was also a fibrous band, continuous with the periosteum/perichondrium, and extending into the growth zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From this fibrous tissue membranous bone formation, directed towards the metaphysis and appearing to add to bone length, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems as if direct bone formation predominates in thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
