<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, the most prevalent form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the discovery of the mutations and gene in 1994, commercial testing has been available for use in prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to determine the awareness of, interest in and use of prenatal genetic testing for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surveys were collected from both individuals affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (n = 189) and their average statured relatives (n = 136) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of participants were aware of the prenatal genetic testing at the time they were surveyed, but less than 10% had actually used the testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affected individuals were much more interested in using the testing if they became pregnant (62%) than were their relatives (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The groups were remarkably similar in their interest in using the testing to identify the lethal, homozygous form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and in their unwillingness to consider termination of pregnancies based on a diagnosis of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> or average stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Affected status and perception of the condition were correlated with the importance placed on knowing the prenatal diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and average stature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Views on abortion were highly correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aspects of interest in prenatal diagnosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results elucidate the role of selected attitudes and beliefs that contribute to reproductive decision making about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the findings provide insights into education and counseling issues for families and health care practitioners </plain></SENT>
