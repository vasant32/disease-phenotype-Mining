<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that defective lysosomal degradation of activated receptor contributes to the gain-of-function of the mutant FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now provide evidence that this disturbance is mediated by the receptor's kinase activity and involves constitutive induction and activation of Spry2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that activated Spry2 may interfere with c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-mediated ubiquitination of FGFR3 by sequestering c-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
