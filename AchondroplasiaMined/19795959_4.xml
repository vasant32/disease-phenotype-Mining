<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is the most common form of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limbed dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pediatric neurosurgeon is frequently required to treat children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, cervicomedullary compression (CMD), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal canal stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the authors have reviewed the experience of neurosurgery in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> at The Hospital for Sick Children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical records and neurosurgery database at The Hospital for Sick Children were searched to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> who underwent at least 1 neurosurgical procedure between 1956 and the present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> underwent 85 surgical procedures: 52 for CSF diversion in 12 patients, 20 for CMD in 18 patients, 8 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal disorders</z:e> in 4 patients, and 5 for miscellaneous purposes in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CSF shunts were placed almost exclusively before 1990 and were associated with a significant number of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing CMD did very well, with only 1 patient failing to improve clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a historical perspective on the evolution of treatment of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of CSF diversion procedures, formerly fraught with complications, is now rare following the realization of the natural history of CSF space enlargement in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cervicomedullary compression is more commonly recognized due to better imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>Central apnea</z:hpo> is now better detected by routine sleep studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spine surgery, although rare, requires evaluation of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> and instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These patients are best evaluated by a multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>
