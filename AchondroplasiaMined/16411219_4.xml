<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3) gene in this patient showed the common p.G380R mutation and a second novel p.L377R mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An allele-specific PCR demonstrated that these mutations were on the same allele (cis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both mutations were not present in the parents and appear to have occurred de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature on an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patient with two FGFR3 mutations on the same allele </plain></SENT>
