<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study compares the relative effects of advancing male age on multiple genomic defects in human sperm [DNA fragmentation index (DFI), chromatin integrity, gene mutations, and numerical chromosomal abnormalities], characterizes the relationships among these defects and with semen quality, and estimates the incidence of susceptible individuals for a well characterized nonclinical nonsmoking group of 97 men (22-80 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjusting for confounders, we found major associations between age and the frequencies of sperm with DFI and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) mutations associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.01) with no evidence for age thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, we found no associations between age and the frequencies of sperm with immature chromatin, <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidies</z:mp>/diploidies, FGFR2 mutations (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>), or sex ratio in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were also no consistent correlations among genomic and semen-quality endpoints, except between DFI and sperm motility (r = -0.65, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest there are multiple spermatogenic targets for genomically defective sperm with substantially variable susceptibilities to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings predict that as healthy males age, they have decreased pregnancy success with trends beginning in their early reproductive years, increased risk for producing offspring with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> mutations, and risk of fathering offspring with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> that may vary across cohorts, but with no increased risk for fathering aneuploid offspring (Down, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022735" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Klinefelter</z:e>, Turner, triple X, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">XYY syndromes</z:e>) or triploid embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that the burden of genomic damage in sperm cannot be inferred from semen quality, and that a small fraction of men are at increased risk for transmitting multiple genetic and chromosomal defects </plain></SENT>
