<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In more than 98% of cases, the disease is associated with a G to A or G to C substitution at nucleotide position 1138 (p.G380R) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a sensitive single tube tetra-primer PCR assay to detect both the c.1138G&gt;A and c.1138G&gt;C mutations and can successfully distinguish DNA samples that are homozygous and heterozygous for the c.1138G&gt;A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Titration studies showed that the assay could reliably detect one copy of the mutant allele in a mix of 100 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assay has been tested in 50 healthy controls, 3 known patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and 5 amniotic fluids suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and for whom we had previously determined the genotypes for the c.1138G&gt;A mutation by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have observed complete concordance between methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our tetra-primer PCR assay is sensitive, low-cost, and easy to use method for FGFR3 p.G380R genotyping, which could be used even in "low-tech" laboratories </plain></SENT>
