<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This substitution was suggested to enhance mutant receptor dimerization, leading to constitutive, ligand-independent activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that dimerization and activation of the G380R mutant receptor are predominantly ligand dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, using both transient and stable transfections, we found significant overexpression only of the mutant receptor protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolic pulse-chase experiments, cell surface labeling, and kinetics of uptake of radiolabeled ligand demonstrated a selective delay in the down-regulation of the mutant receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this receptor was now resistant to ligand-mediated internalization, even at saturating ligand concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, transgenic mice expressing the human G380R mutant receptor under the mouse receptor transcriptional control demonstrated a markedly expanded area of FGFR3 immunoreactivity within their epiphyseal growth plates, compatible with an in vivo defect in receptor down-regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> mutation G380R uncouples ligand-mediated receptor activation from down-regulation at a site where the levels and kinetics of FGFR3 signals are crucial for chondrocyte maturation and bone formation </plain></SENT>
