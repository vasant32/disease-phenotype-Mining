<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A client with hypochondroplasia <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> and a medical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> had found that her ability to walk had decreased over the past 7 years from easily walking 6 miles (10 K) to now needing to rest every half block (171 ft/52 m) due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003646'>muscle fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> is consistent with nerve impingement due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo>, which would not be improved by massage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, during a preliminary assessment, it was found that both lower legs had severe fascial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e>, possibly compressing lower leg blood vessels and nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was hoped that by using myofascial massage techniques to relieve the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e>, her mobility would improve over the course of 8 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Myofascial massage techniques showed positive results in reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e>, improving circulation, and increasing the distance the client could walk before resting to 2 blocks (686 ft/209 m) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Working with this client showed that Licensed Massage Practitioners (LMPs) can easily accommodate clients of very short height </plain></SENT>
