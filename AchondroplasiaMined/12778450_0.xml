<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The high-frequency mutation region G380R of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene was amplified by nested-PCR with single lymphocyte and single blastomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The products of PCR were digested by restriction enzyme Bfm I, then the digested products were detected by 10% polyacrylamida gel electrophoresis(PAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The amplification success rate, allele dropout rate and correct diagnosis rate of single lymphocyte's PCR were 90.4%, 8.2% and 91.8%,respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplification success rate of single blastomere was 75.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of ACH by single cell nested-PCR is comparatively stable and reliable </plain></SENT>
