<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> show <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical therapy has been attempted to correct bone deformities, but therapy for improving their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> has been rarely attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a clinical trial of growth hormone (GH) therapy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH), hypochondroplasia (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002655'>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> congenita (SED), or Schmid type <z:hpo ids='HP_0100255'>metaphyseal dysplasia</z:hpo> (MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study examined the efficacy of GH therapy on height increase and change of height SD score over a 1-year period in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> and showed a short-term efficacy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ACH, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24536">HCH</z:chebi>, and MD, GH had a significant effect on height gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and SED showed no height gain efficacy; in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>, height SD score was worse after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe adverse events were not observed except in one SED case, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> worsened and height did not increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, GH therapy is moderately effective for height gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is ineffective in cases with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0008443'>spinal deformities</z:hpo>, however; although bone growth was promoted, the ligaments and matrix were too weak to support muscle tonus and the effects of gravity, resulting in worsened <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003307'>lordosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results clarify why GH therapy is ineffective for height gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic genes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> have recently been detected and consequently changes in bone formation have been investigated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful consideration of indications for therapy and cautious observation during therapy are crucial when attempting to treat advanced bone deformities </plain></SENT>
