<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of the FGFR3 mutants on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were analyzed in a chondrogenic cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ACH chondrocytes exhibited marked apoptotic with downregulation of PTHrP expression </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> (ACH), the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limb dwarfism</z:hpo>, and its related disorders are caused by constitutively activated point-mutated FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have provided a large body of evidence on chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the possible effects of the FGFR3 mutants on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mutant FGFR3 genes causing ACH and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (TD), which is a more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal lethal</z:hpo> form, were introduced into a chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was estimated by TUNEL assay, DNA laddering, and fluorescent measurement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of parathyroid hormone-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (PTHrP) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related genes were analyzed by Northern blot or immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The introduction of these mutated FGFR3s into ATDC5 cells downregulated PTHrP expression and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> with reduction of Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, replacement of PTHrP prevented the apoptotic changes and reduction of Bcl-2 expression in ATDC5 cells expressing the ACH mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In parallel with the severity of disease and the activity of FGFR3, ATDC5 cells expressing TD-mutant FGFR3 showed less expression of PTHrP and Bcl-2 and induced more remarkable apoptotic changes compared with ACH-mutant expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited apoptotic changes, suggesting that the mutant FGFR3 caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, at least in part, through reduction of Bcl-2 expression, which seems to be downstream of PTHrP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that excessive activation of signaling cascades mediated by the FGFR3 mutants inhibits the expression of PTHrP and Bcl-2, resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of chondrocytes, possibly leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limb dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rescue of these cells by PTHrP replacement implies a potential therapy for this disorder </plain></SENT>
