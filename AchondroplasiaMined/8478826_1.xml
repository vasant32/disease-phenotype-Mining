<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight segments were lengthened by callotasis, 24 in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attempted lengthening with chondrodiatasis was performed in 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leg length discrepancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With callotasis, planned lengthening was achieved in 43/48 (90%) of segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a small number of significant complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angulation or buckling of the new bone was the commonest major complication, and was seen in 10% of segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pin tract <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the predominant minor complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Premature union was noted commonly in the femurs of achondroplastics, but could usually be overcome with manipulation under anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We confirm that callotasis achieves its objectives with fewer complications and operations than the commonly used Wagner method which it should supersede </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, we had major complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with chondrodiatasis and have abandoned this method </plain></SENT>
