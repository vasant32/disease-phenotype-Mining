<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deviation at the knee from the hip ankle line (conventional) and hip foot line (centre of hip to centre of heel) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison was made between single leg stance and two leg stance for tibiocalcaneal angle, mechanical axis angle, knee and ankle joint line convergence angle, conventional mechanical axis deviation (MADC) and ground mechanical axis deviation (MADG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition comparisons were also made among three groups formed depending on the tibiocalcaneal angle and MADC-MADG difference for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the above measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical axis deviation (calculated using the two methods) varied with the talocalcaneal angle and single leg stance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with a fixed subtalar varus and with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002970'>genu varum</z:hpo>, where the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compensatory subtalar eversion could not compensate showed that conventional mechanical axis deviation was significantly higher by 3.4+/-2.4 mm and ground mechanical axis deviation degrees was significantly higher by 3.8+/-3.2 mm in single leg stance when compared to two leg stance (p&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
