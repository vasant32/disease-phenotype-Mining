<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a Japanese girl (follow-up, 3-10 years of age) whose epi-metaphyseal involvement of long bones was minimal and whose height was +2 S.D. of standard for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> in spite of the typical changes of the vertebral bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She might not have been diagnosed only as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> but also as MED, Fairbank type, after disappearance of the typical vertebral body changes because of the apparent lack of stubby fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the overlap of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> and MED has recently been discussed from the viewpoint of molecular biology, study of the spectrum of clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> is important </plain></SENT>
