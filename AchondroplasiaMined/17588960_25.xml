<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most COMP mutations identified to date cluster in the TSP3 repeat region of COMP and the mutant protein is retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) of chondrocytes and may result in increased cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the pathomolecular mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> resulting from C-terminal domain COMP mutations remain largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study describes the generation and analysis of a murine model of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> resulting from a p.Thr583Met mutation in the C-terminal globular domain (CTD) of COMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutant animals are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at birth, but grow slower than their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates and by 9 weeks of age they have mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0008873'>short-limb dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by 16 months of age mutant animals exhibit severe degeneration of articular cartilage, which is consistent with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the growth plates of mutant mice the chondrocyte columns are sparser and poorly organized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutant COMP is secreted into the extracellular matrix, but its localization is disrupted along with the distribution of several COMP-binding proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although mutant COMP is not retained within the rER there is an unfolded protein/cell stress response and chondrocyte proliferation is significantly reduced, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is both increased and spatially dysregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data suggests a mutation in the CTD of COMP exerts a dominant-negative effect on both intra- and extracellular processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This ultimately affects the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes, eventually leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> and reduced long bone growth </plain></SENT>
