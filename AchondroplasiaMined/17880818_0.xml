<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who are treated for increasing their height decided to have humeral lengthening and the indication for treatment is not only for cosmetic, psychological aspects but also limitation of upper limb function like self-services and personal hygiene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 5 patients were evaluated (4 girls and 1 boy) at age of 14 to 18 years (mean 15.7) in whom 10 humeral lengthening were do-ne using monolateral external fixator "Pumed" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients have lower limb lengthening with the Ilizarov method 4-5 years before humeral lengthening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Observation time was 6 to 34 months (mean 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the Pumed external fixator was fixed to humerus by 4 Schanz screws, open humeral distraction osteotomy was done below the insertion of deltoid muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case 15 degrees anteflexion correction was done intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distraction began at 5-6th day postoperatively with rate of 1 mm/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of hypertrophic bone regenerate the distraction rate was often increased up to 1.5 mm/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 8 to 9 cm lengthening was achieved (mean 8.5) which represents more than 50% of the primary segmental length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average time of fixator application was 7 months and the lengthening index ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 months/cm (average 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No shoulder and elbow joint range of motion deterioration was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the follow-up transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306600" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radial nerve palsy</z:e> was observed in one case after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> limb axis correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Humerus lengthening, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients with the use of monolateral external fixator is an effective and reliable method of treatment, with relatively low lengthening index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Monolateral External Fixator are well tolerated by patients </plain></SENT>
