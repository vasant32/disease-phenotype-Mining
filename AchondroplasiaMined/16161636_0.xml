<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In more than 97% of cases, it is caused by a recurrent point mutation, a G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1138 (G1138A) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although this is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> condition, more than 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mutations occur sporadically making this one of the most mutagenic sites in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the high spontaneous G1138A mutation rate are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This investigation was performed by developing a simple and rapid semi-quantitative allele specific PCR based assay capable of reliably detecting more than 25 mutant G1138A copies in a pool of 300 000 <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this assay, the G1138A mutation frequency was measured in cell lines deficient in mismatch repair (LoVo, SW48) and comparing it with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were found in the frequency of this point mutation between the mismatch repair deficient and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
