<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> is characterized by delays in the development of communication and motor skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While previously reported developmental profiles exist across gross motor, fine motor, feeding, and communication skills, there has been no prospective study of development across multiple areas simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: This Australasian population-based study utilized a prospective questionnaire to quantify developmental data for skills in children born from 2000 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight families from Australia and New Zealand were asked to report every 3 months on their child's attainment of 41 milestones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results include reference to previously available prospective information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Information from questionnaires was used to develop an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>-specific developmental recording form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th centiles were plotted to offer clear guidelines for development across gross motor, fine motor, feeding, and communication skills in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATIONS: Consistent with results from previous research, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> are delayed in development of gross motor and ambulatory skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> demonstrate a number of unique movement strategies that appear compensatory for the biomechanical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While delays were seen in development of later communication items, there were fewer delays seen across development of early communication, fine motor, and feeding skills </plain></SENT>
