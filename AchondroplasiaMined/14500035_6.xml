<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">Inosine</z:chebi>-substituted 12-mer capture probes related to the homozygous or heterozygous alleles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> G380R mutation were adsorbed onto carbon paste electrode (CPE) surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> signal was obtained from the capture probes, since the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> bases were electroinactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, these probes were hybridized with the denatured PCR samples on the CPE surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hybridization between the probe and target sequences was determined by using the oxidation signal of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> in connection with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxidation signal of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> was observed as a result of the specific hybridization between the probe and PCR sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in the peak height of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> signal provided the information whether the PCR sample contained heterozygous allele or homozygous allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numerous factors affecting the hybridization and nonspecific binding events were optimized to detect down to 41.24 fmol/ml target DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The electrochemical detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> G380R mutation from PCR samples greatly shortened and simplified the diagnosis for the homozygous mutant type, which is lethal for the newborn </plain></SENT>
