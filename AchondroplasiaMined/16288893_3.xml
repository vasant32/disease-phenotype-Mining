<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the cortical reorganization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplastic dwarfs</z:e> submitted to progressive elongation (PE) of lower limbs through the Ilizarov technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paradigm is ideal for studying cortical plasticity because it avoids the perturbation connected with deafferentation and re-afferentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked-potentials (SEP) and fMRI studies were performed before and after PE during foot and knee stimulation, above and below the surgical fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A body schema test was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following PE, cortical modifications were observed in the primary somatosensory cortex for foot stimulation and in higher order somatosensory cortices for foot and knee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The former modifications tended to decrease 6 months after the elongation ending, whereas the latter tended to persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results are interpreted in terms of cortical adaptation mediated by temporary disorganization </plain></SENT>
