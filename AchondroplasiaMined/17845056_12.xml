<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of pathogenesis, as determined by mutation-induced changes in receptor structure, interactions, and function, is elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we study three pathogenic Cys mutations, associated with either thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, in the TM domain of fibroblast growth factor receptors 3 (FGFR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We characterize the dimerization propensities of the mutant TM domains in detergents and in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayers, in the presence and absence of reducing agents, and compare them to previous measurements of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We find that the Cys mutations increase the propensity for dimerization in detergent, with the Cys370 mutant exhibiting the highest propensity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond formation, the Cys371 mutant having an intermediate propensity, and Cys375 the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds readily form in detergents, with efficiency that correlates with the severity of the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayers, however, the Cys370 mutant, which dimerizes strongly in detergent, behaves as the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, suggesting that Cys370-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds do not form between the isolated TM domains in bilayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the nature of the hydrophobic environment plays an important role in defining the structure and flexibility of transmembrane dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results and previous findings from cellular studies lead us to propose a conformational flexibility mechanism of receptor stabilization as a basis for disregulated FGFR3 signaling in thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
