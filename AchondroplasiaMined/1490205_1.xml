<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leg length discrepancies</z:e>, five <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasias</z:e>, four deformed feet, five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>joint contractures</z:hpo>, one rotational deformity of tibia, and in three the apparatus was used as an external fixator after corrective osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lengthening was accomplished in 15 of the 16 procedures (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Average increase in femur length was 10 cm (32%), in tibial length 7.5 cm (30%), in humerus 11 cm (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bony union was achieved in two out of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0005864'>pseudoarthroses</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four deformed feet were fully corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>Joint contractures</z:hpo> were corrected in four out of five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The complication rate is as high as in other methods but with the Ilizarov apparatus, longer segments of bone were lengthened and more complex deformities were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications lessened as experience was gained </plain></SENT>
