<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of new imaging techniques in the prenatal diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May and October 2003, a prospective study was conducted in a single referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and three-dimensional helical computer tomography (3D-HCT) were performed after two-dimensional ultrasound (2D-US) in six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic accuracy and detailed findings with each of the three techniques were compared with postnatal radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268358" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta type II</z:e> and one case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> punctata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Termination of pregnancy was performed in five cases and one fetus with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268358" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta type II</z:e> was delivered at term by Cesarean section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2D-US made the correct diagnosis in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3D-US and 3D-HCT achieved an accurate diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3D-HCT and 3D-US identified significantly more abnormalities than did 2D-US (3D-HCT: 94.3% (33/35); 3D-US: 77.1% (27/35); 2D-US: 51.4% (18/35); P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The advantage of 3D-HCT over 3D-US was the possibility of imaging the entire fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 3D-US and 3D-HCT seem to be useful complementary methods to 2D-US, and may improve accuracy of the prenatal diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These new imaging technologies may have a role in the prenatal multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
