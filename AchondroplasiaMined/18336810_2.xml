<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have tested the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18405">pyridoxal-5'-phosphate</z:chebi>-6-azophenyl-2', 4'-disulfonate (PPADS) to decrease the overactivation and signalling of FGF receptor type 3 in achondroplasic chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PPADS reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF receptor type 3 triggered by fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) (50% reduction), as well as the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of this inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 activity the loss of extracellular matrix was also reversed by PPADS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The action of PPADS seems to be due to a mechanism independent of P2 receptor antagonism </plain></SENT>
