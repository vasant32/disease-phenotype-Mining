<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Patients (7 boys and 10 girls; mean age, 11.8 +/- 3.3 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> performed a maximal treadmill exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anthropometric variables and muscle strength were measured and compared with the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of everyday physical activity was measured by using a diary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional ability was measured by using the Activity Scale for Kids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The exercise capacity of the children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was significantly reduced compared with reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anthropometrical measurements differed significantly from reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a decrease in muscle strength in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> muscle groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a reduced physical activity level and impairments in functional ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and muscle strength in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> was reduced compared with reference values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> have a unique response to exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should take these characteristic differences into account when the exercise capacity of subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is being tested </plain></SENT>
