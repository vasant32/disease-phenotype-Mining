<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathology of four types of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasias</z:mp>, viz., type II achondrogenesis, thanatophoric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saldino-Noonan syndrome</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> punctata were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each of these disorders, cells with features similar to the chief and dark chondrocytes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hyaline cartilage were seen to be altered in different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a total absence of chief cells in type II achondrogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the chondrocytes present were of one variety at different states of maturation, with the fully matured cell having features of dark chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of chief cells was associated with marked diminution of interlacunar matrix and failure of growth plate development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chief chondrocytes in thanatophoric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> appeared diminished in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were probably abnormal functionally as evident by their lack of cytoplasmic vacuolation and the formation of thick, occasionally branched collagen in the matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The growth plate was stunted and poorly developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Striking changes involving the dark cells were noted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saldino-Noonan syndrome</z:e>, where unusually elongated dark cells were found in groups within abnormal cystic spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The chief cells were large and contained abnormal cytoplasmic filaments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no formation of a growth plate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodysplasia</z:mp> punctata, the chief cells were enlarged and abnormally vacuolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The matrix showed excessive aggregates of coarse granular material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were focal accumulations of highly abnormal chief and dark cells with abnormal matrix which contained increased amount of keratan <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> and culminated in spotty calcification </plain></SENT>
