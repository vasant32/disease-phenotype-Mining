<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed peripheral nerve function during and after lower-limb lengthening by callotasis in 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, using motor conduction studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> of varying aetiology showed unilateral and one showed bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of foot dorsiflexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both clinical and electrophysiological abnormalities consistent with involvement of the peroneal nerve were observed early after starting tibial callotasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was some progressive electrophysiological improvement despite continued bone distraction, but two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner's syndrome</z:e> had incomplete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greater percentage increase in tibial length did not correspond to a higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270810" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peroneal nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The function of the posterior leg muscles and the conduction velocity of the posterior tibial nerve were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> throughout the monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The F-wave response showed a longer latency at the end of the bone distraction than in basal conditions; this is probably related to the slowing of conduction throughout the entire length of the nerve </plain></SENT>
