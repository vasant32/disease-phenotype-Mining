<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate lung function and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An interview, clinical examination, lung function tests with blood gases, and a polygraphic sleep study were obtained as part of routine annual evaluation in consecutive children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included 30 children (median age 3.0 years, range: 0.4-17.1) over a period of 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Habitual snoring and witnessed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apneas</z:hpo> were observed in 77% and 33% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the sleep study, 10/29 (34%) patients had undergone upper airway surgery and 5/29 (17%) craniocervical decompression operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood gases were abnormal in two (7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sleep findings were abnormal in 28/30 (93%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven (37%) patients had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> index≥1 event/hr and 26 (87%) had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>-<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index≥5 events/hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ≥3% desaturation index was &gt;5/hr in 22 (73%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (53%) patients had a minimal pulse oximetry&lt;90% but only two (7%) patients had a maximal transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure&gt;50 mmHg during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the following therapeutic interventions were performed: upper airway surgery in four patients and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in five other patients, resulting in an improvement in sleep studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Systematic sleep studies are recommended in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> because of the high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Upper airway surgery and NPPV are effective treatments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037315" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep-disordered breathing</z:e> </plain></SENT>
