<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Since the discovery of the gene that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, population-wide prenatal screening for this condition has become a possibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to assess attitudes toward screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and correlation with quality of life in a population of individuals affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surveys were collected from 189 individuals affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and 136 average-statured first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: While 87% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> respondents would support the use of prenatal screening by affected parents at risk of having a fetus with the homozygous, lethal form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, 29% would support general population prenatal screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Attitudes supporting general population screening were more likely to be held by those people with less education, who were affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, who supported abortion, and who believed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is a serious condition without any accompanying advantages (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those respondents who felt positively toward offering the prenatal test for individuals at risk for homozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were more likely to have lower mean quality of life scores and to support abortion in general (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that opinions about prenatal screening are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> within this study population and are related to individuals' experiences and perceptions of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Future research is needed to assess attitudes toward population screening and quality of life in communities of individuals affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e>, both to support policy decisions and to inform the education and counseling provided in the prenatal setting </plain></SENT>
