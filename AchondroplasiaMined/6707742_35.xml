<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From a previous study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> as well as from the observation of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e>, the authors have concluded that an increased superior sagittal sinus venous pressure (SSVP) could be the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, other workers have demonstrated that an increased SSVP could be the consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors undertook a study to determine if there was a physiological test that could distinguish between rare instances of increased SSVP caused by structural and irreversible narrowing of the sinus and those caused by increased ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 20 hydrocephalic infants and children, pressure was simultaneously measured in the lateral ventricle, the superior sagittal sinus, and the jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stable baseline pressures were recorded, as well as the variations observed after the withdrawal of an amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sufficient to lower ICP to zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar recordings were taken after reinjection of an equal quantity of CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients, SSVP was increased, but not as much as the ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> without any associated cranial malformation, and therefore without any likely anatomical interruption of the sinus, CSF withdrawal induced a simultaneous decrease of ICP and SSVP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, whereas ICP could be lowered to zero, SSVP never fell below the jugular venous pressure, which remained stable (around 5 mm Hg) throughout the recording session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were different when sinography demonstrated an anatomical interruption of the sinus, as in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniostenosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these cases, although ICP was normally lowered by CSF withdrawal, SSVP remained nearly unchanged, usually greater than the jugular venous pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that SSVP recording during ICP variations induced by CSF withdrawal permits differentiation between a reversible collapse of the sigmoid sinus due to increased ICP and a fixed obstructive lesion of the sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based upon this test and the results of sinography, the authors inserted a venous bypass between the lateral sinus and a jugular vein in three patients </plain></SENT>
