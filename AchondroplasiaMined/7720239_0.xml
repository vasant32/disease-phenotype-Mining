<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The causes for low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (reference range 30-115 U/L) in a large Veterans Medical Center were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 69,864 ALP determinations made over a 4-year period, 130 were low (&lt; 30 U/L, 0.19%), representing 88 individual patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 83 (primarily men, 96%) patients' charts were reviewed and classified into two groups, those with and those without conditions previously reported to be associated with decreased serum ALP activity: 47% had conditions associated with low ALP activity, the most frequent being cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (26.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> (12.0%), <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> deficiency (4.8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (2.4%), and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (1.2%); 53% of patients did not have clinical conditions previously associated with low ALP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No case of clinically apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020630" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypophosphatasia</z:e>, for which low ALP activity is the defining characteristic, was found in this population of veterans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A low serum ALP may be of significance in other patient populations such as children, where it is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010308" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">cretinism</z:e>, or in postmenopausal women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the predominantly adult male population in this study, low ALP activity was rare; it was seen most frequently in cardiac surgery patients postoperatively, a clinical condition heretofore not commonly associated with low serum ALP activity </plain></SENT>
