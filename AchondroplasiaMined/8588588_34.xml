<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The degree of paternal age effect on the origin of these dominant mutations differed among the three conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean paternal age was highly elevated in AC, 36.30 +/- 6.74 years in the IPIMC, and 37.19 +/- 10.53 years in the ECLAMC; less consistently elevated in TD, 33.60 +/- 7.08 years in the IPIMC, and 36.41 +/- 9.38 years in the ECLAMC; and only slightly elevated in OI in the ECLAMC, 31.15 +/- 9.25 years, but not in the IPIMC, 32.26 +/- 6.07 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased maternal age or birth order in these conditions disappeared when corrected for paternal age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of AC and TD cases, and only 30% of OI cases, were born to fathers above age 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For AC and TD, the increase in relative incidence with paternal age fitted an exponential curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The variability of paternal age effect in these new mutations could be due, among other reasons, to the high proportion of germ-line mosaicism in OI parents, or to the localization of the AC gene, mapped to the 4p16.3 region, in the neighborhood of an unstable DNA area </plain></SENT>
