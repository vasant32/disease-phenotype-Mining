<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied two children with combined genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both had Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD); one also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and the other had hypochondroplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>severe short stature</z:hpo> and evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008905'>rhizomelia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003027'>mesomelia</z:hpo> as well as other phenotypic features of their individual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> was due to the G380R FGF3R mutation and hypochondroplasia to a N540K mutation in the same gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with hypochondroplasia had a heterozygous SHOX deletion; no SHOX mutation was identified in the child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes of combined LWD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> or hypochondroplasia appeared to be less than additive, suggesting that SHOX and FGFR3 act on overlapping pathways of bone growth and development </plain></SENT>
