<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic sections of large pieces of tissue obtained from both surgical and postmortem specimens of <z:mp ids='MP_0010079'>osteochondromas</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">enchondromas</z:e> were analyzed to elucidate the pathogenesis of these two lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0010079'>osteochondroma</z:mp> is derived from aberrant cartilaginous epiphyseal growth plate tissue, which proliferates autonomously and separates from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth plate near its edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As growth progresses, the aberrant tissue remains in a subperiosteal location, where it may either disappear through remodeling or proliferate as an early <z:mp ids='MP_0010079'>osteochondroma</z:mp> perpendicular to the orientation of the growth plate from which it was derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">enchondroma</z:e> also is derived from the actively proliferating cartilaginous tissue of growth plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For unknown reasons certain groups of chondrocytes do not proceed to undergo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, a column of uncalcified cartilage extends from the underside of the growth plate into the region in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cartilaginous tissue has been remodeled into primary bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bridge to the plate may either remain intact or become interrupted by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An isolated group of chondrocytes may (1) be walled off from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue by lamellar bone; (2) undergo calcification and secondary osseous remodeling, either in part or in total; or (3) proliferate as an intraosseous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_391'>chondroma</z:mpath> (benign <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">enchondroma</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A similar but not identical process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">enchondroma</z:e> formation may occur in fibrous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of bone, systemic growth plate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteogenesis imperfecta</z:e> </plain></SENT>
