<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the nature of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> defect, we determined the amount of the individual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18085">glycosaminoglycans</z:chebi> present in iliac-crest cartilage of three patients and extracted the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> monomers from one of the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sections of iliac-crest cartilage and proximal fibular growth plates were examined by electron microscopy and also stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin, safranin O-fast green, and alcian blue in the presence of increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="6636">magnesium chloride</z:chebi> (zero to one molar) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chondrocytes of the iliac crest and fibular physes were arranged in clusters more than in columns and contained characteristic endoplasmic reticulum inclusions, which were particularly large in the hypertrophic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cartilage stained very poorly with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and with safranin O-fast green </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The alcian-blue stain was abolished from perilacunar areas and from longitudinal septa by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="6636">magnesium chloride</z:chebi> concentrations that were lower than those required by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> of iliac-crest cartilage were found to be significantly enriched in keratan <z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> and had a below-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ratio of chondroitin-4-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi> to chondroitin-6-<z:chebi fb="100" ids="16189">sulphate</z:chebi>, although the amount of the two isomeric <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulphates</z:chebi> combined was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
