<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Table 1 and Figure 4 are presented to facilitate the comparison between the many different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008845'>mesomelic dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differential diagnosis between these types is not difficult because of the specific bone changes and extraskeletal malformations present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As in many hereditary syndromes, however, there may be wide clinical variability within a single entity, and meticulous clinical and radiologic examination must be done to arrive at the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Certain other forms of <z:mp ids='MP_0002657'>chondrodystrophies</z:mp>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, hypochondroplasia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> and distrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo>, can be easily differentiated from the mesomelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> by their clinical features and skeletal radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nothing is known about the pathogenesis of the various forms of mesomelic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is no available specific treatment, although corrective surgery has benefited selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnosis is, however, important both for prognostication and accurate genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
