<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These abnormal phenotypes are controlled by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> gene (cn) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, linkage analysis using 115 affected mice of F2 progeny mapped the cn locus on an approximately 0.8-cM region of chromosome 4, and natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> receptor 2 (Npr2) gene was identified as the most potent candidate for the cn mutant in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes a receptor for C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CNP) that positively regulates longitudinal bone growth by producing cGMP in response to CNP binding to the extracellular domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses of the Npr2 gene in cn/cn mice revealed a T to G transversion leading to the amino acid substitution of highly conserved Leu with Arg in the guanylyl cyclase domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cultured chondrocytes of cn/cn mice, stimulus with CNP did not significantly increase intracellular cGMP concentration, whereas it increased in +/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the mutant Npr2 gene into COS-7 cells also showed similar results, indicating that the missense mutation of the Npr2 gene in cn/cn mice resulted in disruption of the guanylyl cyclase activity of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore concluded that the dwarf phenotype of cn/cn mouse is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the Npr2 gene, and cn/cn mouse will be a useful model to further study the molecular mechanism regulating endochondral ossification by CNP/natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> receptor B signal </plain></SENT>
