<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors that have been shown to influence GH secretion include age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, sleep state, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> (OSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed GH levels in a group of subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, during overnight polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> were studied at 11.3 y of age (median 6.7, range 1.8-30.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of GH were measured using time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (DELFIA, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and analyzed by a deconvolution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five subjects were restudied after treatment for OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secretion rates of GH were greater in slow wave (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep than in stage one and two (SI-II = light non-REM) sleep (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total overnight GH secretion decreased with increasing age (r2 = 0.22 p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither the frequency of arousals, frequency of sleep state transitions nor the severity of OSA correlated with measures of GH secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Levels of IGF-I correlated independently with age, body weight (percent ideal), and GH secretion rate (r2 = 0.76, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a group of five subjects treated for OSA, improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> index and reduced sleep state transitions were not associated with significant changes in GH secretion rate by sleep stage; SWS [from 0.62 +/- 0.28 mIU/L/min to 1.02 +/- 0.25 mIU/L/min (NS)] and SI-II sleep [from 0.26 +/- 0.07 mIU/L/min to 0.60 +/- 0.16 mIU/L/min (NS)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in those five subjects, a GH secretion peak during the first 2 h of SWS was initially absent, appearing only after treatment of OSA (1.09 +/- 0.38 mIU/L/min) compared with (2.40 +/- 0.59 mIU/L/min (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A profile of overnight GH secretion is presented for subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
