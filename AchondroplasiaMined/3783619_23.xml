<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This survey reviews the diagnosis (predominantly radiological) of 32 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> from 26 kindreds and illustrates the natural history and varying appearance of the disordered bone growth from infancy to adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, an attempt has been made to detect phenotypic differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> and recessive types (excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo>), analysing 10 kindreds of dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> (three in the current survey, seven from published reports) and six of recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> (three in the current survey, three from published reports) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There appears to be no clinical or radiographical feature which clearly distinguishes them, but, using height as a criterion of severity, among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> there was a disproportionate number of the most severely affected cases and there also appears to be very little intrafamilial variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is possible that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e> can be subdivided into <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mild and severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> mild and severe, but full delineation must await elucidation of the basic defect at biochemical and molecular levels </plain></SENT>
