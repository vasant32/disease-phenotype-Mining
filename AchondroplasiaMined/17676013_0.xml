<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparatively few reports have analyzed the biological factors influencing the course of distraction osteogenesis, such as the etiology and magnitude of shortening or the patient's age at surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to assess the impact of selected biological factors on the course of bone regeneration in distraction osteogenesis of the lower leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Material and method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined 126 patients, on whom 138 lower leg lengthening operations were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Congenital shortening was the most numerous cause (54.9%), followed by postinfectious (16.6%), posttraumatic (14.3%), neurogenic (7.9%), and achondroplastic (6.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The course of distraction osteogenesis was analyzed on the basis of duration of treatment, expressed by the lengthening index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The highest lengthening index values were found in neurogenic patients, somewhat lower in congenital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest lengthening index values were observed in postinfectious and posttraumatic shortenings, and in the group of bi-level lengthenings in achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lengthening index decreased along with increasing elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower lengthening index values were found in patients younger than 20 years, regardless of the method and number of osteotomy levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is clinical evidence for the impact of etiology, age, and magnitude of shortening on the course of distraction osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The shortest treatment duration was found in shortening of acquired etiology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, and in patients older than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The values of the lengthening index were the lowest in lengthenings over 6 cm, whereas the greatest values were observed in lengthenings less than 4 cm </plain></SENT>
