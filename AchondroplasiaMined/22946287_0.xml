<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The homeobox gene SHOX encodes a transcription factor which is important for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limb development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5 to 10% of short patients exhibit a mutation or deletion in either the SHOX gene or its downstream enhancer regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, SHOX deficiency has been associated with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> syndromes as well as non-syndromic idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A common feature of these syndromes is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003498'>disproportionate short stature</z:hpo> with a particular shortening of the forearms and lower legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003067'>Madelung deformity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002967'>cubitus valgus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003712'>muscular hypertrophy</z:hpo> also differed markedly between patients with or without SHOX gene defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A clinical trial in patients with SHOX deficiency and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041408" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Turner syndrome</z:e> demonstrated highly significant growth hormone-stimulated increases in height velocity and height <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Employing microarray analyses and cell culture experiments, a strong effect of SHOX on the expression of the natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> BNP and the fibroblast growth factor receptor gene FGFR3 could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that BNP was positively regulated, while Fgfr3 was negatively regulated by SHOX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A regulation that occurs mainly in the mesomelic segments, a region where SHOX is known to be strongly expressed, offers a possible explanation for the phenotypes seen in patients with FGFR3 (e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>) and SHOX defects (e.g. LÃ©ri-Weill dyschondrosteosis) </plain></SENT>
