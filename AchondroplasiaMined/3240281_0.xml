<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From the psychological-social point of view, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> is a complex disorder; in fact, one must take into consideration aspects of the body image, family-surroundings reaction and possible corrective therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The achondroplast has a physical image that coincides with his personality and from this standpoint it does not appear to be problematic in the sense that (if accepted right from the start as such) there is a natural acceptance of the disorder, complicated only by the practical difficulties in adapting to a world created for non-achondroplasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medieval court jester, who was generally a well-adapted achondroplast, is proof of what we have been saying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The problem of the achondroplast arises when his surroundings, right from the start, reject his disorder, connoting it with destructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>: this seriously harms the subject's physical image, making him an outcast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even though it is difficult to direct the reaction of the family-surroundings, it is the only way to prevent the achondroplast from suffering greatly and to guarantee the best results from a corrective operation, instead of a renewed rejection </plain></SENT>
