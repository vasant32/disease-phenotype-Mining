<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical decompression by means of laminectomy is recommended often, but its long-term results have not been assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical history of 22 achondroplastic patients who had at least one TLS laminectomy performed before 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms predated the first TLS laminectomy by a mean of 2.3 years (range 0.1-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 91% of patients had motor function impairment, 86% had sensory dysfunction, 86% had neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, 77% had radicular pain, 59% had symptomatic bladder dysfunction, and 32% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002607'>fecal incontinence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only upper motor neurons were affected in 45%, only lower motor neurons in 27%, and both in 27% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up after the first TLS laminectomy averaged 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 patients who initially improved neurologically, 12 had functional improvement for more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 11 of these 12 subsequently regressed and 10 had additional laminectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term neurologic and functional improvement was associated with both a short duration of symptoms preoperatively and absence of cervical stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of hypertrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, 9 patients developed compression at the site of the initial TLS laminectomy and required re-operation 6.4 years (range 1-11 years) later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TLS laminectomy is an effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003416'>spinal stenosis</z:hpo> if performed early in the course of the neurologic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, some patients have, or later develop, compression adjacent to the myelographic site of stenosis, and some develop hypertrophic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> at the site of initial decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that the first TLS laminectomy extend (1) 3 levels cephalad to the myelographic block, (2) at least to S2, and (3) laterally at least to the facets </plain></SENT>
