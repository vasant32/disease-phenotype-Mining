<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the gene mutation of Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>(ACH) and to set up a simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The specific fragment of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) transmembrane domain was amplified from dried blood spots of 21 patients with ACH and 6 suspicious patients with ACH by polymerase chain reaction, then mutation was screened and detected by restrictive enzyme analysis, single strand conformation polymorphism(SSCP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One out of 6 suspicious cases was ACH and 5 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0410538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSACH">pseudoachondroplasia</z:e>(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PSACH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one out of 22 patients with ACH bore a G to A transition at nucleotide 1138 and 1 bore a G to C transversion at this same position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nucleotide 1138 of FGFR3 gene is also the hotspot of mutation in Chinese patients with ACH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method has been set up to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
