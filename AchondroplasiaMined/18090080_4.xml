<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize pedicle and spinal canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the achondroplastic lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and to suggest dimensions for improving pedicle screw selection and placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although morphometric population studies exist for various races, to our knowledge, no such analysis has been made in achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With computer software, we measured pedicle parameters on the computed tomography images of 19 adult achondroplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pedicle and chord lengths ranged from 9.5-12.5 mm and 29.5-36.4 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transverse pedicle diameter increased from T9 (5.5 mm) to L5 (14.2 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sagittal pedicle diameter declined from L1 (11.6 mm) to L5 (7.8 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transverse angulation was greatest at L5 (15.7 degrees ) and smallest at T12 (1.1 degrees ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pedicles were directed cranially at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels, ranging from 3.8 degrees -15.6 degrees  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interpedicular distance and cross-sectional area were smallest at L4 (14.9 mm and 119 mm, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pedicle starting points diverged from T9 (13.6 mm) to L5 (19.2 mm2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Achondroplastic pedicle <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> differs markedly from those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spine: chord lengths are substantially shorter, pedicles are inclined cranially, pedicle starting points diverge progressively in the lumbar spine, and pedicle shape transitions from vertically to horizontally oriented ellipsoids along the lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consideration of this variation could maximize the effectiveness and safety of pedicle instrumentation </plain></SENT>
