<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the birth prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mutations in Spain and estimated how a decrease in maternal age distribution may lead to reduction in dominant mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data were collected by the Estudio Colaborativo Español de Malformaciones Congénitas from April, 1976, to December, 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 553,270 liveborn infants monitored during the period, 66 infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> conditions were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Hay-Wells, Treacher-Collins, Robinow, Stickler, Adams-Oliver, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000581'>blepharophimosis</z:hpo> syndromes, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CLCD">cleidocranial dysostosis</z:e>, and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> conditions was 1.2 per 10,000 liveborn infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (20%) had an affected relative, and 52 (79%) had a negative family history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case was excluded because of insufficient family data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> mutations was 0.9 per 10,000 liveborn infants, or 47 per 1 million gametes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reduction in the maternal age distribution of mothers age 35 years and older from the current 10.8% to 4.9%, as in Atlanta, Georgia, would reduce the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> in Spain by 33% and through a change in parternal age distribution may lead to a reduction in dominant mutations of about 9.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a public health campaign to reduce older maternal age distribution in Spain may also lead to a reduction in dominant mutations and emphasizes the potential that a direct campaign for fathers to complete their families before age 35 years may have a small, but measurable, effect in the primary prevention of dominant mutations </plain></SENT>
