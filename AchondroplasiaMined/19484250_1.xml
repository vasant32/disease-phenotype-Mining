<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial application and validate the clinical utility of multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA) in demonstrating the vertebral arteries in relation to the cervical spine and associated pathology prior to surgical intervention in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CTA images were obtained in ten children prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively gathered cases of cervical spine pathology that underwent CT angiography prior to surgery over the course of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The images were reviewed by two neuroradiologists and discussed with the neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten children were imaged; three children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005967" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone tumours</z:e>, four had segmentation anomalies, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heterotopic calcification</z:e> and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0266798,C0037926" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cord compression</z:e> post-surgical craniocervical fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vertebral arteries were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children, and the course was visualised in relation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological bony <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> on axial 2D and volume-rendered 3D volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no complications of the procedure and no need for magnetic resonance angiography or catheter angiography in any cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital deformity</z:e>, small size and a recent trend toward instrumentation of the craniocervical junction in the paediatric population mandates accurate knowledge of the vertebral artery relationships to the local neural and bony structures prior to complex surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whilst we do not advocate imaging of the vertebral arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients requiring cervical spine surgery, this technique has been shown to be a very useful investigation in selected cases </plain></SENT>
