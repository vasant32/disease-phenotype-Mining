<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Missense mutations of human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) result in several <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo>, including hypochondroplasia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and thanatophoric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the function of FGFR3 in bone growth and to create animal models for the FGFR3-related inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorders</z:e>, we introduced a point mutation (Lys644Glu) into the murine FGFR3 genome using a knock-in approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the Lys644Glu mutation resulted in retarded endochondral bone growth with severity directly linked to the expression level of the mutated Fgfr3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice heterozygous for the mutation ( Fgfr3(TD/+) ) expressed the mutant allele at approximately 20% of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> level and exhibited a mild bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when the copy number of the mutant allele increased from one (Fgfr3(TD/+) to two (Fgfr3(TD/TD), the retardation of bone growth became more severe and showed phenotypes resembling those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> patients, characterized by a dramatically reduced proliferation of growth plate cartilage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> and shortening of the long bones, which was most pronounced in the femur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis revealed that expression of the mutant receptor caused the activation of Stat1, Stat5a and Stat5b, and the up-regulation of p16, p18 and p19 cell cycle inhibitors, leading to dramatic expansion of the resting zone of chondrocytes at the expense of the proliferating chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutant growth plates consequently were in a less active state and generated fewer maturing and hypertrophic chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data provide direct genetic evidence that the point mutations in FGFR3 cause human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasias</z:hpo> and uncover a mechanism through which the FGFR3 signals regulate bone growth by modulating expression of Stats and ink4 cell cycle inhibitors </plain></SENT>
