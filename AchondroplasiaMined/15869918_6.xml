<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that C-type natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (CNP) stimulates endochondral ossification and corrects the reduction in body length of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> model mouse with constitutive active fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to examine the interaction between CNP and FGFR-3, we studied intracellular signaling by using ATDC5 cells, a mouse chondrogenic cell line, and found that FGF2 and FGF18 markedly reduced CNP-dependent intracellular cGMP production, and that these effects were attenuated by MAPK inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated that the level of GC-B, a particulate guanylyl cyclase specific for CNP, was not changed by treatment with FGFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, CNP and 8-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-cGMP strongly and dose-dependently inhibited the induction of ERK phosphorylation by FGF2 and FGF18 without changing the level of FGFR-3, although they did not affect the phosphorylation of STAT-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the organ-cultured fetal mouse tibias, CNP and FGF18 counteracted on the longitudinal bone growth, and both the size and number of hypertrophic chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FGF/FGFR-3 pathway is known as the negative regulator of endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that FGFs inhibited CNP-stimulated cGMP production by disrupting the signaling pathway through GC-B while CNP antagonized the activation of the MAPK cascade by FGFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the CNP/GC-B pathway plays an important role in growth plate chondrocytes and constitutes the negative cross talk between FGFs and the activity of MAPK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results may explain one of the molecular mechanisms of the growth stimulating action of CNP and suggest that activation of the CNP/GC-B pathway may be effective as a novel therapeutic strategy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
