<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were fibular <z:mp ids='MP_0008985'>hemimelia</z:mp> (two), <z:hpo ids='HP_0008845'>mesomelic dwarfism</z:hpo> (two), posteromedial bow (one), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> (one), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">poliomyelitis</z:e> (one), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (one), posttraumatic limb-length discrepancy (one), and hypochondroplasia (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average age was 24.5 years (range, 15-54 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The screw (length, typically 125 mm; diameter, 7 mm) was inserted with the ankle in 10 degrees dorsiflexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gastrocnemius soleus recession was performed in two patients to achieve 10 degrees dorsiflexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average lengthening was 4.9 cm (range, 3-7 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screws were removed after a mean 3.3 months (range, 2-6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative ankle range of motion was regained within 6 months of screw removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No neurovascular complications were encountered, and no patients experienced equinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also conducted a cadaveric study in which one surgeon inserted screws in eight cadaveric legs under image intensifier control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The flexor hallucis longus muscle belly was the closest anatomic structure noted during dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The screw should be inserted obliquely from upper lateral edge of the calcaneus and aimed lateral in the tibia to avoid the flexor hallucis longus muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study </plain></SENT>
