<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the Lys-650 mutants are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfisms</z:hpo> with graded clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess the importance of the phosphorylation level on FGFR3 maturation along the secretory pathway, hemagglutinin A-tagged derivatives were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The highly activated SADDAN (severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>) mutant accumulates in its immature and phosphorylated form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which fails to be degraded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Janus kinase (Jak)/STAT pathway is activated from the ER by direct recruitment of Jak1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abolishing the autocatalytic property of the mutated FGFR3 by replacing the critical Tyr-718 reestablishes the receptor full maturation and inhibits signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differently, the low activated hypochondroplasia mutant is present as a mature phosphorylated form on the plasma membrane, although with a delayed transition in the ER, and is completely processed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Signaling does not occur in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48080">brefeldin A</z:chebi>; instead, STAT1 is activated when protein secretion is blocked with monensin, suggesting that the hypochondroplasia receptor signals at the exit from the ER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that kinase activity affects FGFR3 trafficking and determines the spatial segregation of signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the defect in down-regulation of the highly activated receptors results in the increased signaling capacity from the intracellular compartments, and this may determine the severity of the diseases </plain></SENT>
