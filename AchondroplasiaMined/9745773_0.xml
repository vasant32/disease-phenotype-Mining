<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the mutations in the gene encoding FGFR-3 in 15 Korean children with ACH, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with ACH showed the same mutation as those reported in France, USA and Japan; a G--&gt;A transition at position 1138 of the coding sequence, resulting in the substitution of arginine for glycine at position 380 of the mature protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This consistent point mutation of Korean children with ACH indicates there is no significant racial difference in the pathogenesis of ACH, compared with data from Caucasian and Japanese children with ACH </plain></SENT>
