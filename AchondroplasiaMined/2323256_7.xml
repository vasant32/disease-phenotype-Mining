<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to experimental models of apneusis, these patients appeared to have intact vagal function and no evidence of pontine disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients displayed clinical, structural, and electrophysiologic features of cervicomedullary compression, a well-recognized complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of apneustic breathing was reduced in the majority of our patients following decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Traditional theories on the pathogenesis of apneustic breathing cannot satisfactorily explain the presence of apneustic breathing in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that cervicomedullary compression may be capable of producing apneustic breathing in the absence of vagal or pneumotaxic center lesions </plain></SENT>
