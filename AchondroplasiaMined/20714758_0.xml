<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An achondroplastic patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> was first seen at the age of 16 at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>His only concern at that time was the aesthetic implication of his deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His physical examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for loss of the neurologic reflexes in the lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The radiographs showed a fixed 180Â° <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> with correct frontal and sagittal balances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No spinal cord anomaly was found on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two years later, he developed a progressive neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> of the lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He was still neurologically intact at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MRI showed an abnormal central spinal cord signal in front of the apex of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> associated with the narrow congenital spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In regards to this progressive neurological worsening, a surgical treatment was decided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We decided to perform a front and back <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> combined with a spinal cord decompression without reduction of the deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A five-level hemilaminotomy was performed with a posterior approach at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spinal cord was individualised onto 10 cm and the left nerve roots were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A decancellation osteotomy of the three apex vertebrae and a disc excision were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The posterior aspect of the vertebral body was then translated forward 2 cm and in association with the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two nerve roots were severed laterally to approach the anterior part of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> and a peroneal strut graft was inlayed anterolaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A complementary anterior and a right posterolateral fusion was made with cancellous bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The patient was immobilised in a cast for 3 months relayed by a thoracolumbosacral orthosis for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At 3 years follow-up, the neurogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No worsening of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>His only complaint is violent electric shock in the lower limbs with any external sudden pressure on the spinal cord in the area uncovered by bone </plain></SENT>
