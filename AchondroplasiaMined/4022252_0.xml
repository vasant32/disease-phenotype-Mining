<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ICP determination in the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocrania</z:hpo> with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo> important for knowing pathologic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular, pressure variation and amplitude changes during REM period seem to be an interesting index for knowing the involvement of venous function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased ICP during REM period was also observed in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001360'>holoprosencephaly</z:hpo> having brain stem formation only, suggesting an important relationship between brain stem and increased ICP during REM period </plain></SENT>
