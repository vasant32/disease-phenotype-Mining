<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Achondroplasia</z:e> mainly affects the chondrocytes and therefore bones do not grow properly since intracellular pathways are altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this sense, defective calcium signaling by mutant FGFR3 has been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of purinergic P2Y receptors and how the activation of these receptors can have influence on defective calcium signaling observed in achondroplasic chondrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of P2Y receptors was determined by immunocytochemical and western blot techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Calcium mobilization after stimulation with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi>, or, FGF9 application, was measured using the ratiometric dye fura-2/AM and fluorescence imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the expression of P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(6) and P2Y(11) receptors in achondroplasic chondrocytes, as well as the activation of these receptors after <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The altered calcium signaling of achondroplasic chondrocytes was confirmed, since FGF9 treatment fails to induce calcium mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, achondroplasic chondrocytes pre-treated with Ap(4)A are able to respond with increases in intracellular calcium after FGF9 stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings show the rescue effect of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A), acting by means of P2Y receptors, on defective calcium response triggered by achondroplasic FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
