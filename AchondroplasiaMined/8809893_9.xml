<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To provide data about the frequency of prenatal misdiagnosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>), we retrospectively abstracted data from 37 consecutive referrals of infants with <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> where ultrasound was performed prenatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of 37 (24 per cent) had a positive family history of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine were correctly diagnosed prenatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 28 with no family history of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>, 16 (57 per cent) were recognized to have abnormalities on ultrasound but none was given a definite diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five families received an appropriate diagnosis of "most likely' <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> and four others were given a non-specific (but appropriate) diagnosis of some dwarfing disorder, not otherwise specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In seven instances (25 per cent), an incorrect diagnosis of a lethal or very severe disorder was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results illustrate the difficulty of making a specific prenatal diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the face of the resulting uncertainty, physicians appear to elect to emphasize the most severe of alternative diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the homogeneity of mutations within the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene in the vast majority of patients with <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">Ach</z:chebi>, FGFR3 mutational analysis can be offered in every instance where a short-limb disorder is ultrasonographically detected in the latter stages of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would reduce the amount of incorrect and potentially harmful information provided to families </plain></SENT>
