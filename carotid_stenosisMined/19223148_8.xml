<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis that silent embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on computed tomography (CT) brain scans can predict ipsilateral neurologic hemispheric events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective multicenter natural history study, 821 patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> graded with duplex scanning who had CT brain scans were monitored every 6 months for a maximum of 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex scans were reported centrally, and stenosis was expressed as a percentage in relation to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distal internal carotid criteria used by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT brain scans were reported centrally by a neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 146 patients (17.8%), 8 large cortical, 15 small cortical, 72 discrete subcortical, and 51 basal ganglia ipsilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present; these were considered likely to be embolic and were classified as such </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> types, lacunes (n = 15), watershed (n = 9), and the presence of diffuse white matter changes (n = 95) were not considered to be embolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 44.6 months (range, 6 months-8 years), 102 ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in 16, 38 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> [<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>], and 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) occurred, 138 patients died, and 24 were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 462 patients with 60% to 99% stenosis, the cumulative event-free rate at 8 years was 0.81 (2.4% annual event rate) when embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were absent and 0.63 (4.6% annual event rate) when present (log-rank P = .032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 359 patients with &lt;60% stenosis, embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were not associated with increased risk (log-rank P = .65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with 60% to 99% stenosis, the cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate was 0.92 (1.0% annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate) when embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were absent and 0.71 (3.6% annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate) when present (log-rank P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup of 216 with moderate 60% to 79% stenosis, the cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate in the absence and presence of embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 0.90 (1.3% annual rate) and 0.65 (4.4% annual rate), respectively (log-rank P = .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of silent embolic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can identify a high-risk group for ipsilateral hemispheric neurologic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may prove useful in the management of patients with moderate asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
