<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bulky equipment, the lack of knowledge about the appropriate antithrombotic regimen, and the impossibility at early stage to influence distal embolization added to the pressure on the investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At times, the confrontation with the surgical community has been hard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The technique evolved with the inputs of multiple disciplines on both sides of the Atlantic including radiology, cardiology, neuroradiology and vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major breakthrough included the use of dual antiplatelet therapy, of self-expanding stents and of emboli protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, randomized investigations against surgery started too early, in a phase in which the cas technique was not yet mature and the investigators lacked the necessary experience in terms of catheter skills and appropriate patient selection </plain></SENT>
