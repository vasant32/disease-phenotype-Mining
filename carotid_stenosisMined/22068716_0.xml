<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the most effective treatment method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgeons typically check the blood flow in each vessel using Duplex Doppler ultrasonography or radiocontrast angiography in order to prevent postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262004" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Embolic cerebral infarction</z:e> on the ipsilateral side has been reported in 4-7% of patients undergoing CEA despite a tolerable blood flow reported by Duplex ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate a new intraoperative method for detecting technical errors during CEA using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion underwent CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both ICG angiography and Doppler ultrasonography were performed before the carotid arterial incision and after the carotid arterial suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After injecting ICG dye via an intravenous route, the internal surface, atheroma, and flow defect were visualized with a microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In ICG angiography, stenotic lesions could be identified as regions of relatively dark signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnified real-time images could be created using a microscope with an infrared filter, including three-dimensional images and detailed images of the inner lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These images could then be compared with the results of Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the six cases assessed by both ICG angiography and Doppler ultrasonography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Doppler results were acceptable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, one patient underwent revision surgery because a fluttering atheroma was detected by ICG angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography could assume the extent of severe stenotic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography could also detect mobile lesions such as a fluttering atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative ICG angiography before arteriotomy is useful to determine the precise stenotic area and the shape of the associated plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography after an arteriotomy site is sutured is also useful for detecting residual stenosis or fluttering atheroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography could be an alternative method to Doppler ultrasonography for ensuring a complete and successful operation and preventing complications </plain></SENT>
