<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 73-year-old female visited her local doctor after repeatedly experiencing temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in her left upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent a cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and was diagnosed with right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite administration of antiplatelet drugs, her symptoms continued, and she was referred to our department for medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her medical history revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and performed carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, tight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> between the carotid artery and surrounding tissue made separation difficult, and surgery had to be discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the extracted adherent tissue consisted of hyalinized fibrous tissue that had the appearance of soft tissue which had organized because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there have been no reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> directly causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> around the internal carotid artery, it has been reported to have led to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation in the parapharyngeal space adjacent to the carotid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because the boundaries of the parapharyngeal space and carotid space are anatomically incomplete, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> often affects the area between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, this report, which also includes a discussion of the literature, is the first to indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> causes strong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesions</z:e> around the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
