<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective study sought to determine early and long-term neurocognitive outcomes after CEA for severe unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2006 to December 2008, 75 symptomatic (group A) and 70 asymptomatic patients (group B) aged 65 years and older underwent CEA under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight age- and sex-matched individuals who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period at our institution served as a control group (group H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with contralateral severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, or a history of major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive function was assessed using 2 neuropsychological tests (the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) performed preoperatively (T0) and then 3 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A change of at least 2 points between the scores at T0 and T2 was arbitrarily considered as clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At T0, group A revealed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in both mean test scores by comparison with group H (P = .005 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no significant differences between groups A and B, or between groups B and H </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, symptomatic patients had significant improvements in their mean cognitive performance scores in both tests (P &lt; .01 and P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas there were no changes in the asymptomatic and control patients' scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences emerged for the MMSE scores in the 3 groups, whereas there was a marginally significant difference in the MoCA scores between groups A and H (P = .08), but not for A versus B or B versus H when clinically significant scores were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study showed that only elderly symptomatic patients with severe carotid lesions had a significant improvement in cognitive performance scores after CEA, although the benefit was considered clinically not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CEA does not diminish neurocognitive functions, but it might provide some protection against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
