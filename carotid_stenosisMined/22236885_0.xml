<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective, multicenter clinical trial enrolled 220 consecutive participants between November 29, 2006, and January 14, 2008, followed by a second cohort of 102 participants between January 14 and June 18, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enrolled participants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (symptomatic &gt;50% or asymptomatic &gt;80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first 220 subjects underwent distal EPD placement with a new large-diameter filter, and the second cohort of 102 underwent placement of an older EPD that is no longer manufactured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 322 participants were to be treated with a dedicated carotid stent with a tapered, small, closed-cell design (Xact; Abbott Vascular) and were to be included in the long-term evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent neurologic assessment was performed before CAS and at 1 day, 30 days, and annually after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> primary end point events were independently adjudicated by a central committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The periprocedural composite end point of DSMI (95% confidence interval) in the first 220 participants was 2.3% (0.74%, 5.22%), with a combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 1.8% (0.50%, 4.59%) and a rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 0.5% (0.01%, 2.51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As of January 3, 2011, the median follow-up for the entire 322-subject cohort for the long-term evaluation was 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Freedom from the periprocedural composite of DSMI plus ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> thereafter was 95.4%, with an annualized ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 0.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAS outcomes in patients at high risk for CEA have improved from earlier carotid stent trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With periprocedural rates of DSMI of 2.3%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 1.8%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 0.5%, PROTECT has the lowest rate of periprocedural complications among other comparable single-arm CAS trials in patients at high risk for CEA </plain></SENT>
