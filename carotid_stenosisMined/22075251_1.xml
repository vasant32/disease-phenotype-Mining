<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IPH) is an emerging marker of plaque instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the relationships between IPH and traditional risk factors and whether these relationships differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four patients with symptomatic (n=114) or asymptomatic (n=120) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> underwent high-resolution plaque magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five patients had recent IPH (symptomatic, 33%; asymptomatic, 31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic stenosis, recent IPH was independently associated with degree of stenosis (odds ratio [OR]=4.21, 1.61-10.98 for North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial &gt;35%; OR=2.92, 1.18-7.24 for European Carotid Surgery Trial &gt;60%), qualifying event (OR=4.13; 1.11-15.32 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> ≥1 hour versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> &lt;1 hour or ocular symptoms), time from ischemic event (OR=6.65, 1.56-28.35 for ≤2 weeks; OR=2.24, 0.87-5.81 for 2-12 weeks versus &gt;12 weeks; P for trend=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic stenosis, IPH was only associated with stenosis severity &gt;70% by ECST (OR=6.65; 1.95-22.73) but not by the NASCET method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the potential link between recent IPH and risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in symptomatic disease but also imply that prognostic studies should adjust for known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors in multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic stenosis, the potential predictive value of recent IPH is less likely to be confounded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
