<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If this is the case, then it is important to determine risk reduction provided by treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Asymptomatic Carotid Emboli Study (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="39061">ACES</z:chebi>) prospective data, the effect of current treatment and risk factors on future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> risk were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four-hundred seventy-seven patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were followed-up every 6 months for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention therapies were reviewed at each visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using time-dependent Cox regression, the relationship between current treatment over time was determined and presented as hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, antiplatelets (P=0.001) and lower mean blood pressure (P=0.002) were independent predictors of reduced risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelets (P&lt;0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.0001) were independent predictors of a lower risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antiplatelet therapy and blood pressure control are the most important factors in reducing short-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cardiovascular risk in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More prospective data are required for medical treatments in asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in particular for current <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> usage </plain></SENT>
