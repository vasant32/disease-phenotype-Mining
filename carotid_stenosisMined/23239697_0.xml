<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stability of plaques appears to be a function of composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current non-invasive imaging techniques are limited in their ability to classify distinct histological regions within plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase-contrast (PC) X-ray imaging methods are an emerging class of techniques that have shown promise for identifying soft-tissue features without use of exogenous contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to apply analyser-based X-ray PC imaging in CT mode to provide three-dimensional (3D) images of excised atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results provide proof of principle for this technique as a promising method for analysis of carotid plaque microstructure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple image radiography CT (MIR-CT), a tomographic implementation of X-ray PC imaging that employs crystal optics, was employed to image excised carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MIR-CT imaging yields three complementary images of the plaque's 3D X-ray absorption, refraction and scatter properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These images were compared with histological sections of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>X-ray PC images were able to identify the interface between the plaque and the medial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-rich and highly vascularized regions were visible in the images as well as features depicting <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This preliminary research shows MIR-CT imaging can reveal details about plaque structure not provided by traditional absorption-based X-ray imaging and appears to identify specific histological regions within plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to apply analyser-based X-ray PC imaging to human carotid artery plaques to identify distinct soft-tissue regions </plain></SENT>
