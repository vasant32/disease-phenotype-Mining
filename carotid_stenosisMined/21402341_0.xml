<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is a risk factor for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective screening in detecting significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The case records of patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD), carotid bruit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, age &gt;70 years and/or history of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> detected by ultrasonography, surgical management and perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were determined in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent preoperative carotid screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was 5.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit (P=0.003) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group (1.2%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (5/205) were in the high-risk group (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged &gt;70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact on surgical management or neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
