<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We consecutively registered patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (50%-79%) measured by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) over 10 years and compared the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between treatment groups (surgical group vs medical group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 406 registered patients, 163 (108 treated surgically and 55 treated medically) with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up data (mean, 4.2 years) were available for 105 patients in the surgical group (97.2%) and 54 patients in the medical group (98.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was associated with lower incidences of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> compared with medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence rates differed significantly between CEA and medication in the 66 symptomatic patients, there were no significant differences in the 93 asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this single-center study in Japanese patients suggest that CEA is an acceptable treatment for patients with symptomatic moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, but that CEA for asymptomatic moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> seems to be less effective in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
