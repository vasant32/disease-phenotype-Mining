<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The right and left sides of the brain play different roles in cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the side of treatment should be taken into consideration when evaluating cognitive outcome following revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we designed a study to evaluate changes in right hemisphere cognitive function in patients undergoing right carotid artery stentings (CAS) and left hemispheric cognitive function in patients undergoing left CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied CAS-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow to determine potential correlations with changes in cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a prospective assessment of 39 CAS patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were right-handed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with contralateral stenotic lesions were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients underwent CAS of the right internal carotid artery (Right CAS group) and 18 underwent CAS of the left internal carotid artery (Left CAS group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively and 6 months after endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was determined by 123I-labeled N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography before and 6 months after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the Right CAS group, postoperative performance intelligence quotient score (91.1 ± 18.2) was significantly improved compared with the preoperative score (84.9 ± 16.7; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the Left CAS group, postoperative verbal intelligence quotient score (104.0 ± 18.8) was significantly higher than that before endovascular treatment (97.9 ± 15.8; P &lt; .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly different from that before endovascular treatment in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, regional cerebrovascular reactivity of the treated side showed significant improvement after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Amelioration of cognitive function may be dependent on the side of revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Performance intelligence quotient improved after CAS in patients with severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Verbal intelligence quotient also improved on the left side after endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These effects seemed to involve improvement in regional cerebrovascular reactivity by CAS </plain></SENT>
