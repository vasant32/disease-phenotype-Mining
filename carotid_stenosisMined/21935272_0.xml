<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty thousand seven hundred twelve individuals who underwent carotid artery ultrasonography for health screening between March 2005 and March 2010 were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population was divided into four groups, according to the degree of stenosis, as Group A, below 29%; Group B, 30% to 49%; Group C, 50% to 74%; Group D, above 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical records of the individuals were investigated, and Fisher's exact test, chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests and a binary logistic regression model were used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was Group B, 5.5%; Group C, 0.9%; Group D, 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Old age, male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> were significantly higher in Groups C and D (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.048, and 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the males aged over 65 yr, the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> ≥ 50% and ≥ 30% were 4.0% and 18.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is not uncommon in Korea </plain></SENT>
