<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 2 groups differing in the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 was comprised of 93 patients (mean age 64+/-05 yr) without stenosis of internal carotid artery or with stenosis of less than - 50%, group 2 included 89 patients (mean age 67+/-0.5 yr) with hemodynamically significant stenosis of internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> over 50% is frequently associated with the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and stable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> of effort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase of the degree of stenosis was accompanied by a decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and minute volumes </plain></SENT>
