<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a general rule, in patients with multilevel atherosclerotic disease the symptomatic vascular discrict should be treated first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The entirely surgical approach with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and CABG is associated with high event rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, whenever in the work-up prior to cardiac surgery severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> is identified, the indication for CABG should be reassessed and the feasibility of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as an alternative treatment should be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If PCI is not an option, carotid artery stenting (CAS) prior to open heart should be considered if the expertise is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is multifactorial and the value of revascularization of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> prior to open heart surgery remains controversial, treatment of patients with severe bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> appears reasonable for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of carotid revascularization in patient with unilateral severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> should more long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention than merely perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main advantage of CAS compared with CEA in patients with advanced CAD is the reduction of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, an event associated to long term mortality </plain></SENT>
