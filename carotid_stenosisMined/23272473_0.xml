<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevention of those vascular events is mainly based on optimization of vascular risk factor treatment and antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> depends on several predictive factors but the main predictors are a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> territory and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that patients who experience non disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> related to a 70 to 99% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> should undergo carotid endarterectomy In patients with moderate symptomatic stenosis (between 50 to 69%), the decision to operate is more difficut because the benefit of carotid endarterectomy is less important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males, 75 year-old and older are more likely to benefit, particularly when carotid endarterectomy is performed within 2 weeks of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with asymptomatic stenosis, the benefit of carotid endarterectomy is highly debated, in particular because the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in non-operated patients has fallen over the last decades due to advances in medical therapy Selection of asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy should be guided by an assessment of several factors including comorbid conditions, life expectancy, and age </plain></SENT>
