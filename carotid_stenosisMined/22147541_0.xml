<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of a T2-weighted SPACE sequence (T2w-SPACE) to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> via several methods and compare its performance with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (ceMRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> underwent dark blood (DB)-MRI using a 3D turbo spin echo with variable flip angles sequence (T2w-SPACE) and ceMRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Images were coregistered and evaluated by two observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area, degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis (NASCET: North American Symptomatic Endarterectomy Trial; ECST: European Carotid Surgery Trial, and area stenosis), and vessel wall area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degree of NASCET stenosis was clinically classified as mild (&lt;50%), moderate (50%-69%), or severe (&gt;69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Excellent agreement was seen between ceMRA and T2w-SPACE and between observers for assessment of lumen diameter, lumen area, vessel wall area, and degree of NASCET stenosis (r &gt; 0.80, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECST stenosis was consistently higher than NASCET stenosis (48 ± 14% vs. 24 ± 22%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Area stenosis (72 ± 2%) was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) than both ESCT and NASCET stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DB-MRI of carotid arteries using T2w-SPACE is clinically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It provides accurate measurements of lumen size and degree of stenosis in comparison with ceMRA and offers a more reproducible measure of ECST stenosis than ceMRA </plain></SENT>
