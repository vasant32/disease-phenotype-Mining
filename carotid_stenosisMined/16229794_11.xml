<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first 1,115 patients recruited to the Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid Stenosis</z:hpo> and Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (ACSRS) study with a follow-up of 6 to 84 months (mean 37.1 months) were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasonography was used for grading the degree of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and for plaque characterization (types 1-5), which was performed before and after image normalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred sixteen ipsilateral ischemic hemispheric events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Image normalization resulted in 60% of plaques being reclassified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before image normalization, a high event rate was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After image normalization, 109 (94%) of the events occurred in patients with plaque types 1 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For patients with European <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid Stenosis</z:hpo> Trial (ECST) 70 to 99% diameter stenosis (equivalent to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET] 50-99%) with plaque types 1 to 3, the cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 14% at 7 years (2% per year), and for patients with plaque types 4 and 5, the cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 0.9% at 7 years (0.14% per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that asymptomatic patients with plaque types 4 and 5 classified as such after image normalization are at low risk irrespective of the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
