<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The degree of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> has traditionally been used as a marker of hemodynamic compromise and increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the hemodynamic effect of carotid atherosclerotic plaque length on cerebral blood flow has not previously been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether carotid plaque length, in addition to degree of stenosis, significantly affects carotid blood flow in patients with &gt;65% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutively treated surgical patients with unilateral &gt;65% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> at a single institution were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurements of plaque length, internal carotid artery (ICA) vessel diameter, and degree of stenosis were made from magnetic resonance angiography images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography flow maps were generated to estimate ICA flow compromise by calculating a ratio of the ipsilateral/contralateral ICA flow rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 38 eligible patients, 23 had full anatomic and ICA flow data sets available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate regression analysis demonstrated that longer carotid plaques and increasing percentage <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were associated with a significant decline in ipsilateral ICA flow (P = .008 and P = .02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate regression identified both plaque length and vessel diameter as independent predictors of ICA flow (P = .001 and P = .002, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque length and vessel diameter appear to be significant variables, in addition to degree of stenosis, in predicting ipsilateral carotid blood flow compromise in patients undergoing carotid revascularization </plain></SENT>
