<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to investigate the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of emergency carotid artery stenting (eCAS) for a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (ILT) with or without proximal flow control (PFC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> included in the analysis were those who were admitted between 2001 and 2010 with serious neurological symptoms, without a large high-intensity area of diffusion-weighted images and who underwent eCAS for a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with ILT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent eCAS without PFC until 2004 (group C) and under PFC after 2004 (group P) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission, just before CAS and 7 days after CAS as well as the 3-month modified Rankin Scale were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent eCAS, eight of whom had a high-grade stenosis with ILT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the eight patients were in group C and four were in group P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Probable distal embolism associated with eCAS occurred in two cases in group C and in none in group P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In groups C and P the median 7-day NIHSS scores were 15 and 5, respectively (p&lt;0.05) and the median 3-month modified Rankin Scale scores were 4 and 2, respectively (p&lt;0.05), but there were no significant differences between the two groups in the NIHSS scores on admission and just before CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with ILT, eCAS under PFC is safer and more effective in achieving a favorable clinical outcome than eCAS without PFC </plain></SENT>
