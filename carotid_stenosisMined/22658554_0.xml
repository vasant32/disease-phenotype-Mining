<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and plaque stability are critical determinants of risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to elucidate the association of CAC with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and plaque characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (MESA), a prospective cohort study of subclinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in multiethnic participants (N = 6814) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association between CAC measured by computed tomography and carotid ultrasonography of carotid plaque was examined using multiple logistic linear models adjusting for traditional vascular risk factors including ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also developed ethnic specific models to compare the relationship between CAC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> across the four ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was associated with the presence of CAC (OR 1.73; 95% CI, 1.20-2.49) and log-transformed Agatston score (OR per 1 point increase, 1.18; 95% CI 1.04-1.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was also associated with the presence of CAC (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.93-2.83) and log-transformed Agatston score (OR per 1 point increase, 1.53; 95% CI 1.38-1.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Irregular plaque surface was associated with the presence of CAC (OR, 1.87; 95% CI 1.50-2.32) and the log-transformed Agatston score (OR per 1 point 1 increase, 1.31; 95% CI 1.16-1.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Associations between CAC and stenosis/stability were not different across ethnicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both the presence of CAC and log-transferred Agatston score are independently associated with significant/overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and carotid plaque surface irregularity regardless of ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The subjects with a positive or increased CAC score are more likely to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> potentially increasing their risk for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
