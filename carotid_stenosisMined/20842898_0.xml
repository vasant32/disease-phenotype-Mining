<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Multislice CT angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive and quick technique to image carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, as well as intracerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Modern multidetector CTA produces images with a high resolution of, not only the contrast-filled lumen, but also of the vessel wall and the surrounding soft tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have verified the ability of CTA to provide an accurate representation of the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in comparison to digital subtraction angiography, both for moderate and high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of its fast and accurate vessel imaging, CT angiography is increasingly used in the assessment of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE: A 37-year-old female patient was admitted at the Vascular Surgery Clinic of the Institute for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">Cardiovascular Diseases</z:e> "Dedinje", Belgrade, for angiography and endovascular procedure of a high-grade stenosis of the left common carotid artery based on Multislice CT findings brought by the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She complained of problems which we considered to be the result of cerebral circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After detailed diagnostic procedures, we concluded that no pathological lesions could be verified either on the left common carotid artery or other supraaortic branches.Therefore, the patient was discharged for further neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although Multislice CTA has many advantages over classical angiography, its validity should be taken with reserve, especially in younger patients </plain></SENT>
