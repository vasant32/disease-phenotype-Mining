<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various cerebral pathological changes have been reported to cause leukoaraiosis (LA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that circle of Willis (CoW) anomalies may contribute to LA in severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> victims through impaired cerebral autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a retrospective review on cerebral magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) patterns in patients with severe symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and compared white matter lesion (WML) load between subjects with and without complete CoW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LA on fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images at the levels of the centrum semiovale and frontal horns in both cerebral hemispheres were scored in 106 patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (64 men and 42 women; mean age 68.7 ± 9.2 years, range 44-82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were divided into groups of complete and incomplete CoW according to cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in the LA scores between the groups of complete and incomplete CoW were further analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with those with incomplete configuration of the CoW, subjects with a complete CoW demonstrated a decreased WML load at the level of the centrum semiovale (2.78 ± 1.17 vs. 5.62 ± 2.12, p = 0.02) and frontal horns (2.21 ± 0.79 vs. 4.22 ± 1.83, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support the importance of a complete CoW since it may protect from WML in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
