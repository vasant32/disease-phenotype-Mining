<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate whether different presentation formats, presenter characteristics, and patient characteristics affect decision-making in asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects included individuals presenting to a neurology clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants included those over age 18 without known <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomized to a 30-second video with 1 of 5 presentation formats (absolute risk, absolute event-free survival, annualized absolute risk, relative risk, and a qualitative description) delivered by 1 of 4 presenter physicians (black woman, white woman, black man, white man) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects then completed a one-page form regarding background demographics and their decision regarding treatment choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 409 subjects watched the video and completed the survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 48.4% of subjects chose surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presentation format strongly predicted choice of surgery (qualitative [64%], relative risk [63%], absolute risk [43%], absolute event-free survival [37%], and annualized absolute risk [35%], p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for younger age (mean age 52 vs 55, p = 0.054), male gender (53% vs 45%, p = 0.08), and advanced education (42% for high school education or less vs 52% for more than high school education, p = 0.052) to predict surgery choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gender and race of presenter, and race of subject, had no influence on the choice of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Presentation format (information framing) strongly determines patient decision-making in asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subject age, gender, and education level may also influence the decision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should consider the influence of these variables when counseling patients </plain></SENT>
