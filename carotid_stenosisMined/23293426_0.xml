<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of progressive internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis by head and neck contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in 82 patients who underwent surgery, chemotherapy, or combination therapy for oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (OSCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 82 patients who underwent head and neck contrast-enhanced CT after surgery alone or combined surgery and chemotherapy for OSCC at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Ichikawa General Hospital, Tokyo Dental College, or Tokyo Dental College <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Oral Cancer</z:e> Center between December 2002 and March 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison with previously obtained head and neck contrast-enhanced CT images revealed progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> of the ICA in five patients with a mean age of 62.0Â years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients were male, and their OSCC sites were the tongue in two, the floor of the mouth in two, and the mandibular gingiva in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> resection and neck dissection were performed for four patients and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection alone for one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICA stenosis occurred on the same side as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that, given the possibility of post-treatment vascular events, attention must be paid to subsequent changes in the ICA over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results also indicate the usefulness of head and neck contrast-enhanced CT in identifying such problems </plain></SENT>
