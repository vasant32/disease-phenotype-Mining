<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> often coexist, many debate which patients are best served by combined concurrent revascularization (carotid endarterectomy [CEA]/coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the use of CEA/CABG in New England and compared indications and outcomes, including stratification by risk, symptoms, and performing center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using data from the Vascular Study Group of New England from 2003 to 2009, we studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent combined CEA/CABG across six centers in New England </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our main outcome measure was in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared outcomes between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing combined CEA/CABG to a baseline CEA risk group comprised of patients undergoing isolated CEA at non-CEA/CABG centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, we compared in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates between high and low neurologic risk patients, defining high neurologic risk patients as those who had at least one of the following clinical or anatomic features: (1) symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>, (2) bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt;70%, (3) ipsilateral stenosis &gt;70% and contralateral occlusion, or (4) ipsilateral or bilateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, compared to patients undergoing isolated CEA at non-CEA/CABG centers (n = 1563), patients undergoing CEA/CABG (n = 109) were more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (44% vs 29%; P = .001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> &gt;1.8 mg/dL (11% vs 5%; P = .007), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (23% vs 10%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing CEA/CABG were also more likely to take preoperative beta-blockers (94% vs 75%; P &lt; .001) and less likely to take preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (7% vs 25%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing CEA/CABG had higher rates of contralateral carotid occlusion (13% vs 5%; P = .001) and were more likely to undergo an urgent/emergent procedure (30% vs 15%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of complications was higher in CEA/CABG compared to isolated CEA, including increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5.5% vs 1.2%; P &lt; .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (5.5% vs 0.3%; P &lt; .001), and return to the operating room for any reason (7.6% vs 1.2%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 109 patients undergoing CEA/CABG, 61 (56%) were low neurologic risk and 48 (44%) were high neurologic risk but showed no demonstrable difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4.9% vs 6.3%; P = .76), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, (4.9 vs 6.3%; P = .76), or return to the operating room (10.2% vs 4.3%; P = .25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although practice patterns in the use of CEA/CABG vary across our region, the risk of complications with CEA/CABG remains significantly higher than in isolated CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future work to improve patient selection in CEA/CABG is needed to improve perioperative results with combined coronary and carotid revascularization </plain></SENT>
