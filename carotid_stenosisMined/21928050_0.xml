<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean platelet volume (MPV) could be a marker of platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to determine whether MPV levels were correlated with the presence of atherosclerotic disease in carotid arteries of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 215 patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the participants underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of their extracranial carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MPV was measured in automated hematology analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided according to plaques and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses and a ROC curve to predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a positive relationship between MPV and the degree of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.00007), and with carotid intima to media thickness (p &lt; 0.00002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ROC curve, a MPV cut-off of 11.25 fl was obtained for a sensibility of 70% and a specificity of 71% (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed significant correlation with severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, when MPV was higher than 11.25 fl (OR: 2.9, p &lt; 0.00007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that an elevated MPV could be an easily measurable marker of severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
