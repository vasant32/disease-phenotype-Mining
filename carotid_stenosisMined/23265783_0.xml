<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to study the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) among patients without intracranial large-vessel stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> without concomitant intracranial large-vessel stenosis having undergone carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WMH was quantified using the modified Fazekas scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were grouped into quartiles based on the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association among <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, vascular risk factors, and WMH were modeled using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 100 patients with a mean age of 56.2 ± 11.7 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The quartile with the greatest <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> had a mean internal/common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio of 2.36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total WMH was 4.64 in the highest quartile and 2.52 in the lowest quartile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Periventricular (pv)-WMH was significantly greater between the highest and lowest quartiles (2.80 versus 1.28, P = .025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed for deep subcortical WMH (1.84 versus 1.24, P = .281) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, increase in both ipsilateral and contralateral pv-WMH was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were compared to those without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, pv-WMH was significantly higher in the group with significant stenosis even after correcting for age and comorbid vascular risk factors (odds ratio 1.24; confidence interval 1.0-1.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is an important risk factor for WMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Volumes of pv-WMH significantly increase with higher grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
