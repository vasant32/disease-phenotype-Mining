<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to elucidate the role of ECA in cerebral flow of patients with total ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data of 139 patients with total ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided to symptomatic and asymptomatic and were categorized in four subgroups according to the stenosis rates: A) ipsilateral ECA&lt;70% and contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &lt;70%; B) ipsilateral ECA stenosis &lt;70% and contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> ≥70%; C) ipsilateral ECA stenosis ≥70% and contralateral ICA stenosis &lt;70%; D) ipsilateral ECA stenosis ≥70% and contralateral ICA stenosis ≥75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty eight (41.7%) patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The highest rate (48.2%) of asymptomatic patients was in Group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, the highest rate belonged in groups C and D (44.4% and 50% respectively) where ipsilateral ECA stenosis was ≥70% irrespectively of the contralateral ICA patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> ≥70% proved to be and independent risk factor for symptom presentation (P=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study reveals the significant role of ECA patency in cerebral flow in patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
