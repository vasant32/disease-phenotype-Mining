<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies from the past two decades, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk associated with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> has been estimated to be 2-2.5% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the relatively benign nature of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, it has been proposed that confining revascularization to a limited, higher-risk subgroup is a sensible strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evidence is accumulating that improved medical therapy has led to a lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in medically treated patients and that ultrasound methods can identify higher-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These developments are highlighted in this article </plain></SENT>
