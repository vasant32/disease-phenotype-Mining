<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> the overall annual risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has dramatically decreased over the past decades, due to improvement in medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is probably a better indicator of generalized atherosclerotic disease than of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, with an average risk of nonstroke <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (mainly due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>) generally higher than the risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Management of risk factors, antiplatelet therapy, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> are highly beneficial in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid surgery in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is associated with a small absolute benefit compared to medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is dramatically different from that of patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> because the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on medical treatment alone is very high and highest during the first few days and weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these patients, endarterectomy is highly beneficial and the absolute benefit of is increased in patients with 70- 99% stenosis, men, patients over 75 years, and in those treated within 2 weeks after the last event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The meta-analysis of the 3 major European trials comparing endarterectomy to stenting in symptomatic stenosis has shown an increased risk of perioperative risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the stenting group (74% increase in risk in patients treated with stenting) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after stenting and surgery were equivalent below the age of 70 whereas there was a two-fold increase in risk of stenting over endarterectomy above this age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, surgery remains the first line method in most cases but stenting is potentially an alternative in young patients </plain></SENT>
