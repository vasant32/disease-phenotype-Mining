<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We wanted to examine whether brain computed tomography (CT) perfusion can help to detect the reconstitution of cerebral hemodynamics and predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) after carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 2002 to October 2009, data of 114 patients with carotid intervention were prospectively collected, and we retrospectively identified a total of 108 consecutive patients with unilateral carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain CT perfusion was studied at three time points: 1 week before, and 1 week and 6 months after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow, and time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) of brain CT perfusion were examined at cortical and subcortical areas of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and posterior cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBV, cerebral blood flow, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> ratios of stenting side/nonstenting side were used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow direction of ophthalmic artery was detected by sonography, and the presence of anterior communicating artery was examined on prestenting cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After carotid stenting, CBV and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> ratios improved significantly in both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cortical and subcortical areas in patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (P &lt; .01) but not in patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with reversed ophthalmic flow had better improvement of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and posterior cerebral artery territories (P &lt; .05) than patients with forward flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was found between patients with and patients without anterior communicating artery collateral (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prestenting <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> ratio in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> subcortical area was significantly higher in patients with poststenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> than patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (P = .0191) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral hemodynamics can be reconstituted within a few days after carotid revascularization, especially in patients with reversed ophthalmic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> in prestenting <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> subcortical area may suggest a high risk of poststenting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
