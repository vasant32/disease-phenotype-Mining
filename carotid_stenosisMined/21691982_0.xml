<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our clinical results of CAS and CEA and suggest an appropriate treatment strategy, especially for high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 2001 to December 2009, we treated 171 carotid lesions by CEA and 251 lesions by CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was symptomatic in 68%, and the average stenotic rate was 83% in the CEA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the CAS group, stenosis was symptomatic in 62%, and the average stenotic rate was 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was relieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases after CEA or CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical mortality with CEA and CAS was 0.6% (1/171) and 0.4% (1/251), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical morbidity by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with CEA and CAS was 2.9% (5/171) and 1.2% (3/251), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical morbidity was not increased in patients with medical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term outcome after CAS was not inferior to that after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> can be treated with comparably low morbidity and mortality rates using CEA or CAS even in high-risk patients when the method is appropriately selected considering the characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
