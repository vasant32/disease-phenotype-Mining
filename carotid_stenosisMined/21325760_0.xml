<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether, among Japanese patients receiving medical treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was more strongly associated with subsequent neurological events than asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We consecutively registered Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of 50% or more as evaluated by digital subtraction angiography who were treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed medical records regarding previous neurological events as well as other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and underlying diseases at admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We monitored the occurrence and date of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after the first evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also attempted to obtain information from patients or their family members by means of a questionnaire or telephone survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 67 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of 50% or more who were treated medically, follow-up was completed in 62 subjects (56 men, 6 women; median age, 72 years; mean follow-up period, 37.3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of patients with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was five, while that with asymptomatic stenosis was four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher rate of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> compared with those with asymptomatic stenosis (p=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards model indicated that symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was significantly correlated with future neurologic events (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a Japanese population with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> treated medically, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is associated with future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> more frequently than asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
