<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of colour Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS), first-pass (FP) and steady-state (SS) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the carotid arteries using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 170 patients with previous cerebrovascular events and suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> underwent CDUS, blood-pool MRA, CTA and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for CDUS, FP MRA, SS MRA and CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The McNemar and Wilcoxon tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to determine significant differences (p&lt;0.05) between the diagnostic performances of the four modalities, and the degree of stenosis was compared using linear regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 336 carotid bifurcations were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve (AUC) for degree of stenosis was: CDUS 0.85±0.02, FP MRA 0.982±0.005, SS MRA 0.994±0.002 and CTA 0.997±0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AUC analysis showed no statistically significant difference between CTA and MRA (p=0.0174) and a statistically significant difference between CDUS and the other techniques (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> analysis showed no significant difference between CTA and SS MRA; a significant difference was seen between CTA and SS MRA versus FP MRA (p=0.04) and CDUS (p=0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaque ulceration analysis showed a statistically significant difference between MRA and CTA (0.04&lt; p&lt;0.046) versus CDUS (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTA is the most accurate technique for evaluating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e>, with a slightly better performance than MRA (97% vs. 95% for SS MRA and 92% for FP MRA) and a greater accuracy than CDUS (97% vs. 76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood-pool contrast-enhanced SS sequences offer improved evaluation of degree of stenosis and plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> with accuracy substantially identical to CTA </plain></SENT>
