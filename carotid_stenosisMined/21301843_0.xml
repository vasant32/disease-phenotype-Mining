<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to determine whether it is possible to identify a reliable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> threshold--measured in millimeters (mm)--that is associated with cerebrovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Written, informed consent was obtained for each patient; 149 consecutive patients (98 men; median age, 68 years) were studied for suspected pathology of the carotid arteries by using MDCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each patient, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was quantified using the mm-method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous data were described as the mean value ± standard deviation (SD), and they were compared by using the Student's t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A ROC curve was calculated to test the study hypothesis and identify a specific mm-stenosis threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was performed to include other MDCTA findings, such as plaque type and ulcerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those remaining, 75 patients suffered cerebrovascular symptoms (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.0046) in the mm-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> between patients with symptoms (1.31 ± 0.64 mm SD) and without symptoms (1.68 ± 0.79 mm SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that symptoms were associated with increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis (P = 0.013) and with the presence of fatty plaques (P = 0.0491) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the ROC curve (Az = 0.669; ±0.051 SD; P = 0.0009) indicated that a threshold of 1.6 mm stenosis was associated with a sensitivity to symptoms of 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest an association between <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis (measure in mm) and the presence of cerebrovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> stenosis of 1.6 mm is associated, with a sensitivity of 76%, with cerebrovascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
