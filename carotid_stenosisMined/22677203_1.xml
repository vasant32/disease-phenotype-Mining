<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> occurring in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One important reason is the absence of a good <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, after establishing different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> models in aged rats successfully, we investigated their cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Wistar rat models with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were established by ligating the common carotid artery along with various gauges of needle and then removing the needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cognitive performance was assessed using <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM) task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholinergic markers like <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>) were evaluated in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage was also studied through morphological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> led to impairment in learning ability and memory retrieval, accompanied with a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> level and morphological damage in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> rats had a partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, but there were no changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> level and morphological damage in hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> rats had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> compared to sham-operated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that different degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> induce different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive changes</z:e> in aged rats </plain></SENT>
