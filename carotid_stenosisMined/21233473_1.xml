<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical and laboratory factors to identify biomarkers for pre-existing carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 2006 and September 2008, 811 patients aged ≥50 years underwent preoperative carotid artery duplex scanning as part of a preoperative assessment for nonemergency cardiac procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 54 patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between various biomarkers and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and analyzed to compare diagnostic performance and optimum diagnostic cutoff levels of biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 757 patients was included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of ≥50% and ≥70% was 26.4% and 8.6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apoB):apoA-I, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> were independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of ��50%: the OR (95% CI) for apoB/apoA-I, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> in the highest versus lowest quartile was 2.07 (1.18 to 3.66), 2.17 (1.16 to 4.05), and 2.13 (1.20 to 3.79), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated area under the curve values of 0.708 (apoB:apoA-I), 0.678 (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>[a]), and 0.689 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (%) for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> ≥50% were 80.0, 50.4, 38.0, and 86.9 for apoB:apoA-I; 47.0, 78.9, 46.1, and 79.5 for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a); and 69.3, 62.1, 41.2, and 84.1 for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that plasma levels of apoB/apoA-I, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> can predict asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
