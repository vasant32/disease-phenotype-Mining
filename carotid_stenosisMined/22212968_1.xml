<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether inflammatory markers predict atherosclerotic disease activity after carotid treatment in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and nonsignificant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> undergoing carotid stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1, 2004, to September 30, 2005, a total of 55 consecutive patients (mean ± SD age, 69±8.3 years; 26 men) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and nonsignificant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were treated with carotid stent implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up for a period of 5 years for the occurrence of cardiovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant correlation between quantitative analysis of debris entrapped in the filters and inflammatory markers was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of particles per filter, the total particles area, and the mean particle axis per filter were significantly higher in patients with clinical events at the follow-up compared with patients without events (87 vs 32, P=.006; 50,118.7 vs 17,782, P=.002; 33.9 vs 30.2, P=.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 5-year follow-up we recorded cardiovascular or neurologic events in 11 of the 55 patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher preprocedural levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 soluble receptor, and interleukin 6 were significantly associated with clinical events at follow-up (P&lt;.001, P=.05, and P=.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measured at 24 and 48 hours after carotid stenting showed a significant correlation with clinical events (P=.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also preprocedural intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 and circulating vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1 blood concentrations were significantly correlated with a worse prognosis at follow-up (P=.04 and P=.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and nonsignificant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is associated with atherosclerotic disease activity and a worse prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 6, interleukin 6 soluble receptor, intracellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1, vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule 1, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels at baseline and 24 and 48 hours after carotid stenting are predictive of neurologic and cardiovascular events at follow-up </plain></SENT>
