<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Fish consumption and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake are shown to protect from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most fish contain environmental contaminants such as dibenzo-p-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="23825">dioxins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28145">dibenzofurans</z:chebi> (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated <z:chebi fb="21" ids="22888">biphenyls</z:chebi> (PCBs), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30785">methylmercury</z:chebi> (MeHg) that may have adverse effects on cardiovascular health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to elucidate the associations of fish consumption, omega-3 PUFAs, environmental contaminants with low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and traditional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Health 2000 survey participants (n=1173) represented the general Finnish population and the Fishermen study participants (n=255) represented a population with high fish consumption and high exposure to environmental contaminants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Model-adjusted geometric means and tests for linear trend were calculated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors by tertiles of fish consumption and serum omega-3 PUFAs, and additionally in the Fishermen study only, by tertiles of serum PCDD/F+PCB, and blood MeHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> decreased across omega-3 PUFA tertiles in both sexes and studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo>, C-reactive protein, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor α, and interleukin 6 decreased across omega-3 PUFA tertiles among the Health 2000 survey participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the Fishermen study men, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and arterial stiffness indicated by β-stiffness index tended to increase and the RR estimate for carotid artery plaque tended to decrease across tertiles of PCDD/F+PCB and MeHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Previously established hypotriglyceridemic and anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFAs were seen also in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hypothesised favourable effect on insulin sensitivity and arterial elasticity was suggested to be counteracted by high exposure to environmental contaminants but the effect on plaque prevalence appeared not to be harmful </plain></SENT>
