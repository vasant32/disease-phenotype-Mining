<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study whether people with stenosis of the carotid artery have increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo>, we studied 53 patients with moderate or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (with no symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) and 53 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe which cognitive functions were impaired in the patients and whether there were differences based on the side, the severity of the stenosis or the presence of neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, we found that the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> had lower cognitive performances in attention, verbal memory, visuospatial capacity and verbal fluency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with lesser degrees of stenosis than healthy control patients had better scores in learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results from this study suggest that patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> have a lower cognitive status than healthy control patients, which is associated with the degree of total <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
