<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> are vascularized, so neovessels may also contribute to plaque progression and vulnerability, but their precise role of neovessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the possible relationships among neovascularization, relevant angiogenic factors, and plaque vulnerability in patients with advanced carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group comprised 56 patients (stable: n=28, unstable: n=28) with advanced carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed for smooth muscle, endothelial, and inflammatory cells, macrophages, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and angiopoietin-1,-2 (Ang-1,-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the concentrations of angiogenic factors were measured in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantitative expression analysis was performed by SYBR-Green-based real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with stable carotid lesions, unstable carotid lesions showed 1.8-fold increase in neovascularization (P=0.013), which significantly correlated with accumulation of inflammatory cells (factor 1.9, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In unstable lesions, compared with stable lesions, VEGF was 1.7-fold increased (P=0.032) and Ang-1 was 1.9-fold reduced (P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, VEGF was higher in the blood of patients with unstable plaques than in stable plaques (0.32 ± 0.22 vs. 0.22 ± 0.16 ng/ml; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were observed between plaque vulnerability, VEGF, neovascularization and inflammatory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a close association between neovascularization, expression of angiogenic factors, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and plaque vulnerability in patients with advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
