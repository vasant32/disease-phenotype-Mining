<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is a minimally invasive procedure used as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy, especially in high surgical risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse the effectiveness and safety of the endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted in a retrospective analysis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> treated by means of CAS between February 2005 and April 2010, and the following information was recorded: demographic data, clinical diagnosis, indication of treatment, time between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and beginning of treatment, angiographic findings, complications and long-term follow-up (including the rate of restenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Altogether 121 patients were treated (77.8% males and 22.2% females), with a mean age of 70.8 ± 10.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main vascular risk factors were arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (65.3%), smoking (61.2%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> (42.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 86% of cases the stenoses were symptomatic and in the remaining 14% they were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 60.3% of cases they were stenoses &gt; 70%, in 30.6% they were preocclusive stenoses and in 9.1% they were recanalisations of unstable carotid occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean treatment time was 17.0 ± 8.3 days after the ischaemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The residual stenosis was less than 30% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality rate at 30 days was 4.1% and the rate of restenosis throughout a mean follow-up of 31.2 ± 10.8 months was 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our hospital CAS is considered an effective and safe technique, with a rate of complications that is within the parameters that justify its indication </plain></SENT>
