<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The introduction of CAS has led to increased treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to compare the effect of stent placement on cerebral perfusion in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using CT perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 45 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of â‰¥70% who underwent arterial stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients were treated because of symptoms; 14 asymptomatic patients were treated before coronary artery bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> before and after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We calculated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, CBV, and CBF, and derived relative numbers that compared treated with untreated hemispheres: ratios of CBV and CBF and difference in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of carotid stent placement on cerebral perfusion in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> perfusion parameters changed significantly after treatment in symptomatic patients: rCBF increased from 0.81 to 0.93 (P &lt; .001), rCBV decreased from 1.02 to 0.95 (P &lt; .05), and dMTT decreased from 1.29 to 0.14 (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In asymptomatic patients only, rCBF changed significantly with an increase from 0.92 to 1.03 (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When we compared symptomatic and asymptomatic patients before treatment, rCBF in symptomatic patients was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease of rCBV after treatment in symptomatic patients resulted in a significantly lower value than in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stent placement improves blood flow in the affected hemisphere in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CBF before treatment is more strongly impaired in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compensatory hyperemia on the symptomatic side before treatment (rCBV &gt; 1) turns into hypoxemia after treatment, suggesting impaired autoregulation in these patients </plain></SENT>
