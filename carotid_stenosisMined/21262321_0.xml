<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) are established tools for the assessment of arterial baroreflex and cardiac autonomic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aim of the study was to evaluate cardiac autonomic activity (by means of HRV, BPV and BRS) after CAS and to explore the impact of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on BRS changes after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>37 patients (68±10.45 years) with internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> underwent CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HRV, BPV and BRS were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects before and at 1 and 72h after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANOVA was performed to compare BRS, HRV and BPV parameters before and after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spearman analysis was performed to determine a possible correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> degree (or carotid plaque diameter) and BRS changes (ΔBRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LF/HF (index of sympatho-vagal balance) decreased during postoperative period, in comparison with baseline (2.32±1.70 vs 1.65±1.40, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> degree and ΔBRS (r=-0.35, p=0.03) and between carotid plaques thickness and ΔBRS (r=-0.36, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAS procedure may cause an alteration of carotid wall mechanical properties, increasing baroreflex sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BRS does not increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, because arterial wall damage and nerve destruction determined by atherosclerotic plaque may reduce ΔBRS </plain></SENT>
