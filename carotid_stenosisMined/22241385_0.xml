<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the safety of CAS using an emboli protection device in patients with severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging-depicted carotid IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a prospective data base that included 91 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and high-risk features who were treated with CAS by using an emboli protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight of the included patients underwent prestenting 3D TOF MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IPH was defined as the presence of high signal intensity within the carotid plaque, greater than 150% of the signal intensity of the adjacent neck muscle on TOF source images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was the combined incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MI, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations between IPH and the primary outcome were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IPH was detected on TOF MRA in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients were more common in the IPH group than in the non-IPH group (66.7% vs 41.7%; P = .032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MI, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were 6.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the IPH and non-IPH groups (10% and 6.25%, respectively; hazard ratio for IPH, 1.151; 95% CI, 0.035 to 37.500; P = .937) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression showed there was no independent variable associated with the primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that protected CAS seems to be safe in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and IPH </plain></SENT>
