<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1997 to November 2007, there were 387 patients operated on for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient data were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> and mortality from six different subgroups were analysed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The numbers of perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, as well as surgical and other perioperative complications were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall morbidity and mortality was 1.8% (seven patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was noted in 1.3% (five patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transitory ischaemic attacks within the first 30 days were observed in 1.6% (six patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only those patients who had intraluminal shunt insertion were found to have significantly higher morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(p = 0.000018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was observed in 0.5% (two patients), one fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have achieved acceptable morbidity and mortality rates (1.8%) according to the parameters set by previous studies such as Asymptomatic Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study and Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid Stenosis</z:hpo> Trial as well as American Heart Association and European <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Organisation guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surgeries were done under local anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Shunts were inserted in 22 cases (5.68%) </plain></SENT>
