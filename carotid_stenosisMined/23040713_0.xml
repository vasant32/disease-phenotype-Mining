<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous studies have investigated the development of new ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) after carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rate of ischemic brain injury after CAS for asymptomatic stenosis has not been extensively studied but is presumed to be less likely than in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study assessed the occurrence of cerebral embolization after CAS for asymptomatic vs symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During an 18-month period, 40 patients undergoing CAS under filter embolic protection were prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) during CAS and preprocedural and 24-hour postprocedural DW-MRI were used to assess cerebral embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate and nonparametric analyses were used to compare differences in cerebral embolization after CAS in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAS was performed for 23 asymptomatic (58%) and 17 symptomatic (42%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median microembolic counts detected by TCD were 285 (interquartile range [IQR], 182-376) for asymptomatic and 313 (IQR, 170-426) for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (P = .6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DW-MRI was available for assessment in 20 asymptomatic and 14 symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>New <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral emboli</z:e> detected with DW-MRI occurred in 10 asymptomatic (50%) and 7 symptomatic patients (50%) undergoing CAS (P = .9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral and total median number of DW-MRI lesions between groups were not statistically significantly different at, respectively, 1 (IQR, 0-2.5) and 1.5 (IQR, 0-3) for asymptomatic vs 0.5 (IQR, 0-2) and 0.5 (IQR, 0-3) for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (P &gt; .5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One asymptomatic patient sustained a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No new neurologic events occurred in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.5% in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral embolization, as detected by TCD and DW-MRI, occurs with a similar frequency after CAS for asymptomatic and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Because postprocedural ischemic brain injury occurs in approximately half of asymptomatic patients, the safety of CAS under filter embolic protection for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is uncertain and warrants further study </plain></SENT>
