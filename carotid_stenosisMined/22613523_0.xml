<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such patients have high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many studies show that carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative to treat unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the optimal procedural strategy of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety of simultaneous bilateral carotid artery stenting (SBCAS) compared with unilateral carotid artery stenting (UCAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, we analyzed 234 consecutive patients who underwent carotid stenting from January 2005 to December 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (16.7%) of them underwent SBCAS, and the others (n = 195) underwent UCAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indication for CAS was defined as carotid artery diameter reduction &gt; 60% (symptomatic) or &gt; 80% (asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six-month and 30-day hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>), hyperperfusion syndrome (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) after carotid stenting were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SBCAS group had no more <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> compared with UCAS group at 30 days (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>: 28.2% vs. 20.0%, P = 0.396; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>: 2.6% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.262) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between SBCAS group and UCAS group in major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, MI and their combinations within 30 days (major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: 0 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.604; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: 2.6% vs. 1.5%, P = 0.520; MI: 2.6% vs. 0.5%, P = 0.306; and their combinations: 5.1% vs. 4.6%, P = 1.000) and 6 months (major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: 0 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.604; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: 5.1% vs. 2.1%, P = 0.262; MI: 5.1% vs.1.0%, P = 0.130 and their combinations: 7.7% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.459) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The patients undergoing SBCAS had no more events than those undergoing UCAS in 30-day and 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our finding suggests that SBCAS appears to be as safe as UCAS </plain></SENT>
