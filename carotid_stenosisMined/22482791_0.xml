<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Several randomized trials have emerged with conflicting data on the overall safety of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in comparison with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors hypothesize that changes in national trends correspond to publication of randomized trials, including an increase in utilization of CAS after publication of trials favorable to CAS (for example, Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study [CAVATAS] and Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy [SAPPHIRE]) and decrease in utilization of CAS after publication of trials favorable to CEA (for example, Endarterectomy versus Stenting in Patients with Symptomatic Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid Stenosis</z:hpo> [EVA3-S] and Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy [SPACE]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was obtained for the years 1998-2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual cases were isolated for principal diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion undergoing CEA or CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CAS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid revascularization procedures was calculated for each year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perioperative inpatient morbidity, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of patients undergoing CAS increased yearly from the start of the observed period to the end, with the exception of a decrease in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The peak utilization of CAS for carotid artery revascularization procedures was 15% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was consistent at 5% among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing CEA for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> years, while the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> decreased among patients undergoing CAS from 9% in 1998 to 5% in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The practice of CAS in the US is expanding, from less than 3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid artery revascularization procedures to 13% in 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The utilization of CAS was seen to correlate with publication of randomized trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Utilization nearly doubled in 2005 after publication of the CAS-favorable SAPPHIRE in 2004, and decreased by 22% after publication of the CEA-favorable EVA-3S and SPACE in 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With the publication of Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST), the authors predict a resultant increase in the rate of CAS for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> in the upcoming years </plain></SENT>
