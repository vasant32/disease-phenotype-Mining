<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aimed at evaluating whether ultrasound monitoring of moderate asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> may help in identifying subjects at high risk for vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 523 subjects with unilateral asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of 50% to 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up carotid ultrasound was performed within 12 months from inclusion to detect the frequency and degree of stenosis progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were prospectively evaluated for a median period of 42 months (interquartile range, 38-45) after a second ultrasound evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> progression was associated with the occurrence of vascular events (hazard ratio, 21.57; 95% confidence interval, 11.81-39.39; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 96.7% of subjects without progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> remained free from vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with progressive stenosis, 53.7% experienced a vascular event and 27.1% experienced an ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-year moderate asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> progression is related to higher risk of vascular events, including ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
