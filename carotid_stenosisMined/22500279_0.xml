<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report is to describe the perioperative outcomes of standard carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with general anesthesia, routine shunting, and tissue patching in symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between October 2007 and July 2011, 22 patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (male/female, 19/3; mean age, 67.2±9.4 years) underwent a combined total of 23 CEAs using a standardized technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The strict surgical protocol included general anesthesia and standard carotid bifurcation endarterectomy with routine shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 8-French Pruitt-Inahara shunt was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the ischemic time, the shunts were inserted within 2.5 minutes, and 5 patients (22.7%) revealed ischemic cerebral signals (flat wave) in electroencephalographic monitoring but recovered soon after insertion of the shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean shunting time for CEA was 59.1±10.3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no perioperative mortality or even minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients woke up in the operating room or the operative care room before being moved to the ward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulty swallowing</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglossal nerve palsy</z:e>, but had completely recovered by 1 month postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Routine shunting is suggested to be a safe and reliable method of brain perfusion and protection during CEA in symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
