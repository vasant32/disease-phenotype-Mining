<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is significant variation in the indications for intervention in patients with recurrent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to describe these indications in a contemporary cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a systematic review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> peer-reviewed studies reporting on the indications for carotid intervention in patients with recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) that were published between 1990 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 50 studies reporting on a total of 3524 patients undergoing a carotid procedure; of these, 3478 underwent CEA as the initial intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reintervention was by CEA in 2403 patients and by CAS in 1121 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 54·7 per cent of the patients were treated for any symptoms and, importantly, just 444 (23·1 per cent of 1926 symptomatic patients) underwent intervention for documented ipsilateral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the studies reported whether the patients were evaluated for other sources of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 45·3 per cent of patients had asymptomatic restenosis and in the majority of the studies were treated when the degree of stenosis exceeded 80 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time to repeat intervention was significantly longer in patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, in asymptomatic patients and in patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The reported criteria for retreatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were not rigorous and there is still significant ambiguity surrounding the indications for intervention </plain></SENT>
