<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent evidence regarding carotid revascularization advises against carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) in patients aged &gt;70 years with conventional risk for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The poor outcome of transfemoral CAS in this age group may be explained by the anatomic characteristics of the aortic trunk and supra-aortic vessels in elderly patients, as well as by a high prevalence of aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcervical CAS with flow reversal for cerebral protection avoids these unfavorable characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed the short-term and middle-term results of transcervical CAS with flow reversal in patients aged &gt;70 years at high risk for CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2006 and January 2011, 219 cases of &gt;70% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in high-risk patients aged &gt;70 years (55.7% asymptomatic and 44.3% symptomatic) were treated by transcervical CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent complete neurologic examination by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neurologist before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), technical success, and complications at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, we analyzed the rate of restenosis ≥50% and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively and outcome was analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, including technical failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/MI rate was 2.2% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.8%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 2.2%; and MI, 0.45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/MI was 5.1% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 4.1%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the asymptomatic patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, MI, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Technical success was 96.3% (four inability to cross lesion, two major common carotid dissections, one failed preangioplasty, one stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One cervical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> required surgical drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (18.8 ± 16.9 months), cumulative (standard error) incidence of &gt;70% restenosis was 3% (1%) at 1 year and 8% (3%) at 2 and 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Only one patient experienced ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (standard error) was 94% (2%) at 1 year and 90% (3%) at 2 and 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, transcervical CAS with flow reversal is a safe technique for treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in patients aged &gt;70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We believe that avoiding the aortic arch and tortuous supra-aortic vessels is responsible for the favorable results in this study </plain></SENT>
