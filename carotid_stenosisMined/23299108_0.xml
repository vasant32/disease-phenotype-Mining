<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, carotid artery revascularization has an important role in the prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the treatment of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has currently gained acceptance as a safe alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA), particularly in patients at high surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasonography (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e>) is a non-invasive technique with standardized criteria used for the diagnosis of carotid atheromatous disease as well as for the detection of restenosis after carotid revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Restenosis rates vary widely in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Different studies indicated that restenosis following CAS was higher than following CEA, although the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST) reported similar restenosis frequency after 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given these results, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e> may have a significant role in the follow-up of CAS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e> velocity criteria are thought to be less accurate in patients who have undergone CAS and many authors proposed different criteria for grading in-stent restenosis (ISR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This review presents the advantages of CAS, the current practice of carotid revascularization, CAS complications and risks, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DUS</z:e> criteria for carotid artery ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After analyzing multiple relevant studies that proposed sonographic criteria for grading at least 70% ISR, we can conclude that a peak systolic velocity value of 300-350 cm/s could be used as a relatively good and sensitive predictor of high grade ISR </plain></SENT>
