<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible overestimation of the degree of contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> by duplex in patients with significant bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid stenoses</z:e> who are to undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing CEA in our center over a period of 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative duplex ultrasonography measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) were compared and used to classify the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis was performed to indicate possible predictors for contralateral stenosis overestimation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 384 CEA procedures in 357 patients were performed in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative bilateral duplex measurements were available in 135 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-four out of 135 patients (33%) were preoperatively identified as having significant stenosis (&gt;60%) of the internal carotid artery on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, postoperative duplex measurements of the contralateral carotid showed a decrease in mean (SD) PSV from 2.53 (1.11) m s(-1) to 1.97 (0.87) m s(-1) (P&lt;0.01) and a decrease in EDV from 0.87 (0.60) m s(-1) to 0.60 (0.36) m s(-1) (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absolute changes in contralateral PSV and EDV after CEA were larger among patients with a higher degree of stenosis preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes led to reclassification of stenosis to a lesser degree in 24 (55%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases (36%), this resulted in a measured stenosis on the contralateral side of less than 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: One-third of the patients with duplex measurements consistent with bilateral significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> did not have a significant contralateral stenosis by duplex after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, additional postoperative duplex measurement is advisable before planning contralateral CEA </plain></SENT>
