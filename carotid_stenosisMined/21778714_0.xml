<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedural risk may vary with plaque characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at determining the impact of carotid plaque surface irregularity on the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Solid microembolic signals (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi>) during CAS for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were assessed by means of dual-frequency transcranial Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study endpoint was the number of solid <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> during CAS in 12 patients with irregular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> compared to 12 matched patients with smooth <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 438 solid <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative number of solid <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> was 329 in patients with irregular plaques and 109 in those with smooth plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of subjects in whom solid <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> were detected was higher in the irregular plaque group (11/12) than in the smooth plaque group (5/12) (p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of solid <z:chebi fb="28" ids="39005,39010">MES</z:chebi> per CAS procedure and per hour of CAS procedure were both higher in patients with irregular plaques than in those with smooth plaques (p = 0.008 and 0.015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque surface irregularity predicts solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during stenting of symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
