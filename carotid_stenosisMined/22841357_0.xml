<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischaemic symptoms should be performed within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This aim was accomplished only in 11% during the years 2007-2008 in the Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since then, special efforts have been made in order to shorten the delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find out how these changes affected the symptom-to-knife time (SKT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptomatic patients (n = 144) who had carotid endarterectomy (CEA, n = 145) in HUCH in 2010 were retrospectively analysed and the SKT was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the operations, 37% (n = 53) were performed within the recommended 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median SKT was 19 days (1-183) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who came to HUCH on an emergency basis (n = 80), 55% (n = 45) were operated within 2 weeks and their median SKT was 13 days (1-148) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The changes that were made in 2008-2009 have significantly shortened the delay in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, but the desired time frame of 2 weeks was reached far too seldom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greatest benefit from preventive CEA is achieved when patients are referred emergently to a clinic where neurologist, imaging resources and vascular surgeon are available </plain></SENT>
