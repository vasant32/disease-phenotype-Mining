<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current carotid imaging techniques rely on estimating plaque-related lumen narrowing but do not evaluate intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, a key mediator of plaque rupture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using combined (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography, we investigated the relation between <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related FDG uptake and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with a recent (median, 6.5 days; interquartile range, 4-8) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (≥50%) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FDG uptake was quantified as mean standardized uptake values (SUVs, g/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients were included (25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 6 retinal embolism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two percent (13 of 60) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence within 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FDG uptake in ipsilateral carotid plaque was greater in patients with early recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (mean SUV, 1.85 g/ml; standard deviation [SD], 0.44 vs 1.58 g/ml; SD, 0.32, p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On life-table analysis, 90-day recurrence rates with mean SUV greater than a 2.14 g/ml threshold were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.8-99.2) versus 22.9% (95% CI, 12.3-40.3) with SUV ≤2.14 g/ml (log-rank, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a Cox regression model including age and degree of stenosis (50-69% or ≥70%), mean plaque FDG uptake was the only independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.3-28.8; p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: In recently symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>-related FDG uptake was associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, independent of the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Plaque FDG-PET may identify patients at highest risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence, who may be selected for immediate revascularization or intensive medical treatment </plain></SENT>
