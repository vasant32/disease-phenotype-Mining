<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Implementation and increasing use of CT angiography provided better visualization of the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries system leading to an unexpected more frequent detection of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (UIAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concomitant presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is a potential cause of significant mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the possible higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture after carotid procedures and ischemic events after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair, the simultaneous presence of both lesions creates several therapeutic dilemmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We review the prevalence of UIAs in patients with carotid occlusive disease and management difficulties and the current treatment strategies for handling the concomitant presence of these life-threatening diseases </plain></SENT>
