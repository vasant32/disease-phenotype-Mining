<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The objective was to compare Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA) with Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS) in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: This study enrolled 285 patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> that underwent either to CAS or CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The primary end-points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The secondary end-points were restenosis and nerve injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Data emerged from the follow-up at 1,3,6,12,24 months that provided for clinical and EcocolorDoppler monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A separate analyse was performed evaluating the prediction of the Ultrasonographic appearance of the atheroma on the symptomatic nature of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of neurological symptomatology in the periprocedural period was higher in CAS than in CEA group (9% vs 3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We didn't report any case of periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results from the follow-up are: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 5% CAS vs 7% CEA; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 5% CAS vs 4% CEA; restenosis 3% CAS vs 6% CEA; nerve injury 0% CAS vs 1% CEA; mortality 0% CAS vs 1% CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: CEA is the gold standard for treatment of significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, although endovascular technique is emerging as a less invasive alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CAS has presented a less frequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, nerve injury and long-term mortality, but it showed an higher percentage of neurological events both in short and long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This last aspect is correlated with the plaque structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic study of the atheroma has become a defining moment in the choice of the therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
