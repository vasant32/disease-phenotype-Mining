<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the associations between carotid artery plaque ulceration and plaque characteristics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with ≥50% stenosis, as well as in those with a low degree of stenosis (0% to 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=346) with symptoms in the anterior circulation were evaluated with multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA) for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque, degree of stenosis, and plaque ulceration in the symptomatic carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaque volume and plaque component proportions of LR-NC, fibrous tissue, and calcification were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The associations between plaque ulceration and plaque characteristics were analyzed using logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaque was present in 185 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaque ulcerations were present in 38 (21%) patients, of which half had a low degree stenosis (0% to 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plaque volume was significantly larger in ulcerated plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, and degree of stenosis, LR-NC proportion was strongly associated with plaque ulceration (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.27), whereas calcification proportion was inversely associated with plaque ulceration (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.89) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These associations remained significant in patients with a low degree stenosis (0% to 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plaque volume, degree of stenosis, and LR-NC proportion evaluated noninvasively with MDCTA are associated with carotid artery plaque ulceration, even in patients with a low degree stenosis (0% to 49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plaque volume and composition analysis with MDCTA may identify rupture prone plaques and improve risk stratification in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
