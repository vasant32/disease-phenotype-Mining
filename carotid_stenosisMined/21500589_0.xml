<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2007, 63 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were treated with CEA in 36 cases (CEA group) and with CAS in 27 cases (CAS group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 42 males and 21 females with an average age of 67.5 years (range, 52-79 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The locations were the left side in 28 cases and the right side in 35 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was 60%-95% (mean, 79%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major clinical symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cranial CT showed old <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in 24 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> in 22 cases, and no obvious abnormal change in 17 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The encephalon, heart, and local complications were compared between 2 groups within 7 days after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CEA group, encephalon complications occurred in 3 cases (8.3%), heart complications in 2 cases (5.6%), and local complications in 5 cases (13.9%); while in CAS group, encephalon complications occurred in 8 cases (29.6%), heart complications in 1 case (3.7%), and local complications in 3 cases (11.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The encephalon complication ratio of CAS group was significantly higher than that of CEA group (chi2 = 4.855, P = 0.028); and there was no significant difference in other complications ratios between 2 groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEA is the first choice to treat carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
