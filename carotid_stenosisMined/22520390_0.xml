<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Implication of cellular immunity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> also seems clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to analyze the association among plasma <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, neurological clinical events, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunocytology of carotid plaques in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt;70% receiving surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt;70% receiving surgical treatment were studied; 58% had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the ipsilateral carotid territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations were determined by considering pathological values &gt;12.4 μmol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological (stable and unstable plaques) and immunohistochemical (macrophages, T lymphocytes, and active T lymphocytes counts) studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> prevalence was calculated in this population, as were the possible relationships between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> plasma concentrations, and the carotid plaque type and the cell types in it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship between this risk factor and the presence of a neurological event relating to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> prevalence was 43.5%, with a mean value of 11.8 μmol/L (median; range = 2-41.8 μmol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and the plaque's morphological characteristics, or between the cell types analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elevated concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> were not significantly higher in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study confirms high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> prevalence in patients with extracranial cerebrovascular disease, although no relationship between plaque complication phenomena and this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factor</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
