<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (sCS) have a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence following the first ischaemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Guidelines recommend that patients undergo carotid revascularization (CR), preferably within 2 weeks of the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence during hospitalization in patients who were admitted to the hospital with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic event and who underwent CR for recently sCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: As part of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany (QugSS2; Qualitätsgemeinschaft Schlaganfallversorgung in Schleswig-Holstein), over a 4.5-year period (starting 2007) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (N = 15 797) who were admitted to the hospital with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral ischaemic event were included and prospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 597 (3.8%) patients (mean age, 71 ± 10 years; 30% women) underwent a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and admission to hospitals was 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the mean hospitalization of 10 days, 30 patients (5%) suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence were higher, albeit non-significantly, in men compared with women (6% vs. 2.3%, respectively; P = 0.059), and in patients admitted with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with patients admitted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (6.1% vs. 2%, respectively; P = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence did not show any association with the other demographic and clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was 5% in patients with recently sCS who scheduled for CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CR should be performed immediately after presenting event to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
