<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This diagnostic modality in recent years become the only diagnostic tool prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine hemodynamic status in symptomatic and asymtomatic patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> prior to and after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 124 symptomatic and 94 asymptomatic patients who had underwent CEA at the Clinic for Cardiovasculare Disease "Dedinje" in Belgrade were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasonography examinations were performed one day before CEA and seven days after it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-dyastolic velocity (EDV), time-averaged maximum blood flow velocity (MV), resistance index (RI) and the blood flow volume (BFV) of the ipsilateral and the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was the only risk factor found significantly more frequent in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significantly more occluded contralateral ICAs in the group of symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in PSV, EDV, MV and BFV of the ipsilateral ICA after CEA and a significant decrease in PSV, EDV, MV and BFV of the contralateral ICA after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RI is the only hemodynamic parameter without significant changes after CEA in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparing the values of hemodynamic parameters after CEA between the group of symptomatic and the group of asymptomatic patients no significant differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The occlusion of the contralateral ICA is an important factor differentiating between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Successful surgery provides good recovery of cerebral hemodynamics in both symtomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
