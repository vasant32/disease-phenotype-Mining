<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Membrane filters are EPDs, which preserve ICA flow during CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, ICA flow arrest may occur with filter use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes the angiographic, clinical, and histopathologic features of the filter occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients with cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> treated by CAS by using a single type of filter device were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were on dual antiplatelet treatment and fully heparinized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prestent dilation was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poststent dilation was performed in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control angiograms were obtained and evaluated after each step of the CAS procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> filters were inspected for debris, and if present, histology was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAS was successfully performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with &lt;20% residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Filter occlusion occurred in 6 patients (9.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It developed immediately after stent deployment in 4, and after a second prestent dilation in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five of the 6 had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, filter withdrawal led to immediate and complete restoration of ICA flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic M1 occlusion occurred immediately after filter withdrawal but was successfully treated with thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of filter-occlusion group had permanent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Gross and microscopic examinations demonstrated that the pores of the filters were occluded mainly by fibrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Postoperative diffusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging revealed no difference between filter-occlusion and non-filter-occlusion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICA flow arrest due to filter occlusion during CAS is relatively common and occurs more frequently in severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It resolves rapidly after filter removal and does not appear to worsen outcome </plain></SENT>
