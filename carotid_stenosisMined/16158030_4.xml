<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n=1,101) with asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> greater than 50% in relation to the bulb diameter were followed up for a period of 6 to 84 (median 38) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was graded using duplex scanning and expressed as a percentage of the carotid bulb diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and biochemical risk factors were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The end-points were ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a Cox multivariate analysis 6 factors emerged as independent predictors of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, male gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> on electrocardiogram (ECG) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> on ECG were associated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet therapy was associated with decreased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these risk factors a high-risk group consisting of one third of the population with a 40% cumulative cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate and a 66% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 7 years could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2/3 consisted of a low-risk group with a 10% cumulative cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate and a 21% <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 7 years (P&lt;0.0001 compared to the high risk group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was not any significant difference in the cumulative ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate, which was 12% in the low and 13% in the high cardiovascular risk group (Log Rank P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The methodology and findings from the ACSRS natural history study need to be applied to randomized controlled trials on the value of carotid endarterectomy or stenting in patients with asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They may help refine the indications for intervention in patients with carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
