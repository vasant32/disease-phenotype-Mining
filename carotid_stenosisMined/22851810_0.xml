<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, the snoring component itself has been independently linked to the presence of carotid atheroma, via local arterial trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify whether a snoring history is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in individuals presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants in the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) were asked about their snoring history as part of an entry questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 561 individuals with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, who had both a complete snoring questionnaire and carotid imaging, the relationship between presence and severity of snoring and the degree of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in both the symptomatic (culprit) and asymptomatic (non-culprit) sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 561 participants (287 male, mean/SD age = 73.3/11.0 years), 90 (16.0%) had ≥ 50% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and 154 (27.5%) snored frequently (≥ 1-2 times/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant associations were identified between frequency of self-reported snoring, and the degree of culprit and non-culprit carotid vessel stenosis, or plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No significant association could be identified between a history of frequent snoring and the presence of carotid atheroma, degree of stenosis, or plaque type </plain></SENT>
