<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the cerebrovascular risk stratification potential of baseline degree of stenosis, clinical features, and ultrasonic plaque characteristics in patients with asymptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients undergoing medical intervention for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hazard ratios for ICA stenosis, clinical features, and plaque texture features associated with ipsilateral cerebrovascular or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ischemic (CORI) events were calculated using proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1121 patients with 50% to 99% asymptomatic ICA stenosis in relation to the bulb (European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST] method) were followed-up for 6 to 96 months (mean, 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 130 ipsilateral CORI events occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of stenosis, age, systolic blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>increased serum creatinine</z:hpo>, smoking history of more than 10 pack-years, history of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, low grayscale median (GSM), increased plaque area, plaque types 1, 2, and 3, and the presence of discrete white areas (DWAs) without acoustic shadowing were associated with increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for predicted risk versus observed CORI events as a measure of model validity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The areas under the ROC curves for a model of stenosis alone, a model of stenosis combined with clinical features and a model of stenosis combined with clinical, and plaque features were 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-0.64), 0.66 (0.62-0.72), and 0.82 (0.78-0.86), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the last model, stenosis, history of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, GSM, plaque area, and DWAs were independent predictors of ipsilateral CORI events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combinations of these could stratify patients into different levels of risk for ipsilateral CORI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with predicted risk close to observed risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 923 patients with ≥ 70% stenosis, the predicted cumulative 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was &lt;5% in 495, 5% to 9.9% in 202, 10% to 19.9% in 142, and ≥ 20% in 84 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebrovascular risk stratification is possible using a combination of clinical and ultrasonic plaque features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings need to be validated in additional prospective studies of patients receiving optimal medical intervention alone </plain></SENT>
