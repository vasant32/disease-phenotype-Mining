<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is evidence for vascular comorbidity in several types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that neurovascular workup would detect a high degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> in patients with MCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In cooperation with our memory clinic, patients with amnestic MCI were referred to our department for neurovascular investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The workup encompassed ultrasound examination with carotid duplex including Intima-Media-Thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) measurement, and transcranial Doppler (TCD) including one-hour microemboli monitoring, cerebrovascular reactivity measurement and Bubble test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI for the evaluation of vascular and white-matter lesions, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, hippocampal volumes, and amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were present in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, three classified as mild, and one as moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> &gt; 1 mm was found in two patients, with a maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of 1.11 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with acceptable bone window had intracranial stenosis in TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Vasoreactivity was pathologically low in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Permanent right-left shunt was found in three patients, of which one showed spontaneous cerebral microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal volume reduction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> were found in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> ischemic changes in MRI were present in one patient, and three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751014" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarctions, microbleeds, or amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pure amnestic MCI is probably less associated with cerebrovascular disease and may be more consistent with evolving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, vascular risk factors are common in these patients </plain></SENT>
