<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Duplex ultrasound with Doppler velocimetry is widely used to evaluate the presence and severity of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>; however, a variety of velocity criteria are currently being applied to classify stenosis severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to compare published Doppler velocity measurements to the severity of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> as assessed by x-ray angiography in order to clarify the relationship between these 2 widely used approaches to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Scatter diagrams or "scattergrams" of correlations between Doppler velocity measurements and stenosis severity as assessed by x-ray contrast angiography were obtained from published articles for native and stented internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scattergrams were graphically digitized, combined, and segmented into categories bounded by 50% and 70% diameter reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were combined and divided into 3 sets representing different velocity parameters: (1) peak systolic velocity, (2) end-diastolic velocity, and (3) the internal carotid artery to common carotid artery peak systolic velocity ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The horizontal axis of each scattergram was transformed to form a cumulative distribution function, and thresholds were established for the stenosis categories to assess data variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen publications with 22 data sets were identified and included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wide variability was apparent between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 velocity parameters and angiographic percent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optimal peak systolic velocity thresholds for stenosis in stented carotid arteries were higher than those for native carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within each category of stenosis, the variability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 velocity parameters was significantly lower in stented arteries than in native arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although Doppler velocity criteria have been successfully used to classify the severity of stenosis in both native and stented carotid arteries, the relationship to angiographic stenosis contains significant variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This analysis of published studies suggests that further refinements in Doppler velocity criteria will not lead to improved correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> as demonstrated by angiography </plain></SENT>
