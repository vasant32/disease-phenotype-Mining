<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 292) undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mortality and cardiovascular ischemic events were recorded during a median follow-up of 5.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline plasma concentrations of adiponectin were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression models stratified for gender were used for estimation of risk of events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two patients died and 73 had an ischemic event (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, n = 52 and/or MI, n = 28) during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, adiponectin was associated with mortality, hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation (SD) increase of adiponectin, 1.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-1.86) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis age, type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD), plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and plasma adiponectin (HR per SD increase of adiponectin, 1.73 [95% CI, 1.29-2.32]) were independently associated with mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T2DM, CHD, fibrinogen, contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, systolic blood pressure, symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were independently associated with ischemic events, whereas plasma adiponectin was not (HR per SD increase of adiponectin, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75-1.23]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High plasma adiponectin concentration is associated with mortality in patients with established <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> undergoing surgery for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies to determine the role for adiponectin as a biomarker are warranted </plain></SENT>
