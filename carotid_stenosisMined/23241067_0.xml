<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated inflammatory markers in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), leukocyte count, leukocyte subgroups, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>50Â years) with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> detected by color Doppler ultrasonography, and 22 individuals without atherosclerotic findings on Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hs-CRP was associated with moderate to severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, but it did not differentiate symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
