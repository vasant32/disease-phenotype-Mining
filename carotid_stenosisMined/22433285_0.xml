<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: White matter lesions (WML) are commonly seen on brain MRI and are generally considered a marker of tissue damage from cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WML are associated with increasing age and vascular risk factors, but their precise cause is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A role for carotid artery atherothromboemboli has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If this is the case, more WML would be expected ipsilateral to increasing degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from two large, separate prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies, assessed with brain MRI and carotid Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We scored hemispheric WML visually in periventricular and deep locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> asymmetry and WML asymmetry, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, we assessed the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and ipsilateral WML, before and after adjusting for vascular risk factors, and tested associations between ipsilateral and contralateral stenoses and WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We recruited 247 (Study 1) and 253 (Study 2) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Study 1 and Study 2, 36 (15%) and 29 (11%) patients had ≥50% <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and 27 (11%) and 15 (6%) had ≥70% stenosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>Carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was asymmetric in 28 (11%) and 26 (10%) patients and WML were asymmetric in 22 (9%) and 11 (4%) patients in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and ipsilateral WML score, before or after adjusting for vascular risk factors or sidedness, but WML were strongly associated with increasing age (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In two large cohorts of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we found no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and ipsi- or contralateral WML </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is now substantial evidence that atherothromboemboli are unlikely to cause most WML or other forms of cerebral small vessel lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on determining what causes the intrinsic small vessel pathological changes that appear to underlie most WML </plain></SENT>
