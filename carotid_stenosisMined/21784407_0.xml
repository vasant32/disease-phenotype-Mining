<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the change in the treatment plan observed when clinical decisions are made based on initial carotid duplex ultrasonography (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>) performed at an outside center before surgical consultation versus those made based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> performed in a dedicated vascular laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study of patients who underwent initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> at an outside facility and repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> in a dedicated vascular laboratory for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> was compared with repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> to evaluate clinical impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-six consecutive patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disagreement between initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> and repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> was observed in 27.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This disagreement led to a change of treatment plan in 23 of 146 (15.8%) carotid arteries studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reliance on 1 DU in clinical practice, when performed outside a dedicated vascular laboratory, may lead to both unnecessary surgery and missed opportunities for surgery to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
