<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a simple and clinically relevant mouse model of arterial intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal left carotid artery (LCA) stenosis was created by placing 9-0 nylon suture around the artery using an external 35-gauge mandrel needle (middle or distal location), which was then removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of adjunctive diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flowmetry, wall strain analyses, biomicroscopy, and histology were completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LCA blood flow sharply decreased by ∼85%, followed by a responsive right carotid artery increase of ∼71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Circumferential strain decreased by ∼2.1% proximal to the stenosis in both dietary groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 28 days, morphologic adaptations included proximal LCA intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, which was exacerbated by diet-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proximal and distal LCA underwent outward and negative inward remodeling, respectively, in the mid-focal stenosis (remodeling indexes, 1.10 and 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A simple, defined common carotid focal stenosis yields reproducible murine intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and substantial differentials in arterial wall adaptations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This model offers a tool for investigating mechanisms of hemodynamically driven intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and arterial wall remodeling </plain></SENT>
