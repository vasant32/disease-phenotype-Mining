<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid plaque characteristics influence future risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the severity of stenosis does not accurately reflect plaque burden in patients with expansive arterial remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic outcome of symptomatic carotid low-grade stenosis with vulnerable plaque based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 25 (male, n = 23; age, 74.2 ± 5.6 years) of 29 consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid low-grade stenosis (&lt;50%) and both high-signal plaque and expansive remodeling on T1-weighted MRIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 4 were excluded because of impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single antithrombotic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> were administered, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was treated with dual antithrombotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We considered carotid endarterectomy when recurrence was refractory to aggressive medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 31.3 ± 16.4-month follow-up, 11 of the 25 patients developed a total of 30 recurrent ischemic events (46.0% per patient-year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients' characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups with and without recurrence (n = 11 and n = 14, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of 11 patients in the recurrence group treated with carotid endarterectomy remained free of ischemic events during a postoperative follow-up of 19.1 ± 14.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> with vulnerable plaque confirmed by MRI was associated with a high rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence that was refractory to aggressive medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, carotid endarterectomy was safe and effective for such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Plaque characterization by MRI has the potential for more accurate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk stratification in the management of carotid low-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
