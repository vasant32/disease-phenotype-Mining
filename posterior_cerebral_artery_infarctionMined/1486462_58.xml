<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with dominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e> in whom reading was unaffected served as an anatomical control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> readers had lesions in the medial and ventral occipital lobe, sparing dorsal white matter pathways and the ventral temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global and permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0010523'>alexia</z:hpo> occurred only with additional injury to the splenium, forceps major or white matter above the occipital horn of the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that callosal pathways mediating reading lie above the occipital horn and have little connection with the ventromedial occipital region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with 'spelling <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo>' had large lesions of the ventral temporal lobe involving cortical regions believed to participate in later stages of visual processing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings provide a framework for the prediction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> type and severity based on lesion topography </plain></SENT>
