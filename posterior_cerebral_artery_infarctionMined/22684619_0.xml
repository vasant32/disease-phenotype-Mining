<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report a reduction in macular ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness detected with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with homonymous hemianopia following acquired cerebral damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed case reports of three patients with unilateral posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients (aged 66, 68, and 71 years) with left homonymous hemianopia due to infarction of the right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory were studied using SD-OCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The duration of the lesions from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranged from 12 to 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer defects were not detected on funduscopy, GCC thinning was demonstrated in the hemiretinae corresponding to the affected hemifields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macular GCC measurements showed the localized defects of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells (RGCs) more clearly than circumpapillary <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> nerve fiber layer measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total and outer <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> thicknesses were not found to be significantly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that degeneration of RGCs can occur within a few years after <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
