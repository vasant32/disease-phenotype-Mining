<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the major cerebral arteries results in ischaemic changes to the brain, without time for reperfusion by the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subsequent cellular events lead to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, causing malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> manifested clinically by a rapid neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the value of surgical decompression in patients who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with deteriorating consciousness level from massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, treated by decompressive craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTSThere were 10 patients over a 2-year period from 1997-99, consisting of seven male and three female patients (mean age 47.56 years) with a mean preoperative Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) score of 6/15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had dominant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction, four had nondominant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, and the remaining two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up period of 7 months, two patients had died (20% mortality), four patients (40%) were vegetative or severely disabled, and the remaining four patients (40%) had mild disability or good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Favorable prognostic factors were younger age (less than 50 years) and good initial GCS score (14 or better) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decompressive craniectomy in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is a life-saving procedure and should be considered in younger patients who have a rapidly deteriorating neurologic status </plain></SENT>
