<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four patients with hemianopia from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e> were tested for residual unconscious vision ('blindsight') in their anopic hemifield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One task tested for spatial summation between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the abnormal hemifields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second task tested for temporal interactions between the two hemifields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third task required a manual localization of the site of a brief flash in the hemianopic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last test was administered either in a condition of free gaze during pointing or in a condition in which the gaze was kept fixed throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> phases of the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first two tasks differed from the third not only in the type of visual function, that is, detection vs spatial localization, but also in the response criterion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A forced-choice procedure was adopted in the localization task while in the spatial and temporal interfield interaction tasks a reaction time paradigm that did not require guessing was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient showed unequivocal evidence of blindsight on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tasks, thus excluding the possibility that his blindsight depended on the nature of the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An interesting dissociation was found in the localization task where 1 patient showed evidence of blindsight when tested under conditions of unrestrained gaze during pointing but not when tested under fixed gaze conditions </plain></SENT>
