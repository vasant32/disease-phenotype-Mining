<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Atherosclerotic stenosis of the vertebrobasilar system most commonly occurs at the vertebral artery origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenting of these stenotic lesions in combination with antithrombotics with or without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> is a safe and effective treatment method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to present the results of vertebral artery origin stenting in 14 high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Significant vertebral artery origin stenosis was treated with primary stenting in 14 patients, aged between 58 and 74 years (mean, 66+/-5.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were male, and three were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was detected in eight patients prior to coronary artery surgery, and in six patients after a posterior system <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or during evaluation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stenosis were successfully treated with stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except one patient who had a left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had an uneventful procedure without any complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Third-month and sixth-month clinical and color Doppler follow-up examinations were available in ten patients, and 12th-month control angiography performed in three patients did not show stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had new neurologic deficit during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Vertebral artery origin stenoses are one of the most common causes of vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the presence of concomitant cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or systemic disorders, patients are under high risk even if they are on medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Primary stenting combined with medical treatment is a safe and effective treatment modality </plain></SENT>
