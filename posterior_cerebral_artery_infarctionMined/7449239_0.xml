<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> infarction, the tentorial confluence sign was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, but a hockey stick pattern was seen in only half of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal accumulations may be classified into three types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These three types seem to be consistent with the territory of the blood supply from the cortical, temporal, and/or occipital branches of the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
