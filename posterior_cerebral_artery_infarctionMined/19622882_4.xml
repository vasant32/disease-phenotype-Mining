<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> has been shown to be the leading <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) territory infarction, intrinsic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> atherosclerotic disease may play a more important role in regions where intracranial diseases are prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the etiologies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pattern of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory infarction in a Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We reviewed consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory infarction who underwent diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) within 7 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 205 patients (male 56%, mean age 65.4 +/- 12.4 years) were recruited. 'Superficial', 'deep' and 'superficial plus deep' <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> accounted for 26.3, 47.8 and 25.9% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 126 patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> limited to the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory, whereas 79 patients had concomitant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in other territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 87 patients with LAA, 38 had intrinsic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> disease without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the proximal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms included atheromatous branch occlusion (n = 19), in situ thrombotic occlusion (n = 11) and artery-to-artery embolism (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While the occipital area was the most frequently involved in general, the ventrolateral thalamic area was more frequently involved than the occipital area in patients with intrinsic <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The patterns of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory infarction are different according to underlying etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our population, intrinsic atherosclerotic disease is a relatively important cause of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territory infarction that produces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> through a variety of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
