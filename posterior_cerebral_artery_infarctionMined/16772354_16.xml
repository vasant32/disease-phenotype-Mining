<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were screened for the presence of neglect on a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extra tests of visual perception were also carried out on six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish which areas were critically associated with neglect, the lesions of patients with and without neglect were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neglect of varying severity was documented in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, higher-order visual perception was impaired in 5 of the 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neglect was critically associated with damage to an area of white matter in the occipital lobe corresponding to a white matter tract connecting the parahippocampal gyrus with the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions of the thalamus or splenium of the corpus callosum did not appear necessary or sufficient to cause neglect, but may mediate its severity in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can result in visual neglect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interruption of the white matter fibres connecting the parahippocampal gyrus to the angular gyrus may be important in determining whether a patient will manifest neglect </plain></SENT>
