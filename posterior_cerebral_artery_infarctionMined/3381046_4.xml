<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were in addition a right homonymous hemianopsia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> for colors, objects and pictures, with both associative and disconnective aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of an occipito-occipital disconnection, depriving the left visual associative areas of inputs, could explain this <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most striking findings in this case was, besides an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003113" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anomia</z:e> for faces, a peculiar difficulty to recognize her own face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient seemed to recognize herself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient spoke about herself in the third person, giving genuine autobiographical details, without being able to say: "it is me" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is discussed in terms of disconnection: the right hemisphere sending information from the semantic field evoked by her own face, through the anterior part of the corpus callosum, to the left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss the hemispheric contribution within cognitive experience, and the role of language concerning the conscious experience in man </plain></SENT>
