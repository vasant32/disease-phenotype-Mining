<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 17 children had left middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarctions, five had right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions, two had bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarctions, and one had a left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 17 children developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> as neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of these children who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were neurologically abnormal as neonates, became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free and neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> early in the first year of life, and their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> therapies were discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free period of one to eight years, three of the 14 patients again required <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most children with neonatally diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> appear to have a good short-term outcome, but later <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and subsequent recognition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> may not be uncommon </plain></SENT>
