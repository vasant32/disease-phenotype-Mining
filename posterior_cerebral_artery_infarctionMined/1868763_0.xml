<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that the main clinical feature of PCAI was visual defect with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e> syndrome, the lesion was predominant in the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In examining the structure and function of brain and vessels, each of CT, MRI, ECT and DSA had its own advantage and might complement the others, CT and MRI were better in displaying the structure of cerebral parenchyma than ECT and DSA, whereas, MRI was superior in distinguishing the lesions in deep white matter and subtentorial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DSA was better than MRI and CT in displaying vascular structure, but was inferior in disclosing the occlusion of deep perforating branches or cortical arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ECT, besides its ability to show the morphological changes of brain, was mainly used to disclose the functional changes of cerebral parenchyma, being a method to make early diagnosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, ECT was inferior than MRI and CT, in displaying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesions of brain</z:e>-stem </plain></SENT>
