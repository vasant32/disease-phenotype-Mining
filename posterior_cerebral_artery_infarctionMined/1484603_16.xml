<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imagery of faces, letters, and topological relationships was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The impairment of imagery of object colours was associated with colour <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> and colour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003113" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anomia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For colours, there was no difference between performance on tasks calling for imagery of object colours and tasks affording a distinction between correctly and incorrectly coloured objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For shapes of objects, imagery appeared to be below the level of the patient's knowledge about the visual appearance of objects as manifested by the ability to identify objects and to distinguish correctly from incorrectly drawn pictures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apparently selective image generation deficit for shapes of objects could be a sequel of loss of knowledge about visual attributes of objects, if superior performance on shape recognition tasks was afforded by perceptual entry level representation which enable a rapid identification of objects but are inaccessible to introspective consciousness </plain></SENT>
