<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An important role for emotion in decision-making has recently been highlighted by disruptions in problem solving abilities after lesion to the frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such complex decision-making skills appear to be based on a class of memory ability (emotion-based learning) that may be anatomically independent of hippocampally mediated episodic memory systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have long been reports of intact emotion-based learning in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">amnesia</z:e>, arguably dating back to the classic report of Claparede </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such accounts relate to relatively simple patterns of emotional valence learning, rather than the more complex contingency patterns of emotional experience, which characterise everyday life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A patient, SL, who had a profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233795" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anterograde amnesia</z:e> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752132" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior cerebral artery infarction</z:e>, performed a measure of complex emotion-based learning (the Iowa Gambling Task) on three separate occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite his severe episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo>, he showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of performance on the Gambling Task, at levels comparable or better than controls-including learning that persisted across substantial periods of time (weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, emotion-based learning systems appear able to encode, and sustain, more sophisticated patterns of valence learning than have previously been reported </plain></SENT>
