<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the locus or loci that might induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> after a <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-one patients with unilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> infarctions involving only the occipital lobe or the occipital lobe plus other <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> areas were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects received a mini-mental status examination (MMSE) within 2 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; 43.9% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was not associated with left hemisphere lesion location, sex, age, education level, or the time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the MMSE assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only the lesion volume was negatively correlated with MMSE score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesion location analysis revealed that an occipital plus splenial or parahippocampal lesion contributed to a decline in MMSE, which suggests that parahippocampal or splenial involvement with an occipital lesion is associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> seen after <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
