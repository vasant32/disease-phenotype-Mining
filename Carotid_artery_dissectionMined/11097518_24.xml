<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> has been extensively studied and well-described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there has been a recent increase in the number of reported cases of vertebral artery (VA) dissection, the clinical variety of presentation and the early warning symptoms have not been well-described before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objectives in this study include: (1) To determine the early symptoms and warning signs which may help the clinician in the early identification and treatment of patients with VA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) To explore the variety of clinical presentation of VA dissection and its relation to prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis of hospital records in a tertiary academic centre for the period 1989-1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were identified (13 men and 13 women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 48 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible precipitating factors were identified in 14 patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sporting activity and chiropractic manipulations were the most common (15% and 11% respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> and/or neck pain was the prominent feature in 88% of patients and was a warning sign in 53%, preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by up to 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical features included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> (57%), unilateral facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> (46%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>cerebellar signs</z:hpo> (33%), lateral medullary signs (26%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bilateral VA dissection presented in six patients (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most common region of dissection was the C1-C2 level (16 arteries, 51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intracranial VA dissection was found in eight arteries (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (83%) had favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Poor prognosis was associated with (1) bilateral dissection; (2) intracranial VA dissection accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Only two patients reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that VA dissection affects mainly middle age persons and involves both sexes equally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> and/or neck pain followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> or unilateral facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> is an important warning sign that may precede <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although the majority of patients will have excellent prognosis, this was less likely in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> or bilateral VA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rate was low </plain></SENT>
