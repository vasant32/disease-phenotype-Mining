<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is based on the Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Artery Dissection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> Patients population comprising 983 consecutive CeAD patients and 658 control patients with a non-CeAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS), frequency-matched for age and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three age categories: ≤33 (for CeAD, n = 150), 34-54 (n = 688), and ≥55 (n = 145) years, and the youngest and oldest groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The youngest patients were mostly women and the oldest men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (ICAD) versus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) increased with age from 44 to 75 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This age-related shift remained significant after adjustment for sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a transient ischemic event as the CeAD symptom declined from 33 % in the youngest age group, to 19 % in the oldest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors increased in frequency with advancing age in both groups, but for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> the increase was steeper for non-CeAD IS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For CeAD patients, but not for patients with non-CeAD IS, preceding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was more common in the oldest group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The youngest non-CeAD IS patients had better functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) than the oldest, while the similar trend was not statistically significant among CeAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Younger age seems to be associated with VAD and female gender, and older age with ICAD and male gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Age-related changes in the frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were different between the CeAD and non-CeAD IS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age does not seem to be an important outcome predictor in CeAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
