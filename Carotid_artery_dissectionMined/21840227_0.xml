<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory markers were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imaging demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo> (n = 10), fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 6), arterial wall thickening (n = 2), and <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was available in 13 patients (median, 25 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptoms improved (n = 4), resolved (n = 3), or remained stable (n = 2), and four patients experienced new symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging, available in 10 patients at a median of 33 months, demonstrated new dissections, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> in five patients, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in three </plain></SENT>
