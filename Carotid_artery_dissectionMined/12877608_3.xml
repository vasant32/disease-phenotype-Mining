<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe an extension of type B dissection into type A during endoluminal treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection underwent endovascular repair using 2 Excluder stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before releasing the second stent-graft, the patient complained of mild central <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and visual flashes, but no hemodynamic changes were noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An angiogram, performed soon afterwards, showed a retrograde extension of the dissection through the aortic arch involving both the left carotid artery and the ascending aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The procedure was completed, and the patient was transported to the operating room where the proximal ascending aorta was replaced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spiral computed tomographic angiography performed 2 weeks after the procedure showed complete exclusion of the primary entry tear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 6-month follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic; the left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> had disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> type B dissection is technically feasible, but longer experience will help prevent technical complications </plain></SENT>
