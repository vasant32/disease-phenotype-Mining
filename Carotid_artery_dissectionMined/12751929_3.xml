<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of emergent carotid stenting for an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old man was admitted to our emergency department's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit 1 hour after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic and transcranial Doppler scans showed no pathological findings, but the color Doppler study detected a double lumen in the right carotid bifurcation extending to the proximal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the first 2 hours after admission, the patient's neurological status began to fluctuate; the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and Rankin scores evaluated each hour after admission ranged from 0 to 12 and from 0 to 3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Emergency carotid angiography confirmed the dissection of the bulb and proximal right ICA, which prompted implantation of 2 Wallstents from the internal to common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight hours later, the patient was almost totally asymptomatic with an NIHSS score of 1 and a Rankin score of 0; he was discharged on postoperative day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, the patient was free of neurological symptoms and the stented carotid artery was patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with fluctuating neurological signs and symptoms consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> that are refractory to medical therapy, a stent can be placed to prevent permanent neurological deficits provided that the anatomical conditions are suitable </plain></SENT>
