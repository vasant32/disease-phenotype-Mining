<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow changes in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the operated carotid artery were compared with clinical, paraclinical and operative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients were included in the study, 34 with symptomatic carotid artery lesions and 28 with very severe, progressive but asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (9 with symptomatic and 4 with asymptomatic lesions) suffered one or more neurological events during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood flow velocities were studied at different stages during surgery and compared between the two groups-symptomatic and asymptomatic-to try and assess the mean systolic velocities predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three events occurred during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, 7 at clamping, 3 during clamping; 9 shunts were installed, one of which at the twelfth minute of clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A shunt was not installed in 4 cases: two events occurred at the end of the operation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>), one event occurred during an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, another at clamping which resulted in aborting the operation as transluminal pulsed Doppler suggested an embolism during dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two events were attributed to an embolic phenomenon and 16 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Peroperative middle cerebral arterial flow recording enables detection of an embolism, monitoring of a shunt and the prediction of a neurological event should the mean systolic velocities fall to less than 15 cm/s and the reduction in velocity attain 70% (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 91%) </plain></SENT>
