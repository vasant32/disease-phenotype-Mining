<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He received modern burn therapy, including early d√©bridment and skin grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient discharged 70 days after being burned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, he sustained an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> 7 days after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed left middle cerebral artery territory infarction, and a magnetic resonance angiogram showed nonvisualization of left distal intra-cranial carotid artery and proximal middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thickened walls of these arteries indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient received a follow-up magnetic resonance angiogram study 10 years later to check cerebral vascular lesions that may not have been apparent on the original image studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It showed only persistently thickened left distal intra-cranial carotid artery and middle cerebral artery walls, indicative of old dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> must be considered as one cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in pediatric burn patient, even in the recovery phase of burn injury </plain></SENT>
