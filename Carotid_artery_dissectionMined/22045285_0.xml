<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsies are commonly attributed to microvascular disease or compressive lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, but may rarely be associated with ischemic large vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of an extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection heralded by CN III palsy with review of the relevant literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old right-handed man presented with right-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> 2 days earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following day, the family noted his left eye to be deviated outward with enlarged pupil and droopy eyelid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the day of admission, he had a fall owing to right-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His neurological examination revealed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">third nerve palsy</z:e>, right homonymous hemianopsia, and right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> with hemisensory deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A brain magnetic resonance image showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the left middle cerebral artery distribution without mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiogram showed a left extracranial internal cerebral artery (ICA) dissection with absence of flow within the distal cervical and intracranial ICA segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He underwent a decompressive left hemicraniectomy with partial improvement in his deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Oculomotor nerve palsy</z:e> as a result of ICA disease is a rare entity but has been reported in cases of stenosis, occlusion, and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely to be caused by hypoperfusion of CN III secondary to low flow or microembolism in the arteries feeding the nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of CN III palsy in patients with ICA disease is higher in the presence of a fetal posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oculomotor nerve palsies</z:e> with pupillary involvement warrant thorough investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When routine work-up fails to elucidate an etiology, extracranial carotid pathology should be considered </plain></SENT>
