<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential role of atrial natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (ANP) and brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) in the pathogenesis of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000127'>salt wasting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinical case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Regional pediatric intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 3-yr-old boy with a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> secondary to traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and excessive renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion on the sixth day after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Plasma concentrations of ANP, BNP, antidiuretic hormone, and renin were determined serially and compared with concentrations measured in a group of eight healthy children undergoing elective surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, ANP and BNP plasma concentrations on the eighth day after hospitalization were increased 1.9-fold and 7.7-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the course of ANP and BNP paralleled that of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> excretion and remained elevated until the 14th (BNP) and 16th (ANP) days after hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum antidiuretic hormone and renin concentrations were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges during the entire observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000127'>salt wasting</z:hpo> is associated with elevated plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> may play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
