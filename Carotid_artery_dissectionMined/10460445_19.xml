<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the clinical course and neuroradiological findings of ten patients aged 27-46 years, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD; n = 8) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (CAD; n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> following chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following observations were made: (a) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had uneventful medical histories, no or only mild vascular risk factors, and no predisposing vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(b) VAD was unilateral in five patients and bilateral in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VAD was located close to the atlantoaxial joint in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight patients and showed additional involvement of lower sections in six, as well as temporary occlusion of one vertebral artery in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(c) Nine of ten patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> documented by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(d) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was immediately after the manipulation (n = 5) or within 2 days (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(e) Progression of neurological deficits occurred within the following hours to a maximum of 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(f) Maximum neurological deficits were severe in nine of ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(g) Outcome after 4 weeks-3 years included no or mild neurological deficits in five patients, marked deficits in three, persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> in one, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(h) Informed consent was obtained in only one of ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after chiropractic manipulation may not be identified a priori </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits may be severely disabling and are potentially life threatening </plain></SENT>
