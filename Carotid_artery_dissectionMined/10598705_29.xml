<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1992 and 1998, seven patients underwent stenting procedures for treatment of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e> resulting from various causes, including trauma (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1512608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iatrogenesis</z:e> (n = 2), spontaneous development (n = 2), and fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stenting procedures were performed for large, nonhealing, dissection-induced pseudoaneurysms (four cases) or severe preocclusive stenosis (three cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 11 stents were placed (Palmaz stents, n = 8; Wallstents, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiological follow-up examinations were performed after a mean period of 17.7 months (range, 1-67 mo), using conventional or computed tomographic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up data were obtained after a mean period of 42.9 months (range, 13-72 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> stent placements resulted in complete resolution of dissection-induced stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For two of the four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, the lesions occluded spontaneously at the time of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The third patient required coil embolization of the pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient exhibited progressive shrinkage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in serial follow-up examinations, with healing after 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No clinical complications were associated with the procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient exhibited progression to asymptomatic occlusion 3 months after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients exhibited no significant changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained in clinically stable condition, with no ischemic symptoms, during more than 3.5 years (mean period) of follow-up monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This experience suggests that stents placed for treatment of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissections</z:e> remain patent and patients remain free of symptoms on a long-term basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Additional studies will be required to determine the optimal types of stents and intervals for follow-up monitoring using imaging </plain></SENT>
