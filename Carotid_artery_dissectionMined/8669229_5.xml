<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> in consecutive patients with ICA dissection and to describe clinical and radiological characteristics and their evolution over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted in 52 consecutive patients with dissection of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed clinical data of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> as complication of ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined ICA dissection as angiographic evidence of a string sign, double lumen, or internal flaps or visualization on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic scans of an enlarged arterial wall due to the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 52 consecutive patients with ICA dissection 7 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo>: 2 had an involvement of the Vth cranial nerve and 5 had lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients totally recovered while 2 did not after a 2 to 10-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> associated with ICA dissection is higher in our study than in those of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> due to ICA dissection without any ischemic event are probably not referred to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography is less sensitive than cervical MRI to detect such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>Cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> could either be due to compression by the enlarged ICA wall or an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the nerve </plain></SENT>
