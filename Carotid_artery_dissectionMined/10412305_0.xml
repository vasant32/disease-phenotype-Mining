<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A dissection is diagnosed in relation to minor often primarily unrecognized trauma to the neck and the typical clinical features seen with dissection are <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> and symptoms of focal brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment, i.e. anti-coagulant therapy, is initiated to avoid <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or recurrent embolism from the damaged arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognosis is generally good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of carotid dissection can be confirmed with ultrasound-duplex-scanning, conventional angiography or magnetic resonance imaging/angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper two cases are reported in which computed tomography (CT-scanning) with intravenous contrast enhancement has been a valuable diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of this entity </plain></SENT>
