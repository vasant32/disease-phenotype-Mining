<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the endovascular treatment of an iatrogenic common carotid artery (CCA) dissection using the superficial temporal artery (STA) as the principal access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: An 83-year-old man with a post-carotid endarterectomy left CCA dissection was admitted for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> involving the left cerebral hemisphere that occurred despite proper anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After excluding redo surgery and transfemoral stenting (owing to a partially compromised aortobifemoral bypass graft), stenting of the left CCA dissection was planned using a right transbrachial approach, with the left STA as an additional access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, intraoperative angiography showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> angle between the innominate artery and left CCA, so the STA was used as the primary access route owing to its straight course and 4-mm diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 9-x40-mm self-expanding stent was inserted via a 5-F sheath in the STA and deployed directly at the CCA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure was successful, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels involved were patent at 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In selected cases, the superficial temporal artery may represent a valid alternative approach for the endovascular treatment of short CCA dissections </plain></SENT>
