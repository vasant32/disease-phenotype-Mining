<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (CAD) accounts for 10-20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> in young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although trauma and preexisting disorders of the arterial wall are the main predisposing factors, most CADs are considered 'spontaneous' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that CAD could originate in systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> bound to the intima-media interface without clinical signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If this hypothesis is true, endothelium-dependent vasodilation would be impaired in response to a physiological stimulus such as an increase in blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Flow-mediated arterial dilation was studied in 65 consecutive patients with spontaneous CAD: 26 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (ICAD), and 39 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CAD patients with vascular risk factors, trivial or obvious cervical trauma, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of unknown cause were included as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution ultrasonography, brachial artery diameter was measured at rest, during post-ischemic hyperemia (flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilation), and after sublingual <z:chebi fb="2" ids="24364">glyceryl</z:chebi> trinitrate spray (endothelium-independent dilation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean +/- SD values of the flow-mediated vasodilation index were 5.7 +/- 6.2% in ICAD, 5.0 +/- 9.3% in VAD and 13.2 +/- 6.5% in controls (p &lt; 0.0005), without any difference between ICAD and VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endothelium-independent dilation mean values were 21.5 +/- 9.5% in ICAD, 25.1 +/- 12.5% in VAD, and 20.8 +/- 8.4% in controls, without a significant difference between groups (p = 0.49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results give evidence of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in CAD patients that is not the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and suggest that an underlying abnormality of the arterial wall layers may predispose to CAD </plain></SENT>
