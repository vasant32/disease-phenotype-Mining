<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review the clinical patterns in which ICA dissection may be identified in the setting of migrainous symptoms, given the different therapeutic approaches to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and dissection and the non-invasive means to diagnose dissection with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
