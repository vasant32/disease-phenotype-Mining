<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study 11 patients aged between 34 and 57 years with clinical and angiographic findings typical of carotid dissection were thoroughly examined with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) repeatedly during a follow-up period of 1-6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stagnating blood flow velocities in the downstream middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were recorded initially as well as enhanced velocities due to postischaemic hyperperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolism originating from the extracranial carotid artery with or without resolution could be detected by TCD in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD findings in another 2 cases pointed to haemodynamic upset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, clinical as well as TCD data did not allow strict differentiation between embolic and haemodynamic complications, suggesting more complex pathophysiological mechanisms as the cause of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid recanalization was seen in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The follow-up investigations moreover demonstrated that intracranial haemodynamics may change from day to day in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD data may thus improve the understanding of pathogenetics as well as rationales for individual therapeutic intervention in this particular disease </plain></SENT>
