<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of cervical pseudoaneurysm secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> causing symptomatic mass effect was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old woman presented with the complaint of right neck swelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> that was considered to be the mass effect of a pseudoaneurysm caused by dissection of the right common carotid artery (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although a self-expanding stent was deployed to cover the orifice of the pseudoaneurysm, the pseudoaneurysm had been enlarged because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation on the inner wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A microcatheter was guided through the stent mesh into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and Guglielmi detachable coils were placed to embolize the orifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One month later, angiography revealed complete embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> while preserving flow in the CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mass effect attributable to the pseudoaneurysm was relieved symptomatically as well as radiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid artery dissection</z:e> with symptomatic mass effect can be treated successfully, using a combination of stent and coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This method may be considered to be an alternative to conventional surgical treatment such as proximal ligation, extracranial-intracranial bypass, or direct surgical repair </plain></SENT>
