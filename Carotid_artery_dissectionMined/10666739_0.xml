<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hemicrania and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> followed by left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, carotid angiography revealed postsinus tapering occlusion of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, he was managed with conservative treatment, but his neurological status deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Findings of brain CT, MRI and <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT suggested hypoperfusion of the right cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Palmaz stent, 39 mm in length, was successfully placed over the site of the dissection to restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patency through the dissected carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following stent implantation, his neurological signs improved gradually but completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the procedure, with oral administration of antiplatelet medication, he has suffered no cerebral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up carotid angiography one year after stent implantation showed good patency of the stented segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present case emphasizes the usefulness of stenting for spontaneous cervical carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
