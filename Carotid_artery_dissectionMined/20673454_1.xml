<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 46-year-old male patient presented with a spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After failing conservative therapy, he was treated by endovascular placement of a Palmaz stent at level of the pseudoaneurysm and dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate obliteration of pseudoaneurysm was achieved, and patency of the internal carotid artery was maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient sustained no neurological complications and the stenosis of treated carotid artery did not occur during the 6-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e>, stent placement seems to be a reasonable therapeutic alternative to direct surgery </plain></SENT>
