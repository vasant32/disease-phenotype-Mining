<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To review the diffusion-weighted imaging characteristics of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> secondary to internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection and to gain further insights into the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients with ICA dissection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were identified by review of an angiographic database and hospital discharge codes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if the diagnosis of ICA dissection was confirmed and diffusion-weighted imaging was obtained within 10 days of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> patterns were analyzed according to established templates of vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was present in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was found in 10 (71%) of the 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical involvement was found in 8 patients, while the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was restricted to the subcortical region in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 (64%) of the 14 patients, ischemic lesions were located in 1 of the 3 border zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> pattern with border zone involvement is frequently found in ICA dissection-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding may further support an interaction of hemodynamic and embolic mechanisms as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in this condition </plain></SENT>
