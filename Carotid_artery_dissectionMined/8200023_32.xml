<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients (74%) complained of a cephalic pain which was inaugural in 38 (58.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was homolateral to the dissection in 79% of cases and lasted from 1 h to 30 days, with a median of 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signs of cerebral or <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> were observed in 79% of patients, often delayed and occurring up to 29 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> was present in 31% of patients, and was the only manifestation of dissection in 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation of the dissections and angiographic findings were similar in patients with and without pain except for a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> which was more frequent in patients with painful dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cephalic pain is frequent and often inaugural in carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its recognition is important for early diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
