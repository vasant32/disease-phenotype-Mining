<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Exposure of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) above the level of the second cervical vertebra can be difficult and often require maneuvers such as division of the digastric muscle or mandibular subluxation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques increase exposure but may not provide adequate access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a series of eight cases in which vertical division of the mandibular ramus provided access of the ICA up to the base of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over the last 10 years, eight patients underwent vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO) to aid in distal ICA exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative arteriography revealed ICA lesions within 1.5 cm of the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indications for surgery were compelling and included gunshot wounds to zone III of the neck (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n = 2), and preocclusive stenosis (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VRO was performed through a standard vertical neck incision and was created from the depth of the sigmoid notch to the angle of the mandible after elevating the masseter muscle from the bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Miniature <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> plates were used to reapproximate the mandible after endarterectomy (n = 5), bypass (n = 2), or arterial repair (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that VRO provides reliable exposure of the distal ICA up to the base of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike mandibular subluxation, it requires no pre-incision preparation, thus mandibulotomy can be performed after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> has begun, and may even be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VRO is especially useful when carotid artery pathology unexpectedly extends beyond the usual field of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Work on the carotid artery at the skull base is associated with significant complications and should be reserved for compelling indications </plain></SENT>
