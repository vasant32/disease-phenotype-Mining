<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Tertiary center (Comprehensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case series review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The data of 90 patients with head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> involving the carotid artery were operated for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> and/or resection, and reanastomosis in the last 10 years were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty (89%) of the 90 patients' head and neck <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two (65%) and 28 (35%) of 80 patients were recurrent and stage IV disease, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no stage I to III disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery was dissected and preserved in 64 (71.1%) of the 90 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (20%) of 90 patients needed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> with resection and reanastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight (8.9%) patients were unresectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty (75%) of 80 patients needed reconstruction with regional or free flaps and grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall 2- and 5-year estimated survivals were 32.4% and 27.8% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; 14.3% and 10.7% for recurrent; 64.3% and 57.8% for stage IV previously untreated; and 22.0% and 22.0% for carotid artery resected-reanastomosed patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> without resection is an achievable goal in majority of patients with the advanced stage head and neck <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> involving the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Resection and reanastomosis of carotid artery, especially in the previously untreated carotid involved patients, is a feasible surgery and achieves better survival and disease control rates when compared with the unresected or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
