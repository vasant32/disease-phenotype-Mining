<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional transsurface carotid ultrasonography (TSCU) via the cervical surface often fails to detect dissection of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU) in the detection of ICA dissection was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Patients with unilateral extracranial ICA dissection identified by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from our database of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings of dissection were compared between TSCU and TOCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (7 men, 37-69 years old), including 7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, had ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By DSA, dissection was identified between the first and third vertebrae in 4 patients and from the third cervical vertebra to the intracranial level in the remaining 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TOCU images revealed an intimal flap as definite evidence of dissection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients, color flow signals were not seen in false lumens, indicating thrombosed lumens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients showed morphological changes of dissection on follow-up TOCU, including a patient with recovery of color flow signals in false lumens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the dissected ICA was 7.3 ± 0.7 mm and that of the contralateral ICA was 4.9 ± 0.6 mm (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TSCU did not enable any conclusive findings of ICA dissection to be made in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients had intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> on T(1)-weighted MRI, and 2 had an intimal flap with a double lumen on magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TOCU has advantages over TSCU in achieving an accurate diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
