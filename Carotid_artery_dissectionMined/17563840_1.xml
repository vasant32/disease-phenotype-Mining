<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this relation, the characteristics of pain related to SCAD and changes in PH patterns after SCAD, we evaluated 54 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five (65%) had previous PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Painful SCAD occurred in 39 (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Frontal and parietal localizations were significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (p=0.013 and p=0.010, respectively), whereas occipital and nuchal pain, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (p=0.047 and p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous PH did not influence the presence of pain at SCAD <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (74%) patients with PH reported improvement in PH pattern after a mean follow-up of 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that mechanisms underlying PH do not modulate dissection-related pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disruption of perivascular afferents may be involved in improvement of PH patterns after SCAD </plain></SENT>
