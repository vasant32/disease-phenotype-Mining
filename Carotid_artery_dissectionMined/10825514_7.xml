<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> manifesting with ischemic symptoms were treated successfully with endovascular insertion of coils after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 42-year-old man with spontaneous dissection of the left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) presented with the major complaint of left neck swelling and pain that was considered to be the mass effect of a pseudoaneurysm caused by dissection of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy using a stent and coils was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The self-expanding stent was deployed to cover the neck of the pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A microcatheter was then guided through the stent mesh into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and coils were placed to pack it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four months later, angiography revealed complete embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with preserved flow in the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mass effect attributable to the pseudoaneurysm was relieved symptomatically as well as radiologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> with symptomatic mass effect++ can be treated successfully by the combination of stent and coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may be considered as an alternative to conventional proximal ligation, extracranial-intracranial bypass, or direct surgical repair </plain></SENT>
