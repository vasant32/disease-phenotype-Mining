<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rationale for aggressive screening will be discussed based on a consecutive case series of blunt traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients admitted to our level I trauma center developed severe complications as a consequence of blunt traumatic CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CAD was delayed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients until serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the current awareness that CAD can result from blunt trauma, this type of injury is often overlooked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological advances have considerably increased the knowledge of incidence and underlying mechanisms of traumatic CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This could have implications for case identification and the evaluation of treatment strategies in clinical trials in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening may increase the rate of early CAD diagnosis, but it is unclear if screening will also result in early detection of a treatable lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trials have to provide the answer to whether initiating therapy will lead to improvements in the outcome in traumatic CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore believe that screening is a basic condition for initiation of future clinical trials </plain></SENT>
