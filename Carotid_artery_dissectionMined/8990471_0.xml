<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with a spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previously healthy 24-year-old man was hospitalized because of a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and consciousness disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In reality, right cervical pain preceded this attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first brain MRI revealed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the right cerebral hemisphere including basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A conventional angiography was performed 1 week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The following angiographic picture was considered to be consistent with the diagnosis of cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e>: gradually tapered occlusion beginning distal to the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And MRA revealed the same finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cervical MRI revealed as an eccentric signal void (corresponding to the residual lumen) surrounded by a semilunar hyperintensity (corresponding to the mural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>) on T1- and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Dynamic CT scan (D-CT) revealed an eccentric and crescent contrast enhancement (corresponding to the residual lumen) surrounded by a relative hypodensity compared with muscle (corresponding to the mural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>), itself surrounded by a thin annular enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From these results, we diagnosed this patient with ICA occlusion for dissection of the extracranial carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>But we decided this case contraindication of anastomosis because he had had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that MRA, cervical MRI and DCT provide early recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and monitoring of its resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, these studies may guide clinical decisions according to the development of the dissection </plain></SENT>
