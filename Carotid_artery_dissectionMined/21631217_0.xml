<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> may occur spontaneously or after trauma and may present with a rapid neurological deterioration or with hemodynamic compromise and a delayed and unstable neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular intervention using stent angioplasty can be used as an alternative to anticoagulation and open surgical therapy in this setting to restore blood flow through the affected carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors present the cases of 2 patients with flow-limiting symptomatic ICAD leading to near-complete occlusion and without sufficient collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients had isolated cerebral hemispheres without significant blood flow from the anterior or posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the patients demonstrated blood pressure-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> unstable neurological deficits as a result of the hemodynamic compromise resulting from the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients underwent careful microwire-based selection of the true lumen followed by confirmatory microinjection and subsequent exchange-length microwire-based recanalization using tandem telescoping endovascular stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases the neurological state improved, and no permanent neurological deficit ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of ICAD may be difficult in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> unstable neurological deficits related to symptomatic hypoperfusion, especially in the setting of a hemodynamically isolated hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation alone may be insufficient in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although there is no widely accepted guideline for the treatment of ICAD, the authors recommend stent-mediated endovascular recanalization in cases of symptomatic flow-limiting hemodynamic compromise, especially in cases of an isolated hemisphere lacking sufficient communicating artery compensatory perfusion </plain></SENT>
