<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic analysis revealed the p.Gly556Arg mutation in exon 8 of the gene encoding glypican 3 (GPC3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the second case of a GPC3 missense mutation to be reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only risk factor found in this patient was carotid redundancy, a deformation that is significantly associated with spontaneous carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The natural history of SGBS in adults is poorly known, and this case raises the question of a possible vascular risk associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
