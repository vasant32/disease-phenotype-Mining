<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 45-year-old male with a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and an artificial graft replacement of the abdominal aorta due to AAD type B, 7 years ago, was brought into our hospital by ambulance 30 minutes after an attack of fainting and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, the patient complained not of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> or left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
