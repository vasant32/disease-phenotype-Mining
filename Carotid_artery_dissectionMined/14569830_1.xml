<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection (ICAD) may be extremely difficult to diagnose only on the basis of historical information and clinical signs, and even standard brain imaging (computed tomography [CT], T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may not be sufficient to delineate the underlying pathology clearly, as shown in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical presentation and parenchymal lesion pattern on CT were suggestive of inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating disease</z:e>, and additional multiparametric MRI was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, and perfusion-weighted MRI revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions, bilateral ICA obstruction, and bilateral hypoperfusion in the middle cerebral artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral ICAD was confirmed by Doppler and duplex ultrasound, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A follow-up examination showed recanalization of the obstructed ICAs and the normalization of cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of demonstrating the pathology and the value of multiparametric MRI techniques for the diagnosis and monitoring of ICAD and its hemodynamic consequences </plain></SENT>
