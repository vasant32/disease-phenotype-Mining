<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The yield of imaging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> has been explored only in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the yield of imaging in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> examined in 2 neuro-ophthalmology hospital clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the ability to determine the etiology at the time of the first neuro-ophthalmology consultation: group I, etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> known at the initial neuro-ophthalmologic examination; group II, etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> not known at the initial neuro-ophthalmologic examination, but sufficient information obtained to allow targeted imaging; and group III, etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> not known at the initial neuro-ophthalmologic examination, and sufficient information not obtained to allow targeted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The yield of investigation and the frequency of the different etiologies were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 32 (62%) patients, the etiology was already known at the initial neuro-ophthalmologic examination (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent etiology was surgical trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 11 (21%) patients, a targeted imaging workup was possible, revealing an etiology in 7 patients (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid dissection and cavernous sinus mass were the most common etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 9 (17%) patients, a nontargeted imaging evaluation was necessary, revealing an etiology in only 1 patient, who had a previously undetected thyroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> is usually known at the time of initial presentation to a neuro-ophthalmologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When the etiology is not known and clinical information permits a targeted imaging evaluation, an etiology can usually be determined, most commonly a cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> or a cavernous sinus mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the etiology is not known and clinical information is insufficient to allow a targeted imaging evaluation, an etiology is rarely discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even so, nontargeted imaging is warranted because life-threatening lesions, such as thyroid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, may rarely be detected </plain></SENT>
