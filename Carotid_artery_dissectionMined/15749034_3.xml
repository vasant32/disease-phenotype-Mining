<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Reviewing the charts of our hospital between 2000 and 2001, we found two consecutive patients who benefited from primary stenting for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> treatment of spontaneous extracranial internal CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Primary stenting of the internal carotid artery was successful in both cases without any post-operative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and US duplex scan follow-up confirmed the absence of neurological symptoms and the patency of the internal carotid artery with complete disappearance of the dissection at 36 and 42 months after the procedure, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the small number of patients, primary stenting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CAD seems to be safe and effective </plain></SENT>
