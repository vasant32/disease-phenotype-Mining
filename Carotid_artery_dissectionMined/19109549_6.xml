<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We set out to investigate the predictors and time course for recanalization of spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (SICAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively included 249 consecutive patients (mean age, 45+/-11 years) with 268 SICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound examinations were performed at presentation, during the first month, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months, and clinical follow-ups after 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 268 SICADs, 20 (7.5%) presented with &lt;or=50% stenosis, 31 (11.6%) with 51% to 80% stenosis, 92 (34.3%) with 81% to 99% stenosis, and 125 (46.6%) with an occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic treatment included anticoagulation in 174 (67%) patients, aspirin in 64 (24%) patients, and aspirin followed by anticoagulation or vice versa in 22 (8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ultrasound showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in 160 (60%), &lt;or=50% stenosis in 27 (10%), 51% to 80% stenosis in 4 (1%), 81% to 99% stenosis in 26 (10%), and occlusion in 51 (19%) vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of complete recanalization was 16% at 1 month, 50% at 3 months, and 60% at 6 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initial occlusion of the dissected vessels reduced the odds of recanalization (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.2-7.3; P&lt;0.001), whereas the occurrence of local symptoms and signs only at presentation were independently associated with complete recanalization (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; P=0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that recanalization of SICAD occurs mainly within the first 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial occlusion reduces the likelihood of complete recanalization, whereas presentation with local symptoms and signs only increases it </plain></SENT>
