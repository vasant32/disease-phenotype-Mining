<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied eight consecutive patients with clinical and intra-arterial angiographic (DSA) diagnosis of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection to analyse the accuracy of MRA in dissections, using a new technique with presaturation pulses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Spin-echo images of the head were followed by three-dimensional time-of-flight (TOF) MRA at the site of the dissection, with and without a special caudal saturation pulse in addition to the cranial one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of MRA was assessed in 64 segments of 16 ICA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined with DSA and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-signal intramural haematoma in the ICA at the level of the dissection was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients either on the maximal-intensity projection (MIP) reconstructions or on the partitions with this presaturation pulse technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRA had a sensitivity to detect dissected vessels of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specificity for vessels correctly identified as not having a lesion was also 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between DSA and MRA in demonstrating the site of the dissected ICA segment and the degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In only two cases was there overestimation of the degree of stenosis on the MIP reconstructions of the 3-D MRA </plain></SENT>
