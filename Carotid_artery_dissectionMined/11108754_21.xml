<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to characterize the subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy and the puerperium, with emphasis on timing, etiology, risk factors, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the Toronto Hospital between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1997, with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during pregnancy or within 6 weeks postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were classified as ischemic (arterial or venous) or hemorrhagic (subarachnoid or intracerebral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were investigated with at least a CT scan of the head, and most had MRI and/or cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of approximately 50 700 admissions for delivery, 34 patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified (21 infarctions and 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of patients with infarction, 13 were arterial and 8 were venous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 arterial events occurred in the third trimester or puerperium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of 8 venous occlusions occurred postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An etiologic diagnosis was made in 7 of 13 patients with arterial territory infarction, including cardiac emboli, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, 7 were subarachnoid and 6 were intracerebral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The etiology was identified in 10 patients: 3 were due to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 5 were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, and 2 were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with infarction survived, but 3 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> associated with pregnancy were <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most presented during the third trimester and puerperium </plain></SENT>
