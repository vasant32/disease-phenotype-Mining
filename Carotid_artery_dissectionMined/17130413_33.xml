<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Incidence rates for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> (ICAD) have been reported to be 2.6 to 2.9 per 100,000, but reliable epidemiologic data for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> (VAD) are not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence rate of cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (CAD) in a defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With IRB approval, we used the medical record linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with spontaneous ICAD and VAD for the period of 1987-2003 in Olmsted County, MN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 48 patients with CAD, there were 32 patients with ICAD and 18 patients with VAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Olmsted County, the average annual incidence rate for ICAD was 1.72 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 1.13 to 2.32) and for VAD 0.97 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 0.52 to 1.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average annual incidence rate for CAD was 2.6 per 100,000 population (95% CI, 1.86 to 3.33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently encountered symptoms in CAD were head or neck pain (80%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>) (56%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good outcome (defined as modified Rankin score of 0 to 2) was seen in 92% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of dissection was observed during a mean 7.8 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> was detected approximately twice as frequently as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> in the overall study, but in the latter half of the study period, vertebral artery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> incidence rates were equivalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> patients in the community have excellent outcome, and contrary to many tertiary referral series, re-dissection is rare </plain></SENT>
