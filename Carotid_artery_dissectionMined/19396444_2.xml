<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using cervical high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, three readers, blinded to the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, searched for PAE, defined as periarterial T2-hyperintensity and T1-hypointensity, in 29 consecutive CAD patients categorized as spontaneous CAD (sCAD, n = 18) or traumatic CAD (tCAD, n = 11; i.e., major head or neck trauma within 2 weeks before the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple CADs (n = 8) were found only in sCAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with tCAD, patients with sCAD were more likely to have a recent history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (OR = 12.5 [(95%)CI = 1.3-119], p = 0.03), PAE (83% vs. 27%; OR = 13.3 [(95%)CI = 2.2-82.0], p = 0.005) and to have elevated CRP (OR = 6.1 [(95%)CI = 1.2-32.1], p = 0.0002) or ESR (OR = 8.8 [(95%)CI = 1.5-50.1], p = 0.002) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was 0.84 or higher for PAE identification </plain></SENT>
