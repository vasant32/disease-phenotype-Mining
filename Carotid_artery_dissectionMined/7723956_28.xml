<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To analyze the value of ultrasound for early diagnosis and follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The carotid arteries were evaluated in 43 consecutive patients using extracranial and transcranial pulsed-wave Doppler and duplex sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ultrasound examination was performed, on average, 7.7 days after the first symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dissections subsequently were verified by MRI (16 patients), angiography (13 patients), or both (14 patients) on average 4.4 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall sensitivity of the combined examination was 95% (93% for extracranial Doppler, 86% for transcranial Doppler, and 79% for duplex sonography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three methods detected occlusions or high-grade stenoses in 100% of patients and moderate- or low-grade stenoses in 80% (combined methods), 70% (extracranial Doppler), 40% (transcranial Doppler), and 20% (duplex) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings in 33 patients with an occlusion or high-grade stenosis according to neuroradiology were as follows: absent flow signal in the internal carotid artery (100%) and biphasic (stump) flow in its bulb (86%), high-resistance flow pattern of the ipsilateral common carotid artery (91%), signs of collateral flow across the circle of Willis (97%), and low flow in the middle cerebral artery (79%) on transcranial insonation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, a moderate stenosis of the high cervical carotid segment was found because of a retromandibular high-velocity signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five of them this was the only abnormal finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Duplex examination was helpful because it confirmed absent internal carotid artery flow or stump flow in the case of occlusion or high-grade stenosis (100%) and excluded an atherosclerotic origin by demonstrating a patent bulb (100%) and the absence of plaques (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies showed recanalization in 63% of patients, occurring at variable intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occlusion persisted in 37% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound performed within the first weeks can corroborate a clinically suspected carotid dissection in up to 95% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repetitive follow-up studies in most cases are sufficient to monitor evolution </plain></SENT>
