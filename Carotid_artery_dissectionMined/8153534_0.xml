<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some cases are associated with cervical trauma or have evidence of an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>; many occur without any history of injury or detectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the cervical cephalic arteries, the extracranial segment of the internal carotid artery is the vessel most commonly involved; intracranial carotid dissections are much rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid dissection occurs predominantly in young or middle-aged adults and shows no sex predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although clinical manifestations can be extremely diverse (from isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> to rapidly lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), the most common and suggestive syndrome associates "local" symptoms (such as head or neck pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo> or lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsy</z:hpo>) and delayed (up to several weeks) symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in the territory of the internal carotid artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dissection can be bilateral or associated with dissection of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography has long been considered the gold standard for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As this procedure carries a risk of cerebral complications, noninvasive diagnostic approaches such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound have been developed and are increasingly used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of carotid dissections depends on the presence and severity of ischaemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent dissections seem extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Normalization or improvement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> during the subsequent weeks is frequent and is an excellent argument in favour of the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no controlled trial has ever been performed, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment is often used for a few months when the dissection involves the extracranial segment of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No standard treatment of intracranial carotid dissection has emerged </plain></SENT>
