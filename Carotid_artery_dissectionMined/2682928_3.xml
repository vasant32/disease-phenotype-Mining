<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1975 and 1988, 20 patients (11 women and 9 men; mean age 45 years) were admitted to the University Hospital of Angers for dissection of the ICA confirmed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dissections were unrelated to direct cervical injury and were unilateral in 18 cases and bilateral in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced transient cerebral ischaemic accidents (later completed in 2 cases) and 2 patients merely complained of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851688" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular disorders</z:e> of sympathetic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound followed by duplex scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These examinations were performed 10 days on average before angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continuous wave Doppler revealed signs of obstruction of the ICA in 95% of the cases: occlusion in 4 cases, tight stenosis in 13 cases and marked slowing of blood flow in the carotid and ophthalmic arteries in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The acoustic signs of high or extensive ICA stenosis with reduced or retrograde ophthalmic artery blood flow were fairly suggestive of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results were completed by mode B which showed signs of dissection in 61% of the cases (tapering stenosis or occlusion, tubular ICA, separation of the vascular walls on rare occasions) and excluded atheromatous lesions in 81% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The tubular ICA image being non-specific was interpreted in relation to the clinical context and haemodynamic data, after discussion and exclusion of fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> causing severe reduction of blood flow and the exceptional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the ICA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
