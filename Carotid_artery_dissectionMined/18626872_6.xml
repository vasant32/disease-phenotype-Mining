<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the value of color Doppler sonography (CDUS) in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with extracranial and intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-three patients aged 42 +/- 12 years with 40 VADS confirmed via digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (n = 37) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (n = 3) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were investigated with extracranial CDUS and transcranial CDUS (TCCDUS) over a mean +/- SD follow-up period of 42 +/- 24 months and occurrence of new ischemic symptoms was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sonographic results were compared with initial and follow-up angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At presentation, 24/33 (73%) patients had suffered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 5/33 (15%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), and 4/33 (12%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a recurrent vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>; there was no recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial DSA findings consisted of 14 stenoses, 20 tapered occlusions, and 6 pseudoaneurysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 63% of the vessels recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sonographic findings were consistent with angiographic findings in 80% at the initial examination and in 86% during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The main reason for discordant results was the failure of CDUS to detect pseudoaneurysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No recurrence occurred in the vertebral arteries (VA), but 1 patient had an asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after VAD appears to be extremely rare, independent of recanalization or persistent occlusion of the affected artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CDUS and TCCDUS provide reliable follow-up of VAD in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presenting with stenosis or occlusion, but do not allow for detection of pseudoaneurysms of the VA </plain></SENT>
