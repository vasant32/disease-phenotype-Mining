<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The causes of free-floating clots in the internal carotid artery were atheromatous stenosis in two cases, ulcerated plaque in three cases, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
