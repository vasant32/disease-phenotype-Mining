<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to report on single institutional long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spontaneous or posttraumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> over a 20-year period from August 1989 to July 2009 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with a mean age of 47 Â± 19.6 years were identified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six (25%) were related to trauma, while 23 (79%) were spontaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic symptoms included contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> (55%), facial pain (35%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (28%) presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic imaging modalities used included computed tomography angiography (52%), magnetic resonance angiography (41%), and conventional angiography (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty percent of patients had complete carotid occlusion and 25% had near occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most dissections (65%) had intracranial extension, and 35% were limited to the extracranial cervical internal carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority (96%) of patients were treated conservatively with anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent stenting for persistent symptoms resulting in complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, one from unrelated traumatic injuries and the other from unknown causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up was available for 20 patients: 14 had complete symptom resolution (70%) and five (25%) had partial clinical symptom resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two patients had initial resolution of symptoms, with subsequent recurrence that was successfully managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging revealed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> patency in 79% of patients with minimal residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed a small asymptomatic internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that did not require treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 1133.2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most cervical carotid dissections can safely be conservatively managed, with the majority achieving anatomic and symptomatic resolution, with low rates of recurrence over long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
