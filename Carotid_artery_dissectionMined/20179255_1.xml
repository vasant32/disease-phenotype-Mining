<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 38-year-old woman experienced a right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and right anterior and middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> due to unknown causes and subsequently developed vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> requiring right hemi-craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her postoperative course was complicated by multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and she developed multidrug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46765">carbapenem</z:chebi>-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebritis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated with a prolonged course of multiple antibiotics, including 18 days of therapy with tigecycline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-paired serum and CSF samples were obtained, and tigecycline concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report serial, steady-state, serum, and CSF concentrations of tigecycline when administered in the Food and Drug Administration-approved dose of 50 mg every 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF concentrations remained relatively stable, suggesting that tigecycline did not accumulate in the CSF, at least in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tigecycline concentrations in the CSF were between 0.035 and 0.048 mg/L, while corresponding serum concentrations were 0.097-0.566 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calculated tigecycline penetration ratio in this patient ranged from 0% to 52%, depending on the calculation methodology utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Concentrations, regardless of sample timing relative to dose, remained relatively stable in the CSF of our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pharmacodynamic profile of tigecycline is not completely elucidated; however, it is presumed that the drug must be at the site of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> for efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our patient never obtained tigecycline concentrations in excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration for A. baumannii in either the serum or the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our patient experienced low CSF tigecycline concentrations and failed to achieve a clinical response while on therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CSF drug disposition of tigecycline requires further systematic study to fully elucidate the pharmacokinetic profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reduced CSF concentrations urge caution in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebritis</z:e> with standard dosing of tigecycline </plain></SENT>
