<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> has increasingly been reported as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, scarce data exist on the natural history of the arterial lesions and the temporal profile of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed 48 patients with 50 angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissections</z:e> by sequential duplex Doppler studies in 2- to 4-day intervals during the first weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and after 4 weeks in 1- to 2-month intervals for up to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed sonographic features as well as the frequency and time course of resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial Doppler findings were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, most of whom (68%) presented with a characteristic bidirectional high-resistance Doppler signal in the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gradual recanalization was found in 68% of the dissections after an average interval of 51 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes of Doppler flow patterns in follow-up studies and features of intra-arterial angiography correlated with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and mirrored the recanalization process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Doppler sonography provides early recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> and monitoring of its resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ultrasound studies may guide clinical decisions according to the development of the dissection </plain></SENT>
