<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection by stent-assisted thrombolysis has been recently proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic ICA dissection with tandem occlusion successfully treated with emergent endovascular stent-assisted thrombolysis using new self-expandable intracranial stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 37-year-old woman and a 59-year-old man were admitted in our hospital after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe symptoms of right-hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores of 15 and 18, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both cases, magnetic resonance angiography showed tandem occlusion and angiography confirmed tandem occlusion with ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extensive mismatch region was diagnosed by Perfusion-diffusion MRI of the brain within 3 h after symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment was initiated 4 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by implantation of self-expandable intracranial stents into the dissected ICA and administration of intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization of the ICA and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was accomplished within 6 h after symptoms <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both cases, no periprocedural complication was observed and follow-up CT scan showed only a mild brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After, respectively, 12 and 10 months follow-up, patients had a favorable outcome with NIHSS 0 and mRS &lt; or = 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular stent-assisted thrombolysis appears to be a promising treatment in tandem occlusion due to ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our work underline the potential use of self-expandable intracranial stents in symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
