<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Intracranial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> release has been associated with post-carotid endarterectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in human beings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study this phenomenon under more controlled conditions, we studied the relationship of cerebral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and blood pressure in gerbils, whose cerebral circulation is similar to that in human beings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve anesthetized gerbils underwent iliac artery blood pressure monitoring and in vivo electrochemistry <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> monitoring with use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-specific electrodes placed stereotactically into the cerebral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six gerbils underwent 10 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ischemic), whereas six underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> without occlusion (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The control group demonstrated a continuous gradual decline in blood pressure and striatal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> during the 150-minute observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast the ischemic gerbils demonstrated a sharp <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> rise during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a marked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> drop shortly after carotid artery unclamping, and then a secondary larger <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release that peaks in 60 minutes and gradually returns to baseline in 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure closely followed the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> levels, with a sharp 20 mm Hg rise in blood pressure above baseline during carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by a dramatic 10 mm Hg drop below baseline after carotid artery unclamping and then a gradual rise of the blood pressure 25 mm Hg above baseline, which peaks in 80 minutes, with a gradual decline to the same blood pressure as in the control subjects 120 minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that striatal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> release correlates with peripheral blood pressure during transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may explain the mechanism of post-carotid endarterectomy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in human beings, and this gerbil model can be used to study its prevention and treatment </plain></SENT>
