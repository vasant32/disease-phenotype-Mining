<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid dissection is now considered one of the most frequent aetiologies of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients less than 50 years of age and it accounts for 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases under the age of 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper we describe clinical course and investigations in four patients who had dissection of the precerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had ischaemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had symptoms following physiotherapy to the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Patients with craniocervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> should be investigated with ultrasound techniques and MRI or CT; antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation therapy should be considered </plain></SENT>
