<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> triggered by an elongated styloid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 43-year-old man presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> followed by speech disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography scans revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction and right ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a hyperintensity in the occluded ICA, suggesting intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic angiography also revealed ICA occlusion and bilateral elongated styloid processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed transoral carotid ultrasonography, which revealed the absence of flow signal in the double lumen of the dilated extracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed his condition as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> and treated him with antithrombotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months later, the occluded ICA recanalized spontaneously, and computed tomographic angiography at that time revealed a close relation between the tip of the styloid process and the recanalized ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that an elongated styloid process is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with ICA occlusion of unknown etiology, an evaluation for intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and styloid process length are useful for the diagnosis of dissection and its etiology </plain></SENT>
