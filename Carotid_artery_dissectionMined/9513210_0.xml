<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of an autopsy of a 78-year-old female patient with an occluded of the right internal carotid artery after a traffic accident are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She presented with consciousness disturbance, right conjugate deviation, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and left pathological reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence of right skull and clavicular fractures seemed to suggest that severe hyperextension of her neck associated with contralateral lateral flexion had stretched her carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although she was treated with antiplatelet therapy, her cerebral swelling due to right global infarction progressed and she died due to bilateral cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> three days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The autopsy disclosed right dissecting carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and subadventitial dissection was revealed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> dissect the media and adventitia of the carotid artery wall, the outer wall weakens and may dilate without narrowing the lumen of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this case, the vessel occlusion was considered to be due to a primary intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> which developed and subsequently ruptured through the intima into the vessel lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and treatment are necessary for improving the prognosis of this disease entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A patient with poor colateral flow, such as in this case, will show a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is best to consider surgical treatment in this case if the other traumatic lesions are able to tolerate surgery </plain></SENT>
