<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chart review was performed for 49 patients with CAD and VAD admitted to Westchester Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, from 1999 to 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presentation was categorized into traumatic (n=28, 57%) or spontaneous dissection (n=21, 43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-morbid risk factors were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Location of dissection was identified and categorized into four possible segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with spontaneous dissection were likely to be over the age of 50 years (p&lt;0.05), and had significantly higher proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (33% compared to 7%, p&lt;0.05), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (57% compared to 18%; p&lt;0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (29% compared to 0%; p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 49 patients, 42 had imaging studies available for segmental analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both traumatic CAD and VAD, dissection at Segment III (corresponds with the first and second cervical vertebrae), was the most common site (37.5% and 50%, respectively, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Segment I (origin of the vessel to the fifth cervical vertebrae) was the most common site for spontaneous CAD and VAD (55% and 77%, respectively, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This cross-sectional study suggests that etiology plays an important role in the location of dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Traumatic CAD and VAD occur most commonly in Segment III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous CAD and VAD occur most commonly in Segment I and are associated with increasing age and premorbid cerebrovascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
