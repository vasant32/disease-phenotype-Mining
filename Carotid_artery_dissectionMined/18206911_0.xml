<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a 43-year-old patient with blunt traumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> associated with subocclusive stenosis and major cerebral thromboembolic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Combined, simultaneous intra-arterial fibrinolysis and carotid stenting through a bilateral approach was successfully performed allowing the complete clinical recovery of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contralateral carotid artery approach allowed the beginning of intra-arterial thrombolysis without delay, while stent-assisted angioplasty of the injured carotid was simultaneously performed </plain></SENT>
