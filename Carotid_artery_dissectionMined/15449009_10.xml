<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose was to evaluate the diagnostic results of different ultrasound techniques: color-coded Doppler (CCD), power Doppler (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) and B-flow in the diagnosis of vascular dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings from 68 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> proven either by vascular ultrasound (US) or by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were reviewed in retrospect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study compared results from three different modes of ultrasound, i.e., CCD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and B-flow, in dissections of the carotid artery (n=11), of the vertebral artery (n=9), of the abdominal aorta (n=13), of the iliac artery (n=12) and of the femoral artery (n=23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA, CTA and DSA were considered as reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of CCD for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> dissections was 78%, 84% for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and 98% for B-flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e>, the sensitivity of CCD, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and B-flow was 82, 91 and 98%, for the vertebral artery 67, 78 and 98%, for the abdominal aorta 85, 85 and 98%, for the iliac artery 67, 75 and 98%, for the femoral artery 83, 87 and 98%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intima flaps, fissures of membranes and residual flow within the true and false lumen were better detected by B-flow than by CCD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of angle dependence of the US probe in B-flow made the examination procedure easier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cine mode of B-flow, the pulse synchronic movement of the membrane was more apparent than in any other imaging method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With B-flow, accuracy for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> is improved compared to CCD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Flow within the true and false lumen, low-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and even movements of the dissection membrane are clearly distinguished </plain></SENT>
