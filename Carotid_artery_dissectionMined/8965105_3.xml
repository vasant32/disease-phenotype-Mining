<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients with 67 ICADs diagnosed by angiography, Doppler duplex sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were studied prospectively during the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to current pathophysiological concepts, cortical territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and large subcortical lenticulostriate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> revealed by CT or MRI were classified as embolic, while smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the subcortical junctional zone and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the cortical borderzone between the middle (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and anterior cerebral artery were interpreted as haemodynamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 67 dissections 37 (55%) were associated with brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, of which territorial <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of variable size accounted for 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were combined with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the anterior and posterior cerebral artery in 5%; 8% of the patients had complete <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large lenticulostriate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involved the subcortical junctional zone in 16% but never the anterior cortical borderzone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although different abnormal Doppler findings indicated haemodynamically significant carotid obstruction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> symptomatic ICADs, only the characteristic high-resistance Doppler signal was significantly associated with the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (in 66%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patterns of infarction in ICAD indicate a predominantly embolic causation probably due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the dissected carotid artery in the presence of severe haemodynamic obstruction, as demonstrated by Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
