<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Saccular pseudoaneurysm formation may be an associated finding, especially in the presence of tortuosity (coiling) of the cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of eight patients with nine vessels demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> on arteriography, pseudoaneurysms were found in five arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the five pseudoaneurysms occurred in tortuous (coiled) arterial segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thin-section contrast-enhanced dynamic incremental CT showed close agreement with the findings on selective arteriography and provided additional information on the presence and configuration of arterial wall thickening as well as the extent of the pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience indicates that CT may play an important role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of this lesion </plain></SENT>
