<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe two such cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first case, a 19-year-old female was involved in a road traffic accident, when her car crashed into the rear of another car </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, the young woman presented a minor head injury without <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and minor <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>bruising</z:mp> to the left side of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 48 h, she had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, speech difficulties, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial nerve paralysis</z:hpo>, and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scan and carotid angiography showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with infarction in the territory of the middle left cerebral artery and complete dissection of the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second case, a 33-year-old male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> attempted to hang himself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rope gave way and he fell down </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He had also taken a <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi>, and a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</z:chebi> overdose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He did not lose consciousness but appeared withdrawn and depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Approximately 6 h later, his conscious state deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A CT scan revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left internal carotid artery, extending to the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both cases reinforce the need for full neurological assessment and review of any individual subject to blunt trauma to the neck, whether accidental or deliberate or where the history is incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the forensic setting, in particular, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTAs</z:e>, suspension by the neck, strangulation, and garotting are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances when examination and assessment must be thorough--and clear advice given--in the absence of any immediate signs or symptoms--that any new symptoms or signs require immediate and thorough neurological investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There should be low threshold for prolonged neurological observation or further neurovascular investigations such as ultrasound, CT or MRI scan or angiography, to minimize the risk of developing potentially fatal or incapacitating sequelae </plain></SENT>
