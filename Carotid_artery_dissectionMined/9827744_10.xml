<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of dissection can be either traumatic or spontaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of spontaneous dissection is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once considered very rare, an increased awareness, combined with noninvasive evaluation by ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography, has demonstrated a more frequent occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trivial trauma (ie, rather than external blunt or penetrating trauma) such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> has rarely been documented as causing bilateral dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is well recognized by neurologists but often not by other physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prognosis is good, but delay in diagnosis may result in residual neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It should therefore be suspected early, especially in younger patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
