<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Kinship theory suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> could account for phenotypic behaviors that increase (in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>) or decrease (for Prader-Willi syndrome) the drive to access social resources (adult contact) depending on the imprinting parent-of-origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Difficult to manage behaviors, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> that is common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, could serve the function of increasing social interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that the commonly reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behavior</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> will be attention maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experimental functional analysis was carried out with twelve children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> caused by either a deletion (n=10) or <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative increase and decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviors</z:hpo> was observed in response to experimentally manipulated levels of adult attention and demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Laughing and smiling, crying and frowning, and physical initiation with an adult were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>Aggression</z:hpo> was seen in ten of the twelve children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One child evidenced a pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> across conditions consistent with maintenance by attention, three children showed higher levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> during social interaction and two children showed escape motivated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: With the exception of one child the results did not confirm the hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the pattern of increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> in the high social contact condition combined with evidence of positive affect during this condition suggests <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> may serve to both maintain and initiate social contact and this interpretation is consistent with previous research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The negative results may also have been influenced by the age of the children and the low levels of observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
