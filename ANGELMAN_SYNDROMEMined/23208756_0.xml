<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To deepen the intrigue, the transcripts in the human chromosome 15q11-q13 region are subject to regulation by <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, and some of these transcripts are imprinted in a tissue-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the region is critically important for three human neurogenetic disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, Prader-Willi syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795858" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">15q duplication syndrome</z:e>, there is intense interest in understanding the types of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> processing that occurs among the imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes what is known about the various <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> within the imprinted domain, including a novel type of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> that was only very recently identified </plain></SENT>
