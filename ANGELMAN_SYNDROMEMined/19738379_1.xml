<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (NIPA) proteins are highly conserved receptors or transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Translocation of NIPA genes were found in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, and loss-of-function of the NIPA1 gene was identified in hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001258'>spastic paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The family of NIPA-like domain containing (NPAL) proteins is closely related to the NIPA proteins, but to date nothing is known about their function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we could demonstrate that both human NPAL3 and mouse NPAL3 are ubiquitously expressed and encode highly conserved proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate the function of the Npal3 gene, knockout (Npal3(-/-)) mice were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intensive phenotypic analyses revealed that disruption of the Npal3 gene results in a pleiotropic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The function of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system was impaired in both mutant males and females which could be demonstrated in behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, in NPAL3 mutants the number of NK cells was decreased and changes in IgM, IgG(2), and IgA were observed, indicating that the immune system is also affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003212'>increased IgE levels</z:hpo> as well as impaired lung functions were observed in mutant males but not in mutant females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the human Npal3 gene is located at 1p36.12--&gt;p35.1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> were previously linked to this genomic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Npal3(-/-) mice could serve as a valuable model system for studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857523" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atopic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
