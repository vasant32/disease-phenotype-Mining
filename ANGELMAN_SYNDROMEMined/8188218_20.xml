<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GABRB3, which encompasses 250 kb, is located 100 kb proximal of GABRA5, with the two genes arranged in head-to-head transcriptional orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In screening 135 kb of cloned DNA within a 260-kb interval extending from within GABRB3 to the 5' end of GABRA5, 10 new (CA)n repeats have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these have been analyzed in detail and found to be highly polymorphic, with the polymorphism information content (PIC) ranging from 0.7 to 0.85 and with heterozygosities of 67 to 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the clones from GABRB3/GABRA5 region, therefore, the frequency of (CA)n with PICs &gt; or = 0.7 is 1 per 27 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous estimates of the density of (CA)n with PICs &gt; or = 0.7 in the human genome have been approximately 10-fold lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GABRB3/GABRA5 region appears, therefore, to be enriched for highly informative (CA)n </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This set of closely spaced, short tandem repeat polymorphisms will be useful in the molecular analyses of Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> and in high-resolution studies of genetic recombination within this region </plain></SENT>
