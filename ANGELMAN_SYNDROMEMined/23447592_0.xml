<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cellular role of Ube3a remains enigmatic despite recent descriptions of synaptic and behavioral deficits in AS mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although neuron-specific imprinting is thought to limit the disease to the brain, Ube3a is expressed ubiquitously, suggesting a broader role in cellular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we demonstrate a profound structural disruption and cisternal swelling of the Golgi apparatus (GA) in the cortex of AS (UBE3A) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Ube3a knockdown cell lines and UBE3A cortical neurons, the GA is severely under-acidified, leading to osmotic swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both in vitro and in vivo, the loss of Ube3a and corresponding elevated pH of the GA is associated with a marked reduction in protein sialylation, a process highly dependent on intralumenal Golgi pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered ion homeostasis of the GA may provide a common cellular pathophysiology underlying the diverse plasticity and neurodevelopmental deficits associated with AS </plain></SENT>
