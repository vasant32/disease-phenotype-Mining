<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure to detect deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 or the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> were not considered sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The EEG patterns characteristic of AS were found within the first 2 years of life (under 18 months in the majority of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that AS should be included in differential diagnosis in a child aged under 12 months having cryptogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> with prevalent language compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat EEG recordings are needed to check for the typical trace, and cytogenetic investigations are mandatory </plain></SENT>
