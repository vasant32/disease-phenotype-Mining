<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting clinical phenotype (PWS or AS) in each class of genomic abnormalities depends on the parent of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both disorders are characterized at the molecular level by abnormal methylation of imprinted regions at 15q11.2-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other rare chromosome 15 rearrangements and a few smaller atypical deletions associated with abnormal methylation patterns also have symptoms overlapping with either PWS or AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We designed a methylation-specific melting analysis (MS-MA) method for a rapid screening of PWS/AS and evaluated methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) for diagnosis of PWS/AS associated with deletions, UPD15, or rare duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine previously genotyped samples were tested by MS-MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also tested 26 MS-MA genotyped samples and 1 additional sample with rare duplication of chromosome region 15q11-q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PWS/AS genotyping results obtained by MS-MA and by MS-MLPA were fully concordant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, MS-MLPA was superior in detecting deletions/rare duplications, possible UPD15, or imprinting center defects, which were usually determined by a laborious fluorescence in situ hybridization method or by chromosomal segregation analysis for the parental-origin using short-tandem repeat makers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MS-MA appears to be an efficient primary method to diagnose PWS/AS, and use of the quantitative MS-MLPA method provides detailed information about deletions, rare duplications, and possibly UPD </plain></SENT>
