<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These sites lie close to the imprinting center (IC) for this domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, recombinants for Ube3a within the same imprinted domain were recovered with equal frequency on the maternal and paternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, gene targeting of the paternal allele for Snurf-Snrpn resulted in partial or complete demethylation in trans with activation of expression for the previously silenced maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imprint switching of the maternal allele in trans is not readily explained by competition for trans-acting factors and adds to a growing body of evidence indicating homologous association of oppositely imprinted chromatin domains in somatic mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
