<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Maternally derived duplications of the 15q11-q13 region are the most frequently reported chromosomal aberrations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, caused by 15q11-q13 deletions or abnormal methylation of imprinted genes, are also associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of these disorders in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of 15q11-q13 rearrangements in a large sample of patients ascertained for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 522 patients belonging to 430 families were screened for deletions, duplications, and methylation abnormalities involving 15q11-q13 with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified four patients with 15q11-q13 abnormalities: a supernumerary chromosome 15, a paternal interstitial duplication, and two subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, one with a maternal deletion and the other with a paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that abnormalities of the 15q11-q13 region are a significant cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, accounting for approximately 1% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal interstitial 15q11-q13 duplications, previously reported to be present in 1% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, were not detected in our sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although paternal duplications of chromosome 15 remain phenotypically silent in the majority of patients, they can give rise to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> in some subjects, suggesting that paternally expressed genes in this region can contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>, albeit with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>reduced penetrance</z:hpo> compared with maternal duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> should be routinely screened for 15q genomic imbalances and methylation abnormalities and that MLPA is a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective method to perform this screening </plain></SENT>
