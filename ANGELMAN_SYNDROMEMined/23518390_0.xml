<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four children with AS were exposed to a multiple schedule arrangement, in which social reinforcement and extinction, cued using a novel stimulus, were alternated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five to 35 discrimination training sessions were conducted and levels of approach behaviors were measured before and after the discrimination training for two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four participants evidenced discrimination between conditions of reinforcement and extinction after 16-20 teaching sessions as indicated by lower rates of social approach behaviors in the presence of the S(Î”) for extinction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reversal effects for the two children for whom this design was implemented were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that after repeated training, the use of a novel stimulus can serve as a cue for children with AS to discriminate adult availability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is a potentially effective component of a broader intervention strategy but highlights the need for sustained teaching procedures within this population </plain></SENT>
