<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three children and adolescents (median age 6 years, range 18 months to 23 years) were consecutively investigated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751265" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">learning disability</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and motor dysfunction to detect suspected AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three individuals (13 males, 10 females; median age 5 years 6 months, range 21 months to 23 years) fulfilled international consensus criteria for AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis was supported by a positive DNA methylation test in eleven participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten participants (seven males, three females; median age six years, range 18 months to 13 years) did not comply with consensus criteria for AS and were regarded as a comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the AS and the comparison group regarding age or developmental level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median developmental quotient level was 26 months (range 8 to 63 months); median gross motor developmental level in participants with AS was 24 months (range 8 to 60 months); median fine motor developmental level was 15 months (range 6 to 60 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle strength, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, and coactivation were assessed: distal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002061'>lower limb spasticity</z:hpo>, ataxic like gait, stiff lower limbs, and the presence of coactivation during locomotion were significantly more frequent in participants with AS than in the comparison group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry of muscle strength and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>Neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> were insufficient for a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> and impeded function less than immaturity in both AS groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risk of increasing impairment needs to be anticipated to prevent negative long-term effects of muscle imbalance and motor asymmetries in individuals with AS </plain></SENT>
