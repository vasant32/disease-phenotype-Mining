<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mouse ortholog of the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> imprinted domain contains several paternal-specific transcripts and the maternally expressed gene encoding ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (Ube3a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Large paternal Non-Coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, encompassing Snurf-Snrpn exons and the Ube3a Antisense Transcript (Ube3a-ATS), has been recently characterized and named here LNCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Potential roles of LNCAT in imprinting, gene regulation, and disease are likely but have not been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to establish the function(s) of LNCAT, we first determined its in vivo spatio-temporal expression pattern at the cellular level during development and in different adult brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show here that LNCAT is developmentally regulated, with transcript variants being specifically expressed through neuronal differentiation in postmitotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the LNCAT and Snurf-Snrpn transcripts are independent although they share common exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We show an absence of expression of LNCAT through gametogenesis and in early embryo excluding a role of LNCAT in the imprint establishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also report a range of observations that challenges the widely accepted model of imprinted gene silencing of Ube3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although these last data do not completely exclude that the LNCAT variants including "Ube3a-ATS"exons could repress the paternal allele of Ube3a, they do allow us to propose an alternative and consistent model </plain></SENT>
