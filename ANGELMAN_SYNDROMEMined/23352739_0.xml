<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Deletion of the chromosome 15q11-q13, the most common genetic mechanism associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, is highly associated with a severe phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, deletion is not a genetically homogeneous group as it is composed by two main groups: Class I with breakpoints at BP1 (proximal) and BP3 (distal) and Class II present breakpoints at BP2 (proximal) and BP3 (distal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the breakpoint on the electroclinical profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated 16 patients with AS caused by 15q11-13 deletion (6 were Class I; 10 were Class II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> features by clinical history obtained from parents and caretakers with a pre-standard questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data were corroborated by medical records, contact with previous physicians, and video-EEG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suggestive EEG patterns for AS were classified according to the classical description of Boyd et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(1988) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AS patients with BP1-BP3 deletion had significantly more daily and disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> than AS patients with BP1-BP2 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also presented a significant higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852977" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy aggravated</z:e> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Need for polytherapy was significantly more frequent in BP1-BP3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>EEG features were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows a significant correlation between the two deletion classes and AS clinical, but not the electrographic phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> is more severe and refractory to treatment in patients with larger deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Deletion is not a homogeneous group and knowledge on the breakpoint may have a clinical implication and represent an important factor in parental counseling </plain></SENT>
