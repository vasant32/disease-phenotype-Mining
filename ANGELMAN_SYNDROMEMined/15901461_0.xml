<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS is caused by a wide variety of genetic mechanisms, including mutations in the UBE3A gene that have been identified in 10-15% of patients; when the mother is heterozygous for the causative mutation, the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present authors have developed a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26337">PGD</z:chebi>) assay for a family displaying a 10 bp deletion in exon 9 of the UBE3A gene, which was shared by two affected children and their phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A duplex polymerase chain reaction protocol was established, allowing the efficient amplification of the mutation together with an informative microsatellite marker (D15S122) located in intron 1 of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As most of UBE3A mutations identified so far are unique to one family, the present authors have also developed an indirect single cell protocol based upon the co-amplification of two microsatellite markers located within (D15S122) and close to the UBE3A gene (D15S1506) </plain></SENT>
