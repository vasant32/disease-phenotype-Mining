<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: High-resolution G-banding karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosomes were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two AS patients and 1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetus in the family were successfully detected by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our result demonstrated that patient with type I AS could be detected by combining the techniques of high-resolution G-banding and FISH with clinical observation, which would offer accurate genetic counseling information to the geneticists and provide the prenatal diagnosis for the AS family </plain></SENT>
