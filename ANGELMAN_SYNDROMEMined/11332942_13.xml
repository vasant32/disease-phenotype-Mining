<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 32-y-old woman with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and her daughter with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PWS in the mother was confirmed as due to a deletion of 15q11-q13, and molecular analysis in the neonate indicated an inherited maternal deletion of the same region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Features of AS in early infancy, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>jerky movements</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding problems</z:hpo> and poor sleep, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 5 mo of age, a triphasic high voltage EEG pattern was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: This case confirms the non-Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of PWS and AS and, in addition to previous reports, provides evidence of fertility in PWS women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recommend the provision of information regarding fertility in females with PWS to parents, guardians and individuals with PWS, and frequent EEG monitoring for early AS diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given the different genetic aetiologies for PWS and AS, cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis is strongly indicated for counselling and risk estimation </plain></SENT>
