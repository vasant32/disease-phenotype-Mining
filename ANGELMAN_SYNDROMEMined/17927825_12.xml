<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The beta3 subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> type A receptor (GABAA-R) has been reported to be important for palate formation, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> action, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This subunit has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further investigate involvement of this subunit, we previously produced mice with a global knockout of beta3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, developmental abnormalities, compensation, <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp>, and numerous behavioral abnormalities limited the usefulness of that murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To overcome many of these limitations, a mouse line with a conditionally inactivated beta3 gene was engineered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene targeting and embryonic stem cell technologies were used to create mice in which exon 3 of the beta3 subunit was flanked by loxP sites (i.e., floxed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crossing the floxed beta3 mice to a cre general deleter mouse line reproduced the phenotype of the previously described global knockout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pan-neuronal knockout of beta3 was achieved by crossing floxed beta3 mice to Synapsin I-cre transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Palate development was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in pan-neuronal beta3 knockouts but ~61% died as neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survivors were overtly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, fertile, and were less sensitive to etomidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Forebrain selective knockout of beta3 was achieved using alpha CamKII-cre transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Palate development was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in forebrain selective beta3 knockout mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These knockouts survived the neonatal period, but ~30% died between 15-25 days of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Survivors had reduced reproductive fitness, reduced sensitivity to etomidate, were <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp>, and some became <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conditional inactivation of the beta3 gene revealed novel insight into the function of this GABAA-R subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The floxed beta3 knockout mice described here will be very useful for conditional knockout studies to further investigate the role of the beta3 subunit in development, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> action, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, and pathophysiologic processes </plain></SENT>
