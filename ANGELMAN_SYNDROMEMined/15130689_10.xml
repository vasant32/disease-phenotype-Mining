<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> in a relatively large group of AS subjects, compared to that of age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine consecutive parents of patients with AS (26 males and 23 females aged 2.3-26.2 years) were interviewed and filled out a comprehensive sleep questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on their genetic etiology, four groups were defined: deletion of chromosome 15q11-13 (25 subjects); methylation imprinting mutation (six subjects), UBE3A mutations (seven subjects) and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (five subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining cases genetic testings were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021603" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep</z:e>, prolonged sleep latency, prolonged wakefulness after sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, high number of night awakenings and reduced total sleep time were found in our AS patients, as compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found other types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e>, never reported before, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000805'>enuresis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003763'>bruxism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037320" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep terrors</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">somnambulism</z:e>, nocturnal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002487'>hyperkinesia</z:hpo>, and snoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between the four genetic aetiology groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we did not find important improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> from pre-pubertal to post-pubertal ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the significant presence of sleep/wake rhythms fragmentation, peculiar of AS, and also demonstrate the presence of several other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
