<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions of the exon 1 region impair the establishment or maintenance of the paternal imprint and can cause Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletions of a region 35 kb upstream of exon 1 impair <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> and can cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected sibs with an imprinting defect, an inherited IC deletion was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report on two sibs with AS who do not have an IC deletion but instead have a 1-1.5 Mb inversion separating the two IC elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inversion is transmitted silently through the male germline but impairs <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> after transmission through the female germline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the close proximity and/or the correct orientation of the two IC elements are/is necessary for the establishment of a maternal imprint </plain></SENT>
