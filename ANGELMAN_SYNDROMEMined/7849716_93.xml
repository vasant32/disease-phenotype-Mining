<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have isolated a novel gene from the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) smallest region of deletion overlap in proximal human chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IPW (Imprinted gene in the Prader-Willi syndrome region) was isolated using the direct selection method and yeast artificial chromosomes localized to the deletion region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IPW is spliced and polyadenylated but its longest open reading frame codes for only 45 amino acids, suggesting that it functions as an <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, similar to H19 and XIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> is widely expressed in adult and fetal tissues and is found in the cytoplasmic fraction of human cells, which is also the case for the H19 non-translated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, but differs from the XIST <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> which is found predominantly in the nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a sequence polymorphism, exclusive expression from the paternal allele in lymphoblasts and fibroblasts was demonstrated; monoallelic expression was found in fetal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IPW is located about 150 kb distal to SNRPN, the only other known gene in the deletion interval, and about 50 kb proximal to the breakpoint of a translocation which defines the distal end of the PWS region and the proximal end of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As is the case with SNRPN, PWS patients with 15q11-q13 deletions do not express IPW, whereas expression is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lack of expression of IPW may contribute to the PWS phenotype directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> product of IPW may play a role in the imprinting process, acting either on genes located proximally in the PWS region or distally in the AS region </plain></SENT>
