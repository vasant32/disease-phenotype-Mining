<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chromosomal abnormalities affecting human chromosome 15q11-q13 underlie multiple genomic disorders caused by deletion, duplication and triplication of intervals in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These events are mediated by highly homologous segments of DNA, or duplicons, that facilitate mispairing and unequal cross-over in meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding an amyloid precursor protein-binding protein (APBA2) was previously mapped to the distal portion of the interval commonly deleted in Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> and duplicated in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that this gene actually maps to a more telomeric location and is partially duplicated within the broader region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two highly homologous copies of an interval containing a large 5' exon and downstream sequence are located approximately 5 Mb distal to the intact locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duplicated copies, containing the first coding exon of APBA2, can be distinguished by single nucleotide sequence differences and are transcriptionally inactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adjacent to APBA2 maps a gene termed KIAA0574 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protein encoded by this gene is weakly homologous to a protein termed X123 that in turn maps adjacent to APBA1 on 9q21.12; APBA1 is highly homologous to APBA2 in the C-terminal region and is distinguished from APBA2 by the N-terminal region encoded by this duplicated exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The duplication of APBA2 sequences in this region adds to a complex picture of different low copy repeats present across this region and elsewhere on the chromosome </plain></SENT>
