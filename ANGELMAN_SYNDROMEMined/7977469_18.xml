<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of probes containing segments of DNA from chromosome region 15q11-q13 provides the opportunity to confirm the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated FISH studies and high resolution chromosome banding studies in 14 patients referred to confirm or rule out PWS and five patients referred to confirm or rule out AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four patients (three from the PWS category and 1 from the AS group) chromosome analysis suggested that a deletion was present but FISH failed to confirm the finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one AS group patient, FISH identified a deletion not detectable by high resolution banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Review of the clinical findings in the discrepant cases suggested that the FISH results were correct and high resolution findings were erroneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies with a chromosome 15 alpha satellite probe (D15Z) on both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal individuals suggested that incorrect interpretation of chromosome banding may occasionally be attributable to alpha satellite polymorphism but other variation of 15q11-q13 chromosome bands also contributes to misinterpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients who have been reported to have a cytogenetic deletion of 15q11-q13 and who have clinical findings inconsistent with PWS and AS should be re-evaluated by molecular genetic techniques </plain></SENT>
