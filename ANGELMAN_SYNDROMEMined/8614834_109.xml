<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A temporal and spatial association between maternal and paternal chromosomes 15 was observed in human T lymphocytes by three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This association occurred specifically at the imprinted 15q11-q13 regions only during the late S phase of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from PWS and AS patients were deficient in association, which suggests that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprinting involves mutual recognition and preferential association of maternal and paternal chromosomes 15 </plain></SENT>
