<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are two clinically distinct neurobehavioral syndromes that are caused by deficiency of gene expression from paternally or maternally derived homologues on chromosome 15q11-q13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneities</z:hpo> are common in both syndromes and they are now regarded as 'sister <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genetic imprinting</z:mp> syndromes' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to describe and compare the electroclinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> between PWS and AS, and to try to explore the possible mechanisms of epileptogenesis in these two syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty patients with genetically documented PWS and 18 patients with a putative diagnosis of AS were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were diagnosed on the basis of characteristic physical findings and their neurobehavioral phenotype, as well as cytogenetic and molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were present in 16 of 18 patients with AS, but in only eight of 50 patients with PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using electroencephalography (EEG), the most characteristic findings for AS were rhythmic 2-3 Hz delta waves of high-amplitude that were maximal over the frontal regions, and 3-4 Hz spikes and sharp wave runs posteriorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were never seen in PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with AS had a much higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with characteristic EEG findings, similar to those seen in mice that are deficient in a single gene (UBE3A) that displays regional brain-specific imprinting in humans and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this series, cases with no detectable cytogenetic or molecular defect at the AS locus displayed similar AS phenotype, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> severity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> compared to those with such a defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the UBE3A gene is presumed to be potentially involved in the epileptogenesis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that UBE3A and another gene located nearby, gamma-aminobutyric receptorbeta3 subunit, may interact in some way, and result in the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> seen with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Some patients with PWS and AS share the common EEG features of persistent high-amplitude 4-6 Hz activity in recordings during sleep, and while awake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The significance of such EEG findings needs further experience to clarity </plain></SENT>
