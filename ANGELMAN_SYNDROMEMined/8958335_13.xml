<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The AS gene(s) is exclusively expressed from the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several kinds of mutations have been found to cause AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More than half of the cases exhibit a deletion of the maternal 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, we and others described a new mutation type, the imprinting mutation, characterised by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> but aberrant methylation patterns of the entire chromosomal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AS, a paternal imprint is found on the maternal chromosome probably leading to functional inactivation of the AS gene(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have now compared the phenotype of 9 AS patients with imprinting mutation to that of nine age-matched ones with a maternally derived deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both groups were evaluated for 19 common AS symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, independently of their molecular findings, showed classical AS symptoms such s <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001270'>delayed motor development</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001344'>absent speech</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for two signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, a different distribution among both groups was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one of nine AS patients with an imprinting mutation, but seven of nine in the deletion control group showed either symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that imprinting mutations, in contrast to deletions, cause only incomplete loss of gene function or that maternally derived deletions affect also genes not subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that AS is caused by loss of function of a major gene that is imprinted but that there are also other genes that contribute to the phenotype when in hemizygous condition </plain></SENT>
