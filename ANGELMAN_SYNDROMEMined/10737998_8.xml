<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS-specific DNA methylation is found in patients carrying 3-4 Mb deletions ( approximately 70%), paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (3-5%) or imprinting center mutations (2-9%), while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern with biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> characterizes the remaining approximately 20-25% AS patients (Stalker et al.,1998; Tsai et al.,1998) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Ubiquitin protein ligase 3A gene (UBE3A) have been found in the latter group, but only preliminary figures are available on their frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected a sample of 25 AS patients with a clinical diagnosis of AS and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern in order to search for mutations of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Automated sequencing of exons 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 performed on our 25 patients allowed us to identify three novel mutations: an 897insA in two unrelated familial cases, a 2544insA and an E167X in two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
