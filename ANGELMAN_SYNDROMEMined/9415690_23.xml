<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The putative promoter region of the SNRPN gene contains a CpG island which is heavily methylated in the maternally derived allele and unmethylated in the paternally derived allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) only the methylated allele is present, while in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> only the unmethylated allele is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to report a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay to evaluate methylation status of the CpG island of the SNRPN gene and to show that this assay allows rapid diagnosis of PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> in the CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> are resistant to chemical modification by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment converts <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unmethylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on this differential effect, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-modified DNA sequence of a methylated allele was successfully distinguished from that of an unmethylated allele using 2 sets of allele-specific primer pairs: a methylated allele-specific primer pair (MET) and an unmethylated allele-specific primer pair (UNMET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">Bisulfite</z:chebi>-modified DNA from 10 patients with PWS amplified only with the MET pair while modified DNA from 5 patients with AS amplified only with the UNMET pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Modified DNA from 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> unrelated individuals amplified with both primer pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In that methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) can detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> presently testable causes of PWS and AS in a rapid and cost-effective fashion, serious consideration should be given to the use of this test in the initial evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in which PWS or AS is being considered </plain></SENT>
