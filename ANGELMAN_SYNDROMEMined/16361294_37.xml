<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent reports have suggested a higher risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> after assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), but it is unclear whether this might also apply to other disorders of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We contacted families of children with BWS, AS, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM) to determine use of ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency of ART in children with BWS was confirmed [2.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-6.3% vs 0.8% expected] but there was no significant association with PWS or TNDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consideration of the molecular subgroup of BWS and AS suggested the feasibility of association with ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These differences may relate to variations in (i) the molecular mechanisms for disordered imprinting in the different disorders and (ii) the susceptibility of specific imprinting control regions to ART-associated methylation alterations (epimutations) </plain></SENT>
