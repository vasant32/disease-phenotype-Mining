<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recently developed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method has increased the possibilities for multiplex detection of gene copy number aberrations in a routine laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a novel robust method: the methylation-specific MLPA (MS-MLPA) that can detect changes in both CpG methylation as well as copy number of up to 40 chromosomal sequences in a simple reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In MS-MLPA, the ligation of MLPA probe oligonucleotides is combined with digestion of the genomic DNA-probe hybrid complexes with methylation-sensitive endonucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digestion of the genomic DNA-probe complex, rather than double-stranded genomic DNA, allowed the use of DNA derived from the formalin treated paraffin-embedded tissue samples, enabling retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To validate this novel method, we used MS-MLPA to detect aberrant methylation in DNA samples of patients with Prader-Willy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, Angelman</z:e> syndrome or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
