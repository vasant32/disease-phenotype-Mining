<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> syndromes caused by paternal and maternal deficiencies, respectively, in chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% of these patients have a large deletion of approximately 4 Mb extending from D15S9 (ML34) through D15S12 (IR10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the deletion breakpoints proximal to D15S9, three new polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed that showed observed heterozygosities of 60%-87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>D15S541 and D15S542 were isolated from YAC A124A3 containing the D15S18 (IR39) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>D15S543 was isolated from a cosmid cloned from the proximal right end of YAC 254B5 containing the D15S9 (ML34) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gene-centromere mapping of these markers, using a panel of ovarian <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratomas</z:hpo> of known meiotic origin, extended the genetic map of chromosome 15 by 2-3 cM toward the centromere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the more proximal S541/S542 markers on 53 Prader-Willi and 33 Angelman deletion patients indicated two classes of patients: 44% (35/80) of the informative patients were deleted for these markers (class I), while 56% (45/80) were not deleted (class II), with no difference between PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, D15S543 was deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative patients (13/48) or showed the presence of a single allele (in 35/48 patients), suggesting that this marker is deleted in the majority of PWS and AS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the presence of two common proximal deletion breakpoint regions in both Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> and are consistent with the same deletion mechanism being responsible for paternal and maternal deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One breakpoint region lies between D15S541/S542 and D15S543, with an additional breakpoint region being proximal to D15S541/S542 </plain></SENT>
