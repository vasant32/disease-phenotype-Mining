<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions of the 15q11q13 region are found in approximately 70% of AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletions are sub-classified into class I and class II based on their sizes of approximately 6.8 and approximately 6.0, respectively, with two different proximal breakpoints and a common distal breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Utilizing a chromosome 15-specific comparative genomic hybridization genomic microarray (array-CGH), we have identified, determined the deletion sizes, and mapped the breakpoints in a cohort of 44 cases, to relate those breakpoints to the genomic architecture and derive more precise genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly four patients of the 44 studied (9.1%) had novel and unusually large deletions, and are reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of very large deletions of 15q11q13 resulting in AS; the largest deletion being &gt;10.6 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These novel deletions involve three different distal breakpoints, two of which have been earlier shown to be involved in the generation of isodicentric 15q chromosomes (idic15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, precise determination of the deletion breakpoints reveals the presence of directly oriented low-copy repeats (LCRs) flanking the recurrent and novel breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The LCRs are adequate in size, orientation, and homology to enable abnormal recombination events leading to deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This genomic organization provides evidence for a common mechanism for the generation of both common and rare deletion types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger deletions result in a loss of several genes outside the common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>-Prader-Willi syndrome (AS-PWS) critical interval, and a more severe phenotype </plain></SENT>
