<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of the 6 patients had informative cytogenetic studies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with other reported cases of the origin of the chromosome 15 deletion in AS, suggest that deletion of the maternally contributed chromosome leads to the AS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in which a similar deletion of the paternally contributed chromosome 15 is observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In deletion cases, a parental gamete effect such as <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> may be the best model to explain why apparently identical 15q11-q13 deletions may develop the different phenotypes of AS or PWS </plain></SENT>
