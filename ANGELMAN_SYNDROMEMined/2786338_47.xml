<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phenotype-karyotype correlation did not show any obvious clinical differences between those with and those without the deletion and no clinical overlap between Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our survey suggests that 15q12 deletions are frequent in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> but presence of the deletion does not appear to distinguish different clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experience with the cytogenetic study of Prader-Willi syndrome predicts that considerable complexity will emerge between the presence of 15 chromosome abnormalities and clinical expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
