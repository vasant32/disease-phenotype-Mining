<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> are clinically distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> both mapping to chromosome region 15q11-q13, which are caused by a loss of function of paternally or maternally inherited genes in the region, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With clinical diagnosis often being difficult, particularly in infancy, confirmatory genetic diagnosis is essential to enable clinical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the latter is challenged by the complex genetics behind both disorders and the unmet need for characterised reference materials to aid accurate molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this in mind, a panel of six genotyping reference materials for Prader Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> was developed, which should be stable for many years and available to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnostic laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The panel comprises three Prader Willi syndrome materials (two with different paternal deletions, and one with maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD)) and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> materials (one with a maternal deletion, one with paternal UPD or an epigenetic imprinting centre defect, and one with a UBE3A point mutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was bulk-extracted from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines established from consenting patients, and freeze-dried as aliquots in glass ampoules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, 37 laboratories from 26 countries participated in a collaborative study to assess the suitability of the panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants evaluated the blinded, triplicate materials using their routine diagnostic methods against in-house controls or externally sourced uncertified reference materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The panel was established by the Expert Committee on Biological Standardization of the World Health Organization as the first International Genetic Reference Panel for Prader Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
