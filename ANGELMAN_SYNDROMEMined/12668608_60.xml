<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Parental submicroscopic genomic inversions have recently been demonstrated to be present in several genomic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These inversions are genomic polymorphisms that facilitate misalignment and abnormal recombination between flanking segmental duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (AS; MIM 105830) is associated with specific abnormalities of chromosome 15q11-q13, with about 70% of cases being mother-of-origin 4 Mb deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here evidence that some mothers of AS patients with deletions of the 15q11-q13 region have a heterozygous inversion involving the region that is deleted in the affected offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inversion was detected in the mothers of four of six AS cases with the breakpoint 2-3 (BP2/3) 15q11-q13 deletion, but not in seven mothers of AS due to paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have identified variable inversion breakpoints within BP segmental duplications in the inverted AS mothers, as well as in AS deleted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the BP2-BP3 region is inverted in the mouse draft genome sequence with respect to the human draft sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The BP2-BP3 chromosome 15q11-q13 inversion was detected in four of 44 subjects (9%) of the general population (P&lt;0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The BP2/3 inversion should be an intermediate estate that facilitates the occurrence of 15q11-q13 BP2/3 deletions in the offspring </plain></SENT>
