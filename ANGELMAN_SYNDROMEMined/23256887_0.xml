<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: More than 50 mutations in the UBE3A gene (E6-AP ubiquitin protein ligase gene) have been found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients with no deletion, no <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, and no imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We here describe a novel UBE3A frameshift mutation in two siblings who have inherited it from their asymptomatic mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite carrying the same UBE3A mutation, the proband shows a more severe phenotype whereas his sister shows a milder phenotype presenting the typical AS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized that the mutation Leu125Stop causes both severe and milder phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential mechanisms include: i) maybe the proband has an additional problem (genetic or environmental) besides the UBE3A mutation; ii) since the two siblings have different fathers, the UBE3A mutation is interacting with a different genetic variant in the proband that, by itself, does not cause problems but in combination with the UBE3A mutation causes the severe phenotype; iii) this UBE3A mutation alone can cause either typical AS or the severe clinical picture seen in the proband </plain></SENT>
