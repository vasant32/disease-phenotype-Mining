<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reaction cycle of HECT domain ubiquitin ligases consists of three steps: 1) binding of an E2 protein, 2) transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the HECT domain, and 3) transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the identification of a determinant that is specifically required for the last step of this cycle, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32503">phenylalanine residue</z:chebi> located four amino acids from the C terminus of most HECT domains, referred to here as the -4F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alteration of this residue in human E6AP and Saccharomyces cerevisae Rsp5p did not affect ubiquitin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51277">thioester</z:chebi> formation, but effectively blocked substrate ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alteration of the -4F to alanine with concomitant substitution of a nearby residue to phenylalanine only partially restored Rsp5p activity, indicating that precise spatial placement of this residue is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C-terminally extended E6AP and Rsp5p proteins were also defective for substrate ubiquitination, providing a likely biochemical understanding of a previously isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>-associated mutation of E6AP that alters the stop codon of an otherwise <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that the -4F may play a role in orienting ubiquitin when it is tethered to the HECT active site cysteine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may be necessary to allow for approach of the incoming lysine epsilon-amino group of the substrate </plain></SENT>
