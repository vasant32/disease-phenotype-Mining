<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 2 distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> caused primarily by deficiency of specific parental contributions at an imprinted domain within the chromosomal region 15q11.2-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, lack of paternal contribution leads to PWS either by paternal deletion (approximately 70%) or maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD; approximately 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cases of AS result from the lack of a maternal contribution from this same region by maternal deletion (approximately 70%) or by paternal UPD (approximately 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of allelic methylation differences at the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN) locus can differentiate the maternally and paternally inherited chromosome 15 and can be used as a diagnostic test for AS and PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">Sodium bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated genomic DNA was PCR-amplified for the SNRPN gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used pyrosequencing to individually quantify the resulting artificial C/T sequence variation at CpG sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anonymized DNA samples from PWS patients (n = 40), AS patients (n = 31), and controls (n = 81) were analyzed in a blinded fashion with 2 PCR and 3 pyrosequencing reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared results from the pyrosequencing assays with those obtained with a commonly used methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) diagnostic protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pyrosequencing assays had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and provided quantification of methylation at 12 CpG sites within the SNRPN locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The resulting diagnoses were 100% concordant with those obtained from the MS-PCR protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pyrosequencing is a rapid and robust method for quantitative methylation analysis of the SNRPN locus and can be used as a diagnostic test for PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
