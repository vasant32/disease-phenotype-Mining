<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review our experience of 21 years with PWS and AS that were confirmed with the genetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 13,875 patients recorded during the study period, 11 were diagnosed with PWS (18%), 7 males (63.6%) and 4 females (36.4%), with a mean age of 9.06 years (+/- 6.92, range: 0.68-21.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time of the follow up of this group was 3.83 years (+/- 4.03, range: 0.49-15.3), and the age at diagnosis was 4.4 years (+/- 6.84, range: 0.03-19.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Almost three quarters (72.7% of the PWS patients had a uniparental dysomy and 27.3% a paternal deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients (8%) were diagnosed with AS, 4 females (66.6%) and 2 males (33.4%), with a mean age of 14.65 years (+/- 11.89, range: 1.3-30.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time of follow up was 6.76 years (+/- 5.89,range: 0.16-15), and the age at diagnosis was 8.84 years (+/- 9.11, range: 1.10-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A maternal deletion was present in 83.3% of the AS patients and 16.7% had a maternal dysomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: As genetic advances are made these pathologies are confirmed before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike the data in the literature, in our series most patients diagnosed with PWS (72'3%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recent studies correlation genotype with phenotype, in PWS is more serious if it occurs a deletion and in SA is milder in the case of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Genetic studies must be performed in view of the established clinical symptoms: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001319'>neonatal hypotonia</z:hpo> of unknown cause in PWS and psychomotor deficits with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> features, particularly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, must be evaluated in AS to prevent diagnostic uncertainties, unnecessary complementary examinations and to provide early genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
