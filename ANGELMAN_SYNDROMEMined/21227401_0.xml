<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> relies on a combination of clinical suspicion and confirmatory genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory uses a standard methylation-sensitive PCR (MSP) to target the differentially methylated SNRPN gene to test for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient, a 27-month-old female, who lacked the classical clinical features of PWS, but had a molecular diagnosis of PWS by MSP by another laboratory, had repeat testing in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Testing by MSP in our laboratory also identified an apparent loss of the unmethylated paternal allele, consistent with a diagnosis of PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory testing using Southern blot analysis with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of methylation, detecting both the methylated maternal and unmethylated paternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate these discrepant results, we amplified and sequenced the SNRPN locus in this patient and identified a single nucleotide change within the binding site for the unmethylated DNA-specific primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate this nucleotide change led to allelic dropout in the MSP analysis, yielding the false-positive result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, MSP analysis using an alternate primer set that was developed by our laboratory detected both methylated and unmethylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings illustrate that allelic dropout due to the presence of rare polymorphisms can cause false-positive results in commonly used MSP assays and lead to molecular misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
