<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>About 70% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> have a common interstitial de novo microdeletion encompassing paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) loci D15S9 to D15S12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the non-deletion PWS patients and a small number of non-deletion AS patients have a maternal or paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) 15, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other chromosome 15 rearrangements and a few smaller atypical deletions, some of the latter being associated with an abnormal methylation pattern, are rarely found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis have both been used to diagnose PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we have evaluated, in a typical routine cytogenetic laboratory setting, the efficiency of a diagnostic strategy that starts with a FISH deletion assay using Alu-PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-amplified D15S10-positive yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 273A2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed FISH in 77 patients suspected of having PWS (n = 66) or AS (n = 11) and compared the results with those from classical cytogenetics and wherever possible with those from DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A FISH deletion was found in 16/66 patients from the PWS group and in 3/11 patients from the AS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One example of a centromere 15 co-hybridization performed in order to exclude cryptic translocations or inversions is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the PWS patients, 14 fulfilled Holm's criteria, but two did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis confirmed the common deletion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients screened by the D15S63 methylation test and in restriction fragment length polymorphism dosage blots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3/58 non-deletion patients, other chromosomal aberrations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the non-deleted group, 27 subjects (24 PWS, 3 AS) were tested molecularly, and three patients with an uniparental methylation pattern were found in the PWS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The other 24/27 subjects had neither a FISH deletion nor uniparental methylation, but two had other cytogenetic aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given that cytogenetic analysis is indispensable in most patients, we find that the FISH deletion assay with YAC 273A2 is an efficient first step for stepwise diagnostic testing and mutation-type analysis of patients suspected of having PWS or AS </plain></SENT>
