<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of 83 analyzed cells also contained an unidentified small marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using cosmid probes for SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB3 for the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> critical region were not present on the derived chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The child had some physical findings compatible with <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 8p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mother also was a balanced carrier for the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She also had 2/80 cells with an additional small marker chromosome, similar in size to the extra chromosome in the one cell of the propositus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH using an 8 paint did not show the reciprocal exchange on the der(15) but was demonstrated by using an 8p telomeric probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 18 months of age the child has some manifestations of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Earlier diagnosis may have been masked by the 8p- phenotype, or related to difficulty in diagnosing AS in infants </plain></SENT>
