<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Parenting stress was investigated in mothers with a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> or Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which are genetically related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Mothers of 24 children with AS and 23 children with PWS (2-12 years) completed the Nijmegen Parenting Stress Index-Short, Developmental Behaviour Checklist, and Vineland Screener 0-12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Parenting stress was high for 58% of AS and 26% of PWS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For both syndromes, no relationship existed with the child's gender, age, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In PWS there was no effect on level of functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, more mothers with a child with AS perceived high parenting stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When children showed low levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> this difference was contained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when children exhibited severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e>, parenting stress was the same for both syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In AS professional family support is essential, since parenting is stressful for many mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In PWS, this is especially the case when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> are present </plain></SENT>
