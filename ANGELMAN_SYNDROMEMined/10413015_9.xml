<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 10 of them the diagnostic criteria indicated by Williams were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 134 patients we were able to diagnose one 15-year-old patient with AS, on the basis of the EEG findings, even though the typical clinical features of the syndrome were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the diagnosis of AS was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in 10 patients and by methylation analysis in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AS is very likely when both typical clinical and EEG findings are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it must be considered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients affected by severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, when the EEG pattern is sufficiently indicative, and FISH and/or molecular analysis should be performed even in absence of typical clinical signs </plain></SENT>
