<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific methylation at D15S63 (PW71) has routinely been used as a diagnostic indicator of PWS and AS in DNA samples derived from peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive variation in allele-specific methylation patterns, however, has been observed at this site in different tissues, but the frequency or mechanism of this variation has remained uncharacterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Herein, we have investigated the cellular basis of variation in methylation patterns at four sites of allelic methylation near SNRPN by using DNA samples derived from a panel of primary T lymphocyte clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interclonal variability was observed at three of these sites, including the diagnostic PW71 site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in allele-specific methylation patterns occurred at a frequency of about one change in 50% of the cells every 22-25 doublings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, stable allele-specific methylation was observed in these clonal populations at exon 1 of SNRPN and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptor locus on the inactive X chromosome, suggesting that methylation at some CpG sites is more faithfully maintained than others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> at PW71 was not an artifact of cell culture because the absence of allelic methylation was also observed in about 20% of the alleles in unstimulated peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that variation in allele-specific methylation at PW71 and other sites in the PWS/AS region appear to depend on the clonal complexity of the particular tissue and on the lack of strict maintenance of methylation within clones </plain></SENT>
