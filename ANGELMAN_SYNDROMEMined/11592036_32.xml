<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Establishment of the paternal state of the region requires the PWS imprinting center (PWS-IC); establishment of the maternal state requires the AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">Cytosine</z:chebi> methylation of the PWS-IC, which occurs during oogenesis in mice, occurs only after fertilization in humans, so this modification cannot be the gametic imprint for the PWS/AS region in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that the PWS-IC shows parent-specific complementary patterns of H3 lysine 9 (Lys9) and H3 lysine 4 (Lys4) methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>H3 Lys9 is methylated on the maternal copy of the PWS-IC, and H3 Lys4 is methylated on the paternal copy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that H3 Lys9 methylation is a candidate maternal gametic imprint for this region, and we show how changes in chromatin packaging during the life cycle of mammals provide a means of erasing such an imprint in the male germline </plain></SENT>
