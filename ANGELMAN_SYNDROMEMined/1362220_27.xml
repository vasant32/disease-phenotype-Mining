<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apparently, most patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic mechanism underlying familial AS has remained enigmatic for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, evidence has been emerging suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> of a detectable or undetectable defect in a gene or genes at 15q11-13, subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present report describes an unusually large pedigree with segregation of AS through maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and apparent asymptomatic transmission through several male ancestors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion and paternal disomy at 15q11-13 were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the genetic defect is still located in this region, as we obtained a maximum lod score of 5.40 for linkage to the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> receptor locus GABRB3 and the anonymous DNA marker D15S10, which have been mapped within or adjacent to the AS critical region at 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of the pedigree allowed calculation of an odds ratio in favour of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> of 9.25 x 10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This family illustrates the necessity of extensive pedigree analysis when considering recurrence risks for relatives of AS patients, those without detectable deletion or disomy in particular </plain></SENT>
