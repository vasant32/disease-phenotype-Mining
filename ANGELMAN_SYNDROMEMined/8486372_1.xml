<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using YAC cloning and restriction enzyme analysis, we have found that IR4-3R detects five related DNA sequences, which are spread over 700 kb within the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> chromosome region in 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RsaI and StyI polymorphisms, which were described previously, are associated with the most proximal copy of IR4-3R and are in strong linkage disequilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IR4-3R represents the third DNA sequence family that has been identified in 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
