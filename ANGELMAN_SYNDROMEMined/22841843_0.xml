<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the circadian aspect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> in AS and an effective treatment for the disorder have yet to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We elucidated the sleep-wake patterns of AS patients and its relationship to the serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels of 15 AS patients were measured every 4h for one day and the values were compared with those of age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined the effectiveness of the oral administration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> on AS patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1561871,C0877792" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circadian rhythm sleep disorders</z:e> (CRSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of eight of the 15 AS patients had CRSD (irregular sleep-wake type, n=4; free-running type n=2; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">delayed sleep phase</z:e> type, n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The nighttime serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels of the AS patients were significantly lower than those of the controls at the measured time points during the night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The nocturnal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels were comparably low both in AS patients with and without CRSD except for the cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">delayed sleep phase</z:e> type, which showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but delayed peak <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six out of eight CRSD cases were given a daily dose of 1mg of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> between 18:00 and 19:00 regularly for three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After receiving the treatment, the sleep patterns improved in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of CRSD in AS patients, which may be related to abnormal serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> profiles </plain></SENT>
