<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently we have identified a novel maternally expressed gene, ATP10C, that encodes a putative aminophospholipid translocase within this critical region, 200 kb distal to UBE3A in an imprinted domain on human chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATP10C, with UBE3A, displayed tissue-specific imprinting with predominant expression of the maternal allele in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that the mouse homologue, Atp10c/pfatp, showed tissue-specific maternal expression in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, which overlapped the region of imprinted Ube3a expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the imprinted transcript of Atp10c in the specific region of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> may be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> including AS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
