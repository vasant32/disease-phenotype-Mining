<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using mib(hi904) zebrafish, we reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and a down-regulation of Î³-aminobutyric acid (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) signaling pathway genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A transcriptome analysis also identified differential expression pattern of genes related to Notch signaling and neurodevelopment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we selected nine of these genes (her4.2, hes5, bhlhb5, hoxa5a, hoxb5b, dmbx1a, dbx1a, nxph1, and plxnd1) and performed a more thorough analysis of expression using conventional polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transgenic reporter fish (Gfap:GFP and Dlx5a-6a:GFP) were used to assess early brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of many of these genes was prominent throughout key structures of the developing mib(hi904) zebrafish brain including, but not limited to, the pallium, ventral thalamus, and optic tectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain expression of Dlx5a-6a and Gfap was also reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these expression studies indicate a general down-regulation of Notch signaling genes necessary for proper brain development and suggest that these mutant fish could provide valuable insights into neurological conditions, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, associated with ubiquitin E3 ligase mutation </plain></SENT>
