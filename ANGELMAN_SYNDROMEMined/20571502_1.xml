<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBE3A is known to function as both an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) and a coactivator for steroid receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many ubiquitin targets, as well as interacting partners, of UBE3A have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the pathogenesis of AS, and how deficiency of maternal UBE3A can upset cellular homeostasis, remains vague </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a genome-wide microarray analysis on the maternal Ube3a-deficient (Ube3a(m-/p+)) AS mouse to search for genes affected in the absence of Ube3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed 64 differentially expressed transcripts (7 upregulated and 57 downregulated) showing more than 1.5-fold differences in expression (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis shows that these genes are implicated in three major networks associated with cell signaling, <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system development and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, we validated the differential expression of genes (Fgf7, Glra1, Mc1r, Nr4a2, Slc5a7 and Epha6) that show functional relevance to AS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also show that the protein level of melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) and nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 2 (Nr4a2) in the AS mice cerebellum is decreased relative to that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this finding, expression of small-interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> that targets Ube3a in P19 cells caused downregulation of Mc1r and Nr4a2, whereas overexpression of Ube3a results in the upregulation of Mc1r and Nr4a2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observation help in providing insights into the genesis of neurodevelopmental phenotype of AS and highlight specific area for future research </plain></SENT>
