<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>South African ty-pos OCA individuals occur with two distinct phenotypes, with or without darkly pigmented patches (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ephelides</z:e>, or dendritic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">freckles</z:e>) on exposed areas of the skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These phenotypes are concordant within families, suggesting that there may be more than one mutation at the ty-pos OCA locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies carried out in 41 families have shown linkage between markers in the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PWS/AS) region on chromosome 15q11-q13 and ty-pos OCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis showed no obligatory crossovers between the alleles at the D15S12 locus and ty-pos OCA, suggesting that the D15S12 locus is very close to or part of the disease locus, which is postulated to be the human homologue, P, of the mouse pink-eyed dilution gene, p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike caucasoid "ty-pos OCA" individuals, negroid ty-pos OCA individuals do not show any evidence of locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies of allelic association between the polymorphic alleles detected at the D15S12 locus and ephelus status suggest that there was a single major mutation giving rise to ty-pos OCA without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ephelides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There may, however, be two major mutations causing ty-pos OCA with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016689" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ephelides</z:e>, one associated with D15S12 allele 1 and the other associated with D15S12 allele 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two loci, GABRA5 and D15S24, flanking D15S12, are both hypervariable, and many different haplotypes were observed with the alleles at the three loci on both ty-pos OCA-associated chromosomes and "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" chromosomes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
