<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SOURCES: The authors carried out a bibliographic review on each syndrome involved, correlating and characterizing the neurological manifestations, as well as describing genetic mechanisms and identifying biological markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: The authors were able to confirm that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e> Sydrome is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> resulting from the mutation of the MECP2 gene and clinical variations can be explained by different mutations in this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> has four genetic mechanisms responsible for phenotypic variations and different risks of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Fragile-X syndrome</z:e>, the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> is related to the number of trinucleotide repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Different genetic mechanisms of the three syndromes are responsible for clinical variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By identifying the biological markers, the diagnosis will be performed earlier and it will be possible to identify new subtle expressions of the disease </plain></SENT>
