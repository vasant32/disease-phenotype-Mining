<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal plasma ghrelin and PYY levels compared with controls have been reported for subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) which is characterized by infantile <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002033'>poor suck</z:hpo> reflex and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> and marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied gene expression of ghrelin, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> YY, and their receptors (i.e., GHS-R1a, GHS-R1b, and NPY2R) in six different brain regions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, visual cortex, pons, medulla, and hypothalamus) obtained from three subjects with PWS, two individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and six controls to determine if expression of these genes is detectable in different regions of the brain in subjects with and without PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, expression of these genes using RT-PCR was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and no obvious differences were seen in their pattern of expression between subjects with or without PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional studies including quantitative gene expression measurements will be required to further evaluate the role of these genes in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">eating disorder</z:e> seen in PWS </plain></SENT>
