<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sleep concerns are common in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, with 20-80% of individuals having a decreased sleep need and/or abnormal sleep-wake cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of these sleep behaviours on parental sleep and stress is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Through the use of standardised questionnaires, wrist actigraphy and polysomnography, we defined the sleep behaviours of 15 children/adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and the association of the child/adolescents sleep behaviours on parental sleep behaviours and parental stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both children/adolescents and their parents exhibited over 1â€ƒh of wake time after sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and fragmented sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prolonged sleep latency in the child was associated with parent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> and daytime sleepiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, variability in child total sleep time was associated with parental stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep in children/adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> was associated with poor parental sleep and higher parental stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further work is warranted to identify the underlying causes of the poor sleep, and to relate these findings to daytime functioning, behaviour and the family unit </plain></SENT>
