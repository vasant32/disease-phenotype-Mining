<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of PWS and AS in children with moderate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002187'>profound mental retardation</z:hpo> in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The screening began with methylation studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enrolled cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If methylation results were positive, Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine whether deletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, or imprinting mutation was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1053 children with moderate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002187'>profound mental retardation</z:hpo>, we identified three cases of AS (0.28%) and one case of PWS (0.09%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PWS is lower than AS in school children with moderate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002187'>profound mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greater number of AS identified than that of PWS is most likely a reflection of more <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> for AS than for PWS </plain></SENT>
