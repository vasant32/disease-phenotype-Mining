<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report an electroclinical and cytogenetic study of 4 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795810" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="WHS">Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, we observed a stereotyped EEG and clinical picture characterized by generalized or unilateral myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> followed later by brief atypical absences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Electrographically, these were accompanied by a sequence of centroparietal or parietotemporal sharp waves; high-voltage wave with a superimposed spike becoming unusual spike-wave complexes, often elicited by eye closure; burst of diffuse spikes and waves; and frequent jerks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This electroclinical pattern is very similar to the one described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> in which a defect in GABAA receptor function has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the genes encoding the GABAA receptor subunit have been mapped to the p12-p13 bands of chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even though the deletion in these cases does not encompass the 4p12-p13 region, we suggest that the electroclinical picture common to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WHS</z:e> and AS might represent a characteristic type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> linked to a common genetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
