<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular defects underlying AS are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, including large maternal deletions of chromosome 15q11-q13 (70%), paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of chromosome 15 (5%), imprinting mutations (rare), and mutations in the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase gene UBE3A (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although patients with UBE3A mutations have a wide spectrum of neurological phenotypes, their features are usually milder than AS patients with deletions of 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a chromosomal engineering strategy, we generated mutant mice with a 1.6-Mb chromosomal deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3, which inactivated the Ube3a and Gabrb3 genes and deleted the Atp10a gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homozygous deletion mutant mice died in the perinatal period due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> resulting from the null mutation in Gabrb3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice with a maternal deletion (m-/p+) were viable and did not have any obvious developmental defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of the maternal and paternal deletion mice confirmed that the Ube3a gene is maternally expressed in brain, and showed that the Atp10a and Gabrb3 genes are biallelically expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain sub-regions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maternal (m-/p+), but not paternal (m+/p-), deletion mice had increased spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extensive behavioral analyses revealed significant impairment in motor function, learning and memory tasks, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>-related measures assayed in the light-dark box in maternal deletion but not paternal deletion mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) recording in newborns revealed that maternal deletion pups emitted significantly more USVs than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increased USV in maternal deletion mice suggests abnormal signaling behavior between mothers and pups that may reflect abnormal communication behaviors in human AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, mutant mice with a maternal deletion from Ube3a to Gabrb3 provide an AS mouse model that is molecularly more similar to the contiguous gene deletion form of AS in humans than mice with Ube3a mutation alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These mice will be valuable for future comparative studies to mice with maternal deficiency of Ube3a alone </plain></SENT>
