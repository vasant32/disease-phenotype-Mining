<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first family has probable familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> with a maternally imprinted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 5 year old girl with this disorder has a 14 year old brother and an 11 year old male cousin who have less typical clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA microsatellite analysis has shown that the three share a common segment of the same grandpaternal chromosome 15q11-q13 that overlaps with UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The child with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> has an additional maternal recombination 5' to UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second family is a mother and son both of whom have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> but no other features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> despite an extensive DNA deletion on the telomeric side of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, the two families identify a region between loci D15S210 and D15S986 which forms part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A new microsatellite (D15S1234) is described which can be used in place of the LS6-1 marker at locus D15S113 </plain></SENT>
