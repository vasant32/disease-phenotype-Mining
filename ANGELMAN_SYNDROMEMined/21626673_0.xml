<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It almost exclusively affects females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The face of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> is said to resemble that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, although there seems little objective support for this impression and it is not a concept with universal support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observational and anthropometric study was carried out to define the key facial characteristics of females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> and to evaluate whether any changes of significance occur with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven affected Caucasian females, from 2 to 20 years of age, were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five of them had a documented mutation in MECP2 while the remaining two fulfilled the clinical criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> and had been diagnosed by an experienced clinician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few unusual facial features were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> facial measurements were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range although head circumference tended to fall below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range with increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of measurements was constant over time, with the exception of increased facial width in the under 3-year-old girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The face of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> does not demonstrate marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>prognathism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>wide mouth</z:hpo>, spaced teeth or striking <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> have similar clinical, neurological, and behavioral phenotypes, they do not appear to share similar facial features </plain></SENT>
