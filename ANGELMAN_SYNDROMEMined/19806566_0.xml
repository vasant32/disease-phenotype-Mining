<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methylation specific-PCR (MS-PCR) was used for primary diagnosis of 16 clinically suspected AS cases, and linkage analysis by short tandem repeat (STR) was applied to detect the molecular genetic defect in the nuclear families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this study, 10 AS patients were identified by MS-PCR, and 9 of them with maternal deletion in chromosome 15q11-q13, 1 with imprinting defect in chromosome 15q11-q13 were confirmed by STR linkage analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most of the AS patients could be confirmed by MS-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And STR linkage analysis can detect the molecular defect of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is very important for disease diagnosis, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis to perform the related genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
