<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Classical lesions, including deletion, paternal disomy, or epigenetic mutation, are confirmatory of AS diagnoses in 80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-function mutations of the UBE3A gene have been identified in approximately 8% of AS cases, failing to account for the remaining patient population, and there appears to be a higher prevalence of mutations in familial than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened UBE3A in 45 index cases of AS without obvious 15q11-13 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological mutations were identified in 3/6 (50%) familial and 4/39 (&gt;10%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By combining our data with those of the literature, we demonstrate statistically that the frequency of UBE3A mutations is significantly higher in the familial than <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> subsets of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates that an independent molecular mechanism or 'phenocopy' exists for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> (RS), caused by mutations of the MECP2 gene, and patients with deletions of 22q13.3 --&gt; qter, have overlapping clinical features with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We screened 24 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AS cases without detectable UBE3A mutations for mutations of MECP2, but found none </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A separate cohort of 43 atypical patients with features common to AS and RS, in whom 15q11-13 lesions and 22q13.3 --&gt; qter deletion had been ruled out, were also screened for MECP2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One male patient was mosaic for a frameshift mutation of this gene (previously reported) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While MECP2 mutations can cause a phenotype reminiscent of AS in rare cases, they fail to account for the excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients with a definitive clinical diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
