<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by inactivation of the UBE3A gene in the brain due to various abnormalities of the 15q11-q13 chromosome inherited from the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, virtual absence of speech, motor impairment, and a particular behavioral phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies of cortical, electromyographic and cerebellar electrophysiology in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and a mouse model revealed unique rhythmic neurophysiological activities in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex, and muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The oscillatory patterns may be linked to molecular pathophysiology of the syndrome involving dysregulation of synaptic neurotransmission through UBE3A-related modulation of functional GABAA receptor complexes </plain></SENT>
