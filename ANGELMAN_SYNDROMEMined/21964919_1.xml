<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three resulting phenotypes have so far been reported: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>-like condition, Christianson syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> with tau deposition, with each characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic behaviour</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypothesizing that a <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-hydrogen exchanger 6 deficiency would most likely disrupt the endosomal-lysosomal system of neurons, we examined Slc9a6 knockout mice with tissue staining and related techniques commonly used to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085078" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lysosomal storage disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a result, we found that <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-hydrogen exchanger 6 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> leads to abnormal accumulation of GM2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> and unesterified cholesterol within late endosomes and lysosomes of neurons in selective brain regions, most notably the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, the CA3 and CA4 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and some areas of cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these select neuronal populations, histochemical staining for Î²-hexosaminidase activity, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of GM2 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi>, was undetectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroaxonal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> similar to that observed in lysosomal disease was observed in the cerebellum and was accompanied by a marked and progressive loss of Purkinje cells, particularly in those lacking the expression of Zebrin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On behavioural testing, Slc9a6 knockout mice displayed a discrete clinical phenotype attributable to motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these findings show that <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-hydrogen exchanger 6 loss of function in the Slc9a6-targeted mouse model leads to compromise of endosomal-lysosomal function similar to lysosomal disease and to conspicuous neuronal abnormalities in specific brain regions, which in concert could provide a unified explanation for the cellular and clinical phenotypes in humans with SLC9A6 mutations </plain></SENT>
