<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Inv dup(15) is the most common supernumerary marker chromosome in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanism responsible for this frequent chromosome rearrangement, we characterized the breakpoints in 18 individuals with small inv dup(15) chromosomes [i.e., negative for the Prader-Willi (PWS)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> critical region] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since two proximal breakpoint regions ("hotspots") for PWS/AS deletions have been previously identified with the most proximal 15q markers D15S541/S542 and S543, we hypothesized that formation of the small inv dup(15) chromosomes may involve one or both of these breakpoint hotspots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By analysis with S542, both breakpoint regions were found to be involved in approximately equal frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ten cases, the inv dup(15) was negative for S542 (Class I), indicating the breakpoint is between the centromere and the most proximal marker on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the other eight cases, S542 was positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization (5/5) and/or microsatellite analysis (7/7), but S543 was negative (Class II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These two breakpoint regions appear to be the same as the two proximal breakpoints reported in the common PWS/AS deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To initiate cloning and sequencing of the Class II breakpoint, the gap in the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig between S541/S542 and S543 was filled by screening the CEPH YAC and mega-YAC libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>YACs 705C2 and 368H3 were found to bridge this gap, and therefore contain the more distal breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding of consistent breakpoints in small inv dup(15), like that found in PWS/AS deletions, provides strong evidence for hotspots for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003220'>chromosome breakage</z:hpo> in this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, our results show that two extra copies (tetrasomy) of the region from 15cen to the euchromatic region containing S542 are present in individuals with Class II breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since most individuals carrying a small inv dup(15) are phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the euchromatin region included in the small inv dup(15) chromosomes does not appear to contain genes with clinically significant dosage effects </plain></SENT>
