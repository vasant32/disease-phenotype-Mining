<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The imprinted domain on human chromosome 15 consists of two oppositely imprinted gene clusters, which are under the coordinated control of an imprinting center (IC) at the 5' end of the SNURF-SNRPN gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One gene cluster spans the centromeric part of this domain and contains several genes that are transcribed from the paternal chromosome only (MKRN3, MAGEL2, NDN, SNURF-SNRPN, HBII-13, HBII-85 and HBII-52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apart from the HBII small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (snoRNA) genes, each of these genes is associated with a 5' differentially methylated region (DMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second gene cluster maps to the telomeric part of the imprinted domain and contains two genes (UBE3A and ATP10C), which in some tissues are preferentially expressed from the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So far, no DMR has been identified at these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, maternal-only expression of UBE3A may be regulated indirectly through a paternally expressed antisense transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report here that a processed antisense transcript of UBE3A starts at the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SNURF-SNRPN sense/UBE3A antisense transcription unit spans more than 460 kb and contains at least 148 exons, including the previously identified IPW exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It serves as the host for the previously identified HBII-13, HBII-85 and HBII-52 snoRNAs as well as for four additional snoRNAs (HBII-436, HBII-437, HBII-438A and HBII-438B), newly identified in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of those snoRNAs are encoded within introns of this large transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis indicates that most if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these snoRNAs are indeed expressed by processing from these introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As we have not obtained any evidence for other genes in this region, which, from the mouse data appears to be critical for the neonatal Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype, a lack of these snoRNAs may be causally involved in this disease </plain></SENT>
