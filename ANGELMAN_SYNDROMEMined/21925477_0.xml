<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we investigated how temperature variation in plate-based qPCR instruments influences qPCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Temperature variation was measured by amplicon melting analysis as a convenient means to assess well-to-well differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple technical replicates of several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi>-based qPCR assays allowed correlation of relative well temperature to quantification cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that inadequate template denaturation results in an inverse correlation and requires increasing the denaturation temperature, adding a DNA destabilizing agent, or pretreating with a restriction enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, inadequate primer annealing results in a direct correlation and requires lowering the annealing temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were found in 18 of 25 assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The critical nature of temperature-dependent effects was shown in a blinded study of 29 patients for the diagnosis of Prader-Willy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, where eight diagnoses were incorrect unless temperature-dependent effects were controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A method to detect temperature-dependent effects by pairwise comparisons of replicates in routine experiments is presented and applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systematic temperature errors in qPCR instruments can be recognized and their effects eliminated when high precision is required in quantitative genetic diagnostics and critical complementary DNA analyses </plain></SENT>
