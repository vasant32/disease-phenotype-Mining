<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: DNA methylation analysis currently requires complex multistep procedures based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> conversion of unmethylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> or on methylation-sensitive endonucleases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate DNA methylation analysis, we have developed a quantitative 1-step assay for DNA methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The assay is based on combining methylation-sensitive FastDigest(R) endonuclease digestion and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in a single reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first step consists of DNA digestion, followed by endonuclease inactivation and qPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of DNA methylation is evaluated by comparing the quantification cycles of a reaction containing a methylation-sensitive endonuclease with the reaction of a sham mixture containing no endonuclease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control reactions interrogating an unmethylated locus allow the detection and correction of artifacts caused by endonuclease inhibitors, while simultaneously permitting copy number assessment of the locus of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With our novel approach, we correctly diagnosed the imprinting disorders Prader-Willi syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> in 35 individuals by measuring methylation levels and copy numbers for the SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N) promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that the proposed correction model significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increases the assay's accuracy with low-quality DNA, allowing analysis of DNA samples with decreased digestibility, as is often the case in retrospective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our novel DNA methylation assay reduces both the hands-on time and errors caused by handling and pipetting and allows methylation analyses to be completed within 90 min after DNA extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined with its precision and reliability, these features make the assay well suited for diagnostic procedures as well as high-throughput analyses </plain></SENT>
