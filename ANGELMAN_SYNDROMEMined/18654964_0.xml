<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A representative sample of 240 physicians was drawn from 70 medical centers from the Madrid Autonomous region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participation rate was 71.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire included sociodemographic data, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> symptomatology using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 18.8% of the total sample met <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> diagnosis, with higher frequency among women (23%) compared to men (9.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same pattern appeared for early morning awakening and daytime impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of logistic regression analyses showed that, after controlling for sociodemographic variables, this relationship between gender and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> remained significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results indicate that women scored significantly higher than men on global sleep quality and on its components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A PSQI global score = or &gt; 5 is an optimal cut-off score for distinguishing good sleepers from subjects with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following this criteria, 35.4% of physicians had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e>, with a significant higher prevalence among women (40% vs. 25.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data indicates that the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> is high among primary care physicians, especially among women </plain></SENT>
