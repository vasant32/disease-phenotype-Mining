<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using multiple-channel electromyography, we studied a lower limb and an upper limb isometric postural task in 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and 18 unimpaired control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both tasks were associated with synchronous bursts of activity at frequencies of 6-8 s(-1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> recorded muscles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and none of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This pattern was not altered by extra-loading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalogram recorded during the upper limb task showed no change in relation to the task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Burst-locked back-averaging of the electroencephalogram showed no spiking before or during the bursts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various physiological and pathological rhythmic muscle activities have been proposed to be a manifestation of oscillations in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and it has been suggested that such oscillations may have a role in the processing of motor commands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the rhythmic muscle bursting activity associated with maintaining posture in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> is not clear, although it could be consistent with cerebellar Purkinje cell dysfunction, either as a pathological feature or as an adaptive process to overcome deficits in motor coordination </plain></SENT>
