<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A loss of contiguous genes shows a high phenotypical variability and at the same time it is significant for genetic prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1) Variability of clinical features depends on the size and pathogenetic mechanism of underlying deletion; 2) Dysmorphic face features are of a characteristic type and can be somatoscopically recognized; 3) Heart defects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> are common features of microdeletion syndromes; 4) New mutations represent the most common etiology of microdeletions; only 1 to 10% of mutations are transmitted from the parental gonadal mosaics, from the balanced translocation or from the same microdeletion in parents; 5) Recurrence risk is low, but it may be as high as 50% in individual cases of inherited mutation; 6) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> is high and the responsible genes can be located at different chromosomes (e.g. <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>Di George syndrome</z:mp> due to mutation on 22q or 10q) and can also result from microdeletion or point mutation (in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Shprintzen syndrome</z:e> 70% represent microdeletion and 30% point mutation at 22q11, in Rubinstein-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265251" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Taybi syndrome</z:e> 10% cases result from microdeletions and 90% from point mutations); 7) Population incidence of microdeletions is high (1:4000 to 1:30,000) because their etiologic mechanism is related to the common unequal crossing over; 8) Imprinting plays a role in some cases, e.g. Prader-Willi syndrome results from nullisomy of paternal 15q12 chromosome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> is related to that of maternal 15q12 chromosome; 9) Prenatal prevention of the high risk familial chromosomal rearrangements is feasible since the 12th gestation week </plain></SENT>
