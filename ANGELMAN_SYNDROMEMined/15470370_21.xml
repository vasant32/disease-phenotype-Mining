<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the phenotypic and behavioral variability detected in 49 patients with different classes of deletions and nine patients with UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of the SNRPN-SNURF gene and by microsatellite profiling of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no major phenotypic differences between the two main classes (BP1-BP3; BP2-BP3) of AS deletion patients, except for the absence of vocalization, more prevalent in patients with BP1-BP3 deletions, and for the age of sitting without support, which was lower in patients with BP2-BP3 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that gene deletions (NIPA1, NIPA2, CYF1P1, GCP5) mapped to the region between breakpoints BP1 and BP2 may be involved in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech impairment</z:hpo>, since <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BP1-BP3 deletion patients showed complete absence of vocalization, while 38.1% of the BP2-BP3 deletion patients were able to pronounce syllabic sounds, with doubtful meaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to UPD patients, deletion patients presented a higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> (73.9% del x 22.2% UPD) and <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> (73.3% del x 28.57% UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, children with UPD showed better physical growth, fewer or no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and higher cognitive skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of their milder or less typical phenotype, AS may remain undiagnosed, leading to an overall underdiagnosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
