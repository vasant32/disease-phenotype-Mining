<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In neurons, the paternal allele of UBE3A is intact but epigenetically silenced, raising the possibility that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> could be treated by activating this silenced allele to restore functional UBE3A protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using an unbiased, high-content screen in primary cortical neurons from mice, we identify twelve <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50276">topoisomerase I inhibitors</z:chebi> and four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase II inhibitors</z:chebi> that unsilence the paternal Ube3a allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These drugs included topotecan, irinotecan, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50223">dexrazoxane</z:chebi> (ICRF-187) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At nanomolar concentrations, topotecan upregulated catalytically active UBE3A in neurons from maternal Ube3a-null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Topotecan concomitantly downregulated expression of the Ube3a antisense transcript that overlaps the paternal copy of Ube3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that topotecan unsilences Ube3a in cis by reducing transcription of an imprinted antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When administered in vivo, topotecan unsilenced the paternal Ube3a allele in several regions of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, including neurons in the hippocampus, neocortex, striatum, cerebellum and spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paternal expression of Ube3a remained elevated in a subset of spinal cord neurons for at least 12 â€‰weeks after cessation of topotecan treatment, indicating that transient topoisomerase inhibition can have enduring effects on gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although potential off-target effects remain to be investigated, our findings suggest a therapeutic strategy for reactivating the functional but dormant allele of Ube3a in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
