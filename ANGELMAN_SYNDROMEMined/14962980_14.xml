<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cluster of imprinted genes on human chromosome 15q11-q13 (the PWS/AS domain) and its ortholog on mouse chromosome 7c is believed to be regulated by an imprinting control center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although minideletions in this region in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients revealed that two elements, shortest deletion regions of overlap in AS families and PWS families (AS-SRO and PWS-SRO), respectively, constitute the IC, the molecular mechanism that governs this regional control remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand how this imprinting center works, a mouse model was sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The striking similarity between the human and mouse sequences allowed the generation of a minitransgene (AS-SMP) composed of AS-SRO and the Snrpn minimal promoter (SMP) the mouse ortholog of PWS-SRO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This minitransgene carries out, in a highly reliable and reproducible manner, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> steps of the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to decipher the molecular mechanism of the imprinting process, we generated and tested for imprinting five minitransgenes based on AS-SMP, in which various parts of the 160 bp SMP were deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experiments revealed a set of five cis elements that carry out the various steps of the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This set includes: (i). two copies of a de novo methylation signal (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi>) that establish the maternal imprint during oogenesis; (ii). an allele discrimination signal that establishes the paternal imprint; and (iii). two elements that act together to maintain the paternal imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two functionally redundant sets of the five elements were found on the respective endogenous mouse sequence explaining the previously published contradictory results of targeted deletion experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together with the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five elements bind specific proteins that are presumably the factors acting in trans in the imprinting process, our observations set the stage for a comprehensive study of the molecular mechanism involved in the control of the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
