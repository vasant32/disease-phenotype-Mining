<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>Microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are also common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Developmental delays are first noted at around age six months; however, the unique clinical features of AS do not become manifest until after age one year, and it can take several years before the correct clinical diagnosis is obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of AS rests on a combination of clinical features and molecular genetic testing and/or cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria for AS have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the 15q11.2-q13 chromosome region detects approximately 78% of individuals with AS, including those with a deletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), or an imprinting defect (ID); fewer than 1% of individuals have a cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangement (i.e., translocation or inversion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>UBE3A sequence analysis detects mutations in an additional approximately 11% of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence analysis) identifies alterations in approximately 90% of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining 10% of individuals with classic phenotypic features of AS have the disorder as a result of an as-yet unidentified genetic mechanism and thus are not amenable to diagnostic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Routine management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Individualization and flexibility in school settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="35" ids="35717">Sedatives</z:chebi> for nighttime wakefulness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thoraco-lumbar jackets and/or surgical intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prevention of secondary complications: Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are at risk for medication overtreatment because <z:mp ids='MP_0001388'>movement abnormalities</z:mp> can be mistaken for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and because <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> can persist even when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Sedating agents such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazines</z:chebi> or other <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptic</z:chebi> drugs can cause negative side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: Annual clinical examination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of older children for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> associated with an excessive appetite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Agents/circumstances to avoid: Carbamezapine, vigabatrin and tigabine as they may exacerbate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: AS is caused by disruption of maternally imprinted UBE3A located within the 15q11.2-q13 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The risk to sibs of a proband depends on the genetic mechanism leading to the loss of UBE3A function: typically less than 1% risk for probands with a deletion or UPD, and as high as 50% for probands with an ID or a mutation of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Members of the mother's extended family are also at increased risk when an ID or a UBE3A mutation is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetically visible chromosome rearrangements may be inherited but are usually de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible when the underlying genetic mechanism is a deletion, UPD, an ID, a UBE3A mutation, or a chromosome rearrangement </plain></SENT>
