<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the present time, there is no effective treatment for AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mouse lines with loss of maternal Ube3a (Ube3a) recapitulate multiple aspects of the clinical AS profile, including <z:mp ids='MP_0001405'>impaired motor coordination</z:mp>, learning deficits, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, these genetic mouse models could serve as behavioral screens for preclinical efficacy testing, a critical component of drug discovery for AS intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the severity and consistency of abnormal phenotypes reported in Ube3a mice can vary, dependent upon age and background strain, which is problematic for the detection of beneficial drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As part of an ongoing AS drug discovery initiative, we characterized Ube3a mice on either a 129S7/SvEvBrd-Hprt (129) or C57BL/6J (B6) background across a range of functional domains and ages to identify reproducible and sufficiently large phenotypes suitable for screening therapeutic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from the study showed that Ube3a mice have significant deficits in acquisition and reversal learning in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings also demonstrated that Ube3a mice exhibit motor impairment in a rotarod task, <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002757'>reduced rearing</z:mp> and marble-burying, and deficient fear conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these profiles of abnormal phenotypes can provide behavioral targets for evaluating effects of novel therapeutic strategies relevant to AS </plain></SENT>
