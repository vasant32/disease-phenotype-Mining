<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our study, 49 unrelated patients with classic AS phenotypes were confirmed by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) analysis, short tandem repeat linkage analysis, and mutation screening of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the Chinese AS patients, 83.7% (41/49) had deletions on maternal chromosome 15q11.2-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, imprinting defects, and UBE3A gene mutations each accounted for 4.1% (2/49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two AS patients were confirmed by MS-PCR analysis, but the pathogenic mechanism was unknown because their parents' samples were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 2 described UBE3A gene mutations, i.e., p.Pro400His (c.1199C&gt;A) and p.Asp563Gly (c.1688A&gt;G), the latter has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutation transmission analysis showed that the p.Pro400His and p.Asp563Gly mutations originated from asymptomatic mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with the maternal deletion showed AS clinical manifestations that were consistent with other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> (36.7%, 11/30) was lower than that in the Caucasian population (approximately 80%), but similar to that of the Japanese population (34.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> in AS may vary among different populations </plain></SENT>
