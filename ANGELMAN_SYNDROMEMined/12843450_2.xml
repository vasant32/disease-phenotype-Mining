<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosome replication banding studies show that homologous regions on a pair of autosomes generally replicate at the same time in S phase (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Izumikawa et al. first observed that this was not the case for the imprinted chromosomal region 15q11-q13 (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This observation has been confirmed in other replication banding studies (3) as well by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) replication assay (4-9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter technique has also been used to observe DNA replication asynchrony in association with allelic inactivation of genes such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the cytokine, interleukin 2 (10,11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter genes are not imprinted but display random silencing of an allele in individual cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In imprinted regions, DNA replication was generally observed to occur earlier on the paternal homologue (5,6,9,12,13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patterns of allele-specific replication in the cells of Prader- Willi (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> patients, however, have generally been synchronous (5,6,14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an investigation of the kinetics of allele-specific replication timing in the GABRB3/A5 cluster on 15q11-13 revealed that cells from PWS and AS have lost the strict replication timing observed on the parental chromosomes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells (12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggested the requirement of a biparental contribution for the regulation of replication asynchrony and lead to the hypothesis that allelic cross-talk, perhaps via pairing of homologous chromosomes, might play a role in the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
