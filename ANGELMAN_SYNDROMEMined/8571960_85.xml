<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N) gene is one of a gene family that encode proteins involved in pre-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> splicing and maps to the smallest deletion region involved in the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) within chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paternal only expression of SNRPN has previously been demonstrated by use of cell lines from PWS patients (maternal allele only) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> patients (paternal allele only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have characterized two previously unidentified 5' exons of the SNRPN gene and demonstrate that exons -1 and 0 are included in the full-length transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This gene is expressed in a wide range of somatic tissues and at high, approximately equal levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the first exon of SNRPN (exon -1) and the putative transcription start site are embedded within a CpG island </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This CpG island is extensively methylated on the repressed maternal allele and is unmethylated on the expressed paternal allele, in a wide range of fetal and adult somatic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This provides a quick and highly reliable diagnostic assay for PWS and AS, which is based on DNA-methylation analysis that has been tested on &gt; 100 patients in a variety of tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, several CpG sites approximately 22 kb downstream of the transcription start site in intron 5 are preferentially methylated on the expressed paternal allele in somatic tissues and male germ cells, whereas these same sites are unmethylated in fetal oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with a key role for DNA methylation in the imprinted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and subsequent gene expression of the human SNRPN gene </plain></SENT>
