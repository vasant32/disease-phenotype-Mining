<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe an approach to simultaneous analysis of multiple CpG islands, where methylation-specific oligonucleotide probes are joined by ligation and subsequently amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) when hybridized in juxtaposition on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specificity of the ligation reaction is achieved by (i) using probes containing CpGpCpG (for methylated sequences) or CpApCpA (for unmethylated sequences) at the 3' ends, (ii) including three or more probes for each target, and (iii) using a thermostable DNA ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The external probes carry universal tails to allow amplification of multiple ligation products using a common primer pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As proof-of-principle applications, we established duplex assays to examine the FMR1 promoter in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">fragile-X syndrome</z:e> and the SNRPN promoter in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and a multiplex assay to simultaneously detect hypermethylation of seven genes (ID4, APC, RASSF1A, CDH1, ESR1, HIN1 and TWIST1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> cell lines and tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that ligation of oligonucleotide probes hybridized to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated DNA is a simple and cost-effective approach to analysis of CpG methylation </plain></SENT>
