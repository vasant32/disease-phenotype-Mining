<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a yeast artificial chromosome restriction map and two key patients we have determined that the shortest region of deletion overlap in the Prader-Willi syndrome comprises 320 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region includes the anonymous DNA marker PW71 (D15S63) and the gene for the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N (SNRPN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SNRPN gene maps 130 kb distal to PW71 and is transcribed from centromere to telomere </plain></SENT>
