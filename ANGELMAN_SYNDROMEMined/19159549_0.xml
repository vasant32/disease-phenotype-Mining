<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To verify the sensitivity and reliability of methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) and to develop a simple, accurate, reliability method of genetic diagnosis for AS and PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 4 suspected AS patients, 2 suspected PWS patients, 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons, and 2 molecular biologically proven positive controls (1 AS patient and 1 PWS patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA was extracted and purified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MS-MLPA was used to detect the methylation of the CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> and the copy number in the 15q-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of MS-MLPA were confirmed by MSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three cases with maternal deletion on 15q11-q13 region and one case with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) or imprinting center defect in 15q11-q13 region were found in the 4 suspected AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One PWS case was found to be with paternal deletion in 15q11-q13 region and the other with paternal deletion in 15q11-q13 region or UPD or imprinting center defect in 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MS-MLPA is a simple, rapid, accurate, and reliable method of genetic test </plain></SENT>
