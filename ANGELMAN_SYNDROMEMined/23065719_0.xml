<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a unique phenotype of cognitive delay, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic behavior</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002317'>gait instability</z:hpo> segregating in three separate sibships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We initiated genome-wide mapping in two sibships using Affymetrix 10K SNP Mapping Arrays and identified a homozygous 8.2 Mb region on chromosome 15 common to five affected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used exome sequencing of two affected children to assess coding sequence variants within the mapped interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four novel homozygous exome variants were shared between the two patients; however, only two variants localized to the mapped interval on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A third sibship in an Ohio Amish deme narrowed the mapped interval to 2.6 Mb and excluded one of the two novel homozygous exome variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining variant, a missense change in HERC2 (c.1781C&gt;T, p.Pro594Leu), occurs in a highly conserved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32874">proline residue</z:chebi> within an RCC1-like functional domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional studies of truncated HERC2 in adherent <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium cells suggest that the p.Pro594Leu variant induces protein aggregation and leads to decreased HERC2 abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic correlation with the mouse Herc1 and Herc2 mutants as well as the phenotypic overlap with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> provide further evidence that pathogenic changes in HERC2 are associated with nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
