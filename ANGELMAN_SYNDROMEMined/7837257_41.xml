<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 7 year old girl with intrachromosomal triplication 46,XX,-15,+der(15)(pter--&gt;q13::q13--&gt;q11::q11--&gt;qter) resulting in tetrasomy of 15q11-q13 is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridisation confirmed that the tetrasomic region included the entire segment normally deleted in Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients, and breakpoints were similar to those reported in two tandem duplications of 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The middle repeat was inverted, suggesting a possible origin through an inverted duplication intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis showed that the rearrangement was of maternal origin and involved both maternal homologues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings included multiple minor anomalies (a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> over the glabella, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000286'>epicanthic folds</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000494'>downward slanting palpebral fissures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> of the upper lids, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo>, a broad and bulbous tip of the nose, and small hands and feet), motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder, and limited verbal abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, immunological examination disclosed a selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall phenotype did not clearly resemble that of cases with tetrasomy 15pter-q13 associated with an extra inv dup(15)(pter--&gt;q13:q13--&gt;pter) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter aberration causes more severe mental deficit and intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, but less marked phenotypic alterations, although some overlap in mild facial dysmorphic features is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A number of features common to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were also observed in the patient </plain></SENT>
