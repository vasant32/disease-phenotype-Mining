<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, 158 nuclear families with probands suspected of having either Prader Willi (PWS) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> were analyzed with polymorphic DNA markers from the 15q11-13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cases have been re-evaluated with the probe PW71 (D15S63), which detects parent-of-origin-specific alleles after digestion with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (HpaII) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Application of PW71 to DNA samples isolated from leucocytes, confirmed the deletions and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> detected earlier by marker analysis, and resolved 50% of the previously uninformative (n = 18) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PW71 and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resolved cases, disomies of the 15q11-13 region were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of PW71 increased the percentage of disomies detected in our PWS and AS patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Almost 50% of our PWS patients and 17% of the AS patients showed a disomy of maternal or paternal origin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA of first trimester chorionic villi and of fibroblast cultures was not suitable for analysis with PW71 because of different methylation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The application of PW71 is recommended for the diagnosis of the PWS and AS, with respect to DNA samples from blood </plain></SENT>
