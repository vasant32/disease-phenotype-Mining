<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As both recurrent genomic disorders and chromosomal non-disjunction are known to be associated with specific unusual patterns of recombination, we hypothesized a possible link between PRDM9 ZF variation and susceptibility to microdeletion syndromes and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the PRDM9 ZF domain in 271 parents of patients with de novo microdeletions of known parental origin (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e>, the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome, Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams-Beuren syndrome</z:e>), and in 61 parents of individuals with a supernumerary X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared PRDM9 ZF genotype frequencies between parents in whose germ line the de novo rearrangement occurred and their spouses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed a significantly increased frequency (p = 0.006) of PRDM9 variants in parents who transmitted de novo 7q11.23 deletions to their offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that certain PRDM9 alleles may be associated with an increased susceptibility to recurrent 7q11.23 microdeletions that cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams-Beuren syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, as the majority of parents who transmitted a de novo microdeletion/supernumerary X chromosome to their offspring have the common AA genotype, we conclude that none of the rearrangements we have studied are dependent on specific non-A PRDM9 alleles </plain></SENT>
