<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region encompasses three GABAA receptor subunit genes (beta3, alpha5, and gamma3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristic phenotype of AS is <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo>, tremulousness, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>jerky movements</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> in 11 AS patients, aged 3 to 28 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for chromosome 15, 8 had a &gt;3 Mb deletion, and 1 had a microdeletion involving loci D15S10, D15S113, and GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients exhibited quasicontinuous rhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> mainly involving hands and face, accompanied by rhythmic 5- to 10-Hz electroencephalographic (EEG) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electromyographic bursts lasted 35 +/- 13 msec and had a frequency of 11 +/- 2.4 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Burst-locked EEG averaging in 5 patients, generated a premyoclonus transient preceding the burst by 19 +/- 5 msec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A cortical spread pattern of myoclonic cortical activity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients also demonstrated myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001312'>giant somatosensory evoked potentials</z:hpo> or C-reflex were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The silent period following motor evoked potentials was shortened by 70%, indicating motor cortex hyperexcitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment with piracetam in 5 patients significantly improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that spontaneous, rhythmic, fast-bursting cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> is a prominent feature of AS </plain></SENT>
