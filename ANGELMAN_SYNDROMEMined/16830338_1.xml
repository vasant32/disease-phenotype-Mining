<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report on a 16-month-old patient who has a ring SMC(15) with two copies of the segment 15p11.1-q14 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She exhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000750'>speech delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000160'>microstomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, and other mild dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ring was present in 22% of her peripheral blood lymphocyte cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH study revealed that the ring was derived from chromosome 15, and had neither telomere sequence nor satellite III paracentromeric DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It had alpha satellite DNA, and two copies of the segment 15q11.2 to CTD 2125J1 (at 15q14, 2.2 Mbp telomeric of the common breakpoint 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ring-containing cells had four copies of 15p11.1-q14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ring can be described as r(15)(::p11.1 --&gt; q14::q14 --&gt; p11.1::) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Southern-blot analysis of the methylation pattern in the PW/AS critical region showed biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, and the ring was maternally derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This patient's phenotype was comparable to ring SMC(15) patients with three copies of the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PWS/AS) critical region </plain></SENT>
