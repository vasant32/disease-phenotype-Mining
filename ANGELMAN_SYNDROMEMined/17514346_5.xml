<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some cases of PWS and AS are caused by microdeletions near the SNRPN gene that disrupt a regulatory element termed the imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The IC has two functional components; an element at the promoter of SNRPN involved in PWS (PWS-IC) and an element 35 kilobases (kb) upstream of SNRPN involved in AS (AS-IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further understand the function of the IC, we sought to create a mouse model for AS-IC mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have generated two deletions at a location analogous to that of the human AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neither deletion produced an imprinting defect as indicated by DNA methylation and gene expression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that no elements critical for AS-IC function in mouse reside within the 12.8-kb deleted region and suggest that the specific location of the AS-IC is not conserved between human and mouse </plain></SENT>
