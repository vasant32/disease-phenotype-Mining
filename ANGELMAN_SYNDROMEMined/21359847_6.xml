<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classical Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> deletion is flanked by either of the proximal BP1 or BP2 breakpoints and the distal BP3 breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The larger Type I deletions are flanked by BP1 and BP3 in both Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those with this deletion are reported to have a more severe phenotype than individuals with either Type II deletions (BP2-BP3) or <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BP1-BP2 region spans approximately 500 kb and contains four evolutionarily conserved genes that are not imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reports of mutations or disturbed expression of these genes appear to impact behavioral and neurological function in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, reports of deletions and duplications flanked by BP1 and BP2 suggest an association with speech and motor delays, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present a large cohort of subjects with copy number alteration of BP1 to BP2 with common phenotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, motor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023012" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">language delays</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo>, which were present in both cytogenetic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parental studies demonstrated phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carriers in several instances, and mildly affected carriers in others, complicating phenotypic association and/or causality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible explanations for these results include <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>reduced penetrance</z:hpo>, altered gene dosage on a particular genetic background, or a susceptibility region as reported for other areas of the genome implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and behavior disturbances </plain></SENT>
