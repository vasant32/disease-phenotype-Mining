<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They occur most commonly with paternal and maternal 15q11-13 deletions, but also with maternal and paternal disomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both syndromes have also occurred more rarely in association with smaller deletions seemingly causing <z:mp ids='MP_0003787'>abnormal imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A putative mouse model of PWS, occurring with maternal duplication (partial maternal disomy) for the homologous region, has been described in a previous paper but, although a second imprinting effect that could have provided a mouse model of AS was found, it appeared to be associated with a slightly different region of the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence that the same region is in fact involved and further demonstrate that animals with paternal duplication for the region exhibit characteristics of AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mouse model of AS is, therefore, strongly indicated </plain></SENT>
