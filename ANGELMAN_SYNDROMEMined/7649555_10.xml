<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients with classical features of Angel-man syndrome (AS) and one with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) had unbalanced reciprocal translocations involving the chromosome 15 proximal long arm and the telomeric region of chromosomes 7, 8 and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for the detection of chromosome 15(q11-13) deletions (with probes from the PWS/AS region) and to define the involvement of the telomere in the derivative chromosomes (with library probes and telomere-specific probes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 15(q11-13) region was not deleted in one patient but was deleted in the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The telomere on the derivative chromosomes 7, 8 and 10 was deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, these are true reciprocal translocations in which there has been loss of the small satellited reciprocal chromosome (15) fragment </plain></SENT>
