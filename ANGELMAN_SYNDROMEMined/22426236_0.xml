<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Absence of paternally expressed genes in this region cause Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), whereas absence of the maternally expressed UBE3A gene causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, duplications and triplications of this region are also associated with distinct clinical features, indicating that the overexpression of genes within the PWS/ASCR can also lead to distinct phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maternally inherited increases in copy number generally lead to a more severe phenotype do than paternally inherited increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a real-time methylation-sensitive PCR (Q-MSP) assay that quantifies methylation at the promoter of the differentially methylated SNRPN gene located within the PWS/ASCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Q-MSP can detect both PWS and AS, as well as determine the parent of origin for the allele that carries the PWS/ASCR gains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Q-MSP requires only a small amount of DNA, is amenable to high-throughput analysis, and can be used in clinical testing as a reflex test to determine the parent of origin after identification of a gain of this region on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
