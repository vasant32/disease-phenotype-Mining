<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PWS-IC on the maternal allele is methylated and inactivated by an 880-bp sequence (AS-IC) located 30 kb upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this communication, we report the identification of 7 cis acting elements within AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elements: DMR, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi>, 2 OCTA sequences, SOX, E1, and E2 bind specific proteins that form at least 2 protein complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using variants of an imprinted transgene, mutated at the elements each at a time, we show that (i) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 elements are involved in the methylation and inactivation of the maternal PWS-IC; (ii) the OCTA and SOX elements that bind a protein complex, and the E1 and E2 elements, function in establishing the primary imprint that constitutes an active and unmethylated AS-IC in the oocyte; (iii) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> and DMR bind a multiprotein complex that may facilitate interaction between AS-IC and PWS-IC, mediating the inactivation in cis of PWS-IC; and (iv) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 elements participate in maintaining an unmethylated PWS-IC in the oocyte, which is essential for its maternal methylation later in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the above observations imply that the cis acting elements on AS-IC display diverse functions in establishing the imprints at both AS-IC and PWS-IC in the oocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A postulated epigenetic mark imprints the PWS-IC in the oocyte and maintains its inactive status during development before it is translated into maternal methylation </plain></SENT>
