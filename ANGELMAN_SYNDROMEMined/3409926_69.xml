<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The age at time of the first EEG ranged from 11 months to 11 years with the majority under 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six children had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at the time of the first EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One or more of the following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent rhythmic 4-6/s activities reaching more than 200 microV not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prolonged runs of rhythmic 2-3/s activity (200-500 microV) often more prominent anteriorly, sometimes associated with discharges (ill-defined spike/wave complexes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spikes mixed with 3-4/s components usually more than 200 microV mainly posteriorly and facilitated by, or only seen with, eye closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two and sometimes three of these EEG features could be present in the same record particularly at a young age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The appearance of discharges mixed with slow components on eye closure was the commonest finding seen at some stage in 17 patients (aged from 11 months to over 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EEG features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> appear to be sufficiently characteristic to help identify patients at an early age before the clinical features become obvious and at a time when genetic counselling may be particularly important </plain></SENT>
