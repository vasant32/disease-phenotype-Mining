<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Communicative functioning of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> (n = 109) was compared with individuals with mixed etiologies (n = 117) using the Verbal Behaviour Assessment Scale (VerBAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within-group analyses of those with AS revealed that the communicative function of manding was significantly more developed than tacting and echoing, and that tacting was significantly more developed than echoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Low mean total VerBAS-scores were found with individuals who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> medication, and with those who had profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disabilities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the comparison group, the function of manding was significantly more developed than both tacting and echoing, while tacting did not differ from echoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between-groups analyses revealed that individuals with AS had significantly lower scores on tacting and echoing, but not on manding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The overall pattern of VerBAS scores for individuals with AS suggests a possible communicative phenotype </plain></SENT>
