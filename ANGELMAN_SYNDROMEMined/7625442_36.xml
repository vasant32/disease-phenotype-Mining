<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe 47 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> from Belgium and the Netherlands, including the anamnestic data, the clinical and the behavioral attributes at different ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of AS is most distinct between the ages of 2-16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients of this age group show at least 8 of the major characteristics (bursts of laughter, happy disposition, <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> behaviour, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>macrostomia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010808'>tongue protrusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>mandibular prognathism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000687'>widely spaced teeth</z:hpo>, stiff and puppetlike movements, typical stature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002136'>wide based gait</z:hpo>) beside the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and (almost) absence of speech, which is a universal trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis in infants is based on only a limited number of clinical characteristics or on anamnestic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, if these occur in combination, they are indicative of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In older patients, the diagnosis may be hampered in part because of the changing behavioral characteristics and the decreasing frequency of fits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other manifestations, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, may become more pronounced with age </plain></SENT>
