<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine: 1) If a 15q11-13 deletion was transmitted from a female with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> to her fetus, and 2) If the UBE3A gene was functionally imprinted in fetal eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individuals were genotyped by microsatellite analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation imprints were assessed by Southern blot analysis and methylation-specific PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression was analyzed by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mother and fetus inherited large deletions of maternal 15q11-13 and demonstrated paternal-only DNA methylation imprints along 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>UBE3A was paternally expressed in eye tissue from the fetus with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We show that females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> are fully capable of reproduction and that UBE3A is not imprinted in fetal eye </plain></SENT>
