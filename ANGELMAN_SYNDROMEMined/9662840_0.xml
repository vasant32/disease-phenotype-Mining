<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis of these pathologies can be accomplished by several techniques: DNA polymorphism (microsatellite) analysis, cytogenetic techniques of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation test by Southern blot (SB), with the latter being the most reliable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new technique, based on the study of methylation through treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26709">sodium bisulphite</z:chebi> and subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated this technique, comparing the results with those previously obtained by SB in a group of patients suspected of having PWS or AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from 70 patients with suspected PWS or AS was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation testing by SB was carried out using the probe PW71B labeled with radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For methylation testing by PCR the DNA was treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26709">sodium bisulphite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and PCR preformed using specific primers for the maternal and paternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 70 patients studied by PCR, 45 were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 17 and 8 showed altered molecular patterns that were compatible with PWS and AS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concordance with the results obtained previously with SB was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the reliability of this new technique is very good and it has advantages compared to SB, since it requires a smaller quantity of DNA and can be applied for diagnosis in newborns </plain></SENT>
