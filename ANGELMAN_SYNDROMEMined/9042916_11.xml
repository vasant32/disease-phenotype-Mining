<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deletions are exclusively of maternal origin, and a few cases of paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 15 have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter finding indicates that AS is caused by the absence of a maternal contribution to the imprinted 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Failure to inherit a paternal 15q11-q13 contribution results in the clinically distinct disorder of Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases of AS resulting from translocations or pericentric inversions have been observed to be associated with deletions, and there have been no confirmed reports of balanced rearrangements in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report the first such case involving a paracentric inversion with a breakpoint located approximately 25 kb proximal to the reference marker D15S10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This inversion has been inherited from a phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No deletion is evident by molecular analysis in this case, by use of cloned fragments mapped to within approximately 1 kb of the inversion breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses are discussed to explain the relationship between the inversion and the AS phenotype </plain></SENT>
