<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recently developed methodology-primed in situ labeling (PRINS)-can be used in place of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to diagnose microdeletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of PRINS in the diagnosis of microdeletions, we studied groups of patients with Prader Willi/Angelman (PWS/AS) syndrome and DiGeorge/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>/VCFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results obtained by PRINS were then confirmed with the results obtained with FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oligonucleotide primers specific for SNRPN and GABRB3 were used for PWS/AS syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>/VCFS, the primers used were DGCR2/TUPLE1 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Labeling patterns obtained by PRINS and FISH were analyzed and scored under a fluorescence microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects served as controls and were used for standardization of the PRINS protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 20 study patients were involved: 10 PWS/AS and 10 DGS/VCFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of the 10 patients referred with the clinical diagnosis of PWS/AS showed absence of labeling for SNRPN and GABRB3 on one chromosome 15, confirming deletion of the two loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 6 of the 10 patients referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>/VCFS showed deletion for the DGCR2/TUPLE1 loci on one chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients and controls had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patterns for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the loci as indicated by FISH and PRINS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concordant FISH and PRINS results were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls studied </plain></SENT>
