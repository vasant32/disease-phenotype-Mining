<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of expression of imprinted, paternally expressed genes has been implicated in PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the number of imprinted genes that contribute to PWS, and the range over which the imprinting signal acts to silence one copy of the gene in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify additional imprinted genes that could contribute to the PWS phenotype and to understand the regional control of imprinting in 15q11-q13, we have constructed an imprinted transcript map of the PWS-AS deletion interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The imprinting status of 22 expressed sequence tags derived from the radiation-hybrid human transcript maps or physical maps was determined in a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay and correlated with the position of the transcripts on the physical map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize to an approximately 1.5-Mb domain surrounding the SNRPN-associated imprinting center, which already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other tested new transcripts in the deletion region were expressed from both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A domain of exclusive paternal expression surrounding the imprinting center suggests strong regional control of the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study provides the means for further investigation of additional genes that cause or modify the phenotypes associated with rearrangements of 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
