<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> of the PWS/AS domain is regulated through a bipartite cis-acting imprinting center (PWS-IC/AS-IC) within and upstream of the SNRPN promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that two Rb-binding protein-related genes, Rbbp1/Arid4a and Rbbp1l1/Arid4b, are involved in the regulation of imprinting of the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recovered these two genes from gene trap mutagenesis selecting for altered expression of an Snrpn-EGFP fusion gene strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RBBP1/ARID4A is an Rb-binding protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RBBP1/ARID4A interacts with RBBP1L1/ARID4B and with the Snrpn promoter, implying that both are part of a protein complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further elucidate their roles on regulation of imprinting, we deleted the Rbbp1/Arid4a and Rbbp1l1/Arid4b genes in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined homozygous deficiency for Rbbp1/Arid4a and heterozygous deficiency for Rbbp1l1/Arid4b altered epigenetic modifications at the PWS-IC with reduced trimethylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H4K20 and H3K9 and reduced DNA methylation, changing the maternal allele toward a more paternal epigenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, mutations of Rbbp1/Arid4a, Rbbp1l1/Arid4b, or Rb suppressed an AS imprinting defect caused by a mutation at the AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data identify Rbbp1/Arid4a and Rbbp1l1/Arid4b as new members of epigenetic complexes regulating <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> at the PWS/AS domain </plain></SENT>
