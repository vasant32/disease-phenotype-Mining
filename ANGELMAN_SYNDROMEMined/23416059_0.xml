<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS is related to deficient maternal UBE3A gene expression caused either by chromosomal deletions, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, molecular defects of the imprinted 15q11-q13 critical region or by loss of function mutations in the maternally inherited UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, screening UBE3A was performed in 43 patients who were referred for AS but whom previous molecular diagnostic tests failed to provide a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two causative mutations - one of them novel - and four polymorphic variants one of which is also novel were revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of 7 patients disclosed defects in other genes involved in clinical phenotypes mimicking AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A typical EEG pattern and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> prompt for AS investigation while wide genetic screening should be applied to help resolution of the complex phenotypes characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
