<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A human imprinted domain at 14q32 contains two co-expressed and reciprocally imprinted genes, DLK1 and GTL2, which are expressed from the paternally and maternally inherited alleles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that another imprinted locus, on human 15q11-q13, contains a large number of tandemly repeated C/D small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> genes (or C/D snoRNAs) only expressed from the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the region downstream from the GTL2 gene is also characterized by a transcription unit spanning many repeated intron-encoded C/D snoRNA genes, most of them arranged into two tandem arrays of 31 and 9 copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, these snoRNAs depart from previously reported rRNA or snRNA methylation guides by their tissue-specific expression and by their lack of complementarity to rRNA or snRNA within their sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the orthologous region in the mouse shows that the previously reported maternally expressed Rian gene, located downstream of Gtl2 on the distal 12 chromosome, encodes at least nine C/D snoRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through a systematic search in rodents, we could identify other C/D snoRNA genes in this domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> snoRNAs identified on mouse distal 12 are brain-specific and only expressed from the maternally inherited allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The human imprinted 14q32 domain therefore shares common genomic features with the imprinted 15q11-q13 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This link between tandemly repeated C/D snoRNA genes and <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> suggests a role for these snoRNAs and/or their host non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> genes in the evolution and/or mechanism of the epigenetic imprinting process </plain></SENT>
