<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using probes within and flanking the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region (PWASCR) confirmed the triplication in the abnormal 15 homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inv dup(15) was dicentric, positive for IR39d which maps proximal to the PWASCR, but was negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the PWASCR FISH probes used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results using polymorphic microsatellite repeats confirmed that the additional material in the trip(15) was maternal in origin and included several PWASCR loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of two de novo abnormalities involving the proximal region of 15q suggests a linked mechanism of origin </plain></SENT>
