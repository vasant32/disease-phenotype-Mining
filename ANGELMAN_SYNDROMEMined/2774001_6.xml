<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes of both parents appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow karyotype analysis carried out on lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the child and her parents confirmed the presence of a de novo 15 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The estimated size of the deleted segment ranged from 6.1-9.5% of chromosome 15 (approximately 6-9.3 million base pairs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parental origin of the deleted chromosome could not be resolved by flow cytometry, but cytogenetic evidence suggested that it was derived from the smaller chromosome 15 homologue in the mother </plain></SENT>
