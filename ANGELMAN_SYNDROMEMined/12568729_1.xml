<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are caused by loss of gene function of the imprinted genes including Snrpn within a 2 Mb domain on chromosome 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on microdeletions in PWS and AS patients, a 4.3 sequence around Snrpn promoter/exon 1, together with a 880 bp sequence upstream to Snrpn, are believed to encompass an imprinting control center for the entire 2 Mb domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously characterized the mouse Snrpn minimal promoter and a 7 bp element (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>) within it, which is required for its activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the human Snrpn minimal promoter sequence, which is comprised of a 71 bp upstream sequence and 51 bp of exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SBE</z:e>, which has been shown to be critical for mouse promoter activity, is also found in the human sequence and absolutely required for promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation of this element, like in the mouse, prevents the binding of a protein factor and abolishes promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the 5' end of exon 1 must contain cis elements that support promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the 3' end of exon 1 appears to repress promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This sequence specifically binds a protein factor which presumably exerts a repressory effect on the promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Methylation of this sequence prevents the binding of this protein </plain></SENT>
