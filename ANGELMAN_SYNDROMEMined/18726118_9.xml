<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human chromosome 15q11-13 and the syntenic region of mouse chromosome 7 contain multiple imprinted genes necessary for proper neurodevelopment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to imprinting, paternal 15q11-13 deficiencies lead to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) while maternal 15q11-13 deficiencies cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved in parental imprinting of this locus are conserved between human and mouse, yet inconsistencies exist in reports of imprinting of the maternally expressed gene Atp10a/ATP10A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excess maternal 15q11-13 dosage often leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism-spectrum disorder</z:hpo> therefore further investigation to characterize the true imprinting status of ATP10A in humans was warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined allelic expression of ATP10A transcript in 16 control brain samples, and found that 10/16 exhibited biallelic expression while only 6/16 showed monoallelic expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the expectation for a maternally expressed imprinted gene, quantitative RT-PCR revealed significantly reduced ATP10A transcript in Prader-Willi syndrome brains with two maternal chromosomes due to <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (PWS UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a PWS UPD brain sample with monoallelic ATP10A expression demonstrated that monoallelic expression can be independent of imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of factors that may influence allelic ATP10A expression status revealed that gender has a major affect, as females were significantly more likely to have monoallelic ATP10A expression than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regulatory sequences were also examined, and a promoter polymorphism that disrupts binding of the transcription factor Sp1 also potentially contributes to allelic expression differences in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that monoallelic expression of human ATP10A is variable in the population and is influenced by both gender and common genetic variation </plain></SENT>
