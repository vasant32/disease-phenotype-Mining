<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Those with the syndrome have a predisposition toward apparent happiness and paroxysms of laughter, and this finding helps distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> from other conditions involving severe developmental handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accurate diagnosis rests on a combination of clinical criteria and molecular and/or cytogenetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of parent-specific DNA methylation imprints in the critical 15q11.2-q13 genomic region identifies 75-80% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals with the syndrome, including those with cytogenetic deletions, imprinting center defects and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining group, UBE3A sequence analysis identifies an additional percentage of patients, but 5-10% will remain who appear to have the major clinical phenotypic features but do not have any identifiable genetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic counseling for recurrence risk is complicated because multiple genetic mechanisms can disrupt the UBE3A gene, and there is also a unique <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern associated with UBE3A imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> is a prototypical developmental syndrome due to its remarkable behavioral phenotype and because UBE3A is so crucial to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> synaptic function and neural plasticity </plain></SENT>
