<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Deregulation of the activity of the ubiquitin ligase E6AP (UBE3A) is well recognised to contribute to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ubiquitin ligase HERC2, encoded by the HERC2 gene is thought to be a key regulator of E6AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a combination of autozygosity mapping and linkage analysis, we studied an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> with some phenotypic similarities to AS, found among the Old Order Amish </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our molecular investigation identified a mutation in HERC2 associated with the disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We establish that the encoded mutant HERC2 protein has a reduced half-life compared with its <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterpart, which is associated with a significant reduction in HERC2 levels in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data implicate a model in which disruption of HERC2 function relates to a reduction in E6AP activity resulting in neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting a previously unrecognised role of HERC2 in the pathogenesis of AS </plain></SENT>
