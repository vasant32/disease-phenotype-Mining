<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 14 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> out of a total of 17 patients with a genetic diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were seen at the Department of Pediatric Neurology at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2005 to March 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen (9 males and 5 females) subjects (82.3%) were diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types were generalized tonic-clonic (n=9, 27%) and myoclonic (n=9, 27%), followed by atonic (n=8, 24%), atypical absence (n=4, 12%) and complex partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (n=3, 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most commonly prescribed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (AED) was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA, n=12, 86%), followed by lamotrigine (LTG, n=9, 64%), and topiramate (n=8, 57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to questionnaires that determined whether each AED was efficacious or not, VPA had the highest response rate and LTG was associated with the highest rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> exacerbation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was achieved in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Partial control was achieved in 7 patients, while one patient was not controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> is observed in the great majority of AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may have early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and is often refractory to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are few reports about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study will be helpful in understanding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS in Korea </plain></SENT>
