<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a neurodevelopmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> that maps to 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary phenotypes are attributable to loss of expression of imprinted UBE3A gene within this region which can arise by means of a number of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to make a genetic diagnosis and to analyze the clinical features in suspected patients with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 17 cases were diagnosed clinically as AS including 7 males and 10 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 8 months to 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic diagnosis was made by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR), linkage analysis by short tandem repeat (STR) and chromosome karyotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the international diagnostic criteria of AS, the related characteristic clinical features of the AS patients with deletion of 15q11-13 were analyzed and summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Deletion of 15q11-13 was confirmed by genetic diagnosis in 17 AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No abnormal findings were observed when they were born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>Developmental delay</z:hpo> in movement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech impairments</z:hpo> and happy disposition were observed in 100% (17/17) AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And the severe speech deficit was much easier and more obvious to observe than movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>About 80% (14/17) - 90% (15/17) AS patients presented frequent clinical characteristics, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> could only be observed in 35% (6/17) AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regarding the associated findings of AS, 41% (7/17) - 77% (13/17) AS patients could be observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005469'>flat occiput</z:hpo>/occipital groove, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>prognathia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>wide mouth</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000687'>wide-spaced teeth</z:hpo>, frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo>, excessive mouth behaviors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmented skin</z:hpo>, light hair compared to parents, flexed arm position during ambulation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep disorder</z:e> etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These features occurred at a higher frequency in those patients of &gt; 2 years old group than that of &lt; 2 years old group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The testing strategies of MS-PCR and STR linkage analysis combined with chromosome karyotype analysis were appropriate to the molecular genetic diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In our analysis of clinical features, there was a lower rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>small head circumference</z:hpo> (HC) in 35% patients compared with 80% patients in Caucasian with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, which might be attributable to the phenotypic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in different races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>And the birth history, movement and speech development and main clinical features of the Chinese AS patients were consistent with those of other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Clinical analysis in patients of different age groups showed that findings associated with AS would be more easily observed with the age increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Genetic diagnosis should be performed in clinically suspected AS patients </plain></SENT>
