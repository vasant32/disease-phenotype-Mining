<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proposita was diagnosed clinically as having severe PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies revealed loss of the paternal methylation pattern at locus D15S63 and a deletion encompassing the loci from at least D15S10 to D15S97 of paternal chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH studies confirmed the deletion of 15q11q13 region and the presence of two telomeres on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposita's father, the father's sister and their mother are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carriers of the same balanced translocation t(11;15)(q25;q13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> we would expect that if the father's sister were to give birth to a child with the same unbalanced translocation as the proband, it would be affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date, a similar familial unbalanced translocation due to loss of the small chromosome15 derivative has not been described </plain></SENT>
