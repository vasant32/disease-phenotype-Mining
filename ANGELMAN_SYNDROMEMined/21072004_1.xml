<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are different mechanisms leading to AS: maternal microdeletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, defects in a putative imprinting centre, mutations of the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (UBE3A) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, some of suspected cases of AS are still scored negative to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the latter mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown that a proportion of negative cases bear large deletions overlapping one or more exons of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These deletions are difficult to detect by conventional gene-scanning methods due to the masking effect by the non-deleted allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have used for the first time multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and comparative multiplex dosage analysis (CMDA) to search for large deletions affecting the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we identified a novel causative deletion involving exon 8 in an affected sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we propose the use of MLPA as a fast, accurate and inexpensive test to detect large deletions in the UBE3A gene in a small but significant percentage of AS patients </plain></SENT>
