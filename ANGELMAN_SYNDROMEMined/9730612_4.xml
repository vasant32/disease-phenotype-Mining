<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distal breakpoints appear to cluster between the P gene (OCA2) and D15S24, whereas two deletion breakpoint clusters have been identified on the proximal side (one centromeric to D15S541 and one between D15S541 and D15S9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the identification of a gene family in 15q11--&gt;q13 (MN7, D15F37), we have previously proposed that the presence of multiple copies of this sequence may be related to the instability of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using fluorescence in situ hybridization and YAC mapping, we have found that at least one D15F37 locus is centromeric to D15S9 and at least two are between OCA2 and D15S24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As determined by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis, each of the individual loci is expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The close proximity of the D15F37 loci and the deletion breakpoints suggests that the common deletions arise by unequal crossover events at or near these loci </plain></SENT>
