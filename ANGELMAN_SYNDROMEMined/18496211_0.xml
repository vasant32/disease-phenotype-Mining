<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Chromosome 15q11-q13 has been proposed to harbor a gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> susceptibility because deletions of the region lead to Prader-Willi syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, whose phenotypes overlap with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These deletions generally occur with the use of three commonly recognized breakpoints (BP1, BP2, and BP3); therefore, it may be possible that genes located in the breakpoints are impaired and contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No study, however, has investigated the genetic association between the breakpoints and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, to our knowledge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the association between the common breakpoints of chromosome 15q11-q13 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> in a Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 166 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> and 415 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNPs are located in two additional distal breakpoints (BP4 and BP5), involved in duplications and triplications of the region, as well as in BP1 and BP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the controls and patients in allelic frequencies or genotypic distributions of the 12 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the analyses of the suggested five haplotypes, no significant difference between the controls and patients was observed in the distributions of any estimated haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When confining the patients to only males, a difference was observed in a two-marker haplotype in BP3 between the controls and patients (global permutation P value=0.006), although the statistical level became insignificant after correction for multiple testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides no positive evidence of the association between the common breakpoints of chromosome 15q11-q13 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
