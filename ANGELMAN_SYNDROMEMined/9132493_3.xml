<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using various molecular cytogenetic techniques, including comparative genomic hybridisation, we showed that the extra chromatin resulted from in situ amplification of DNA sequences located between the loci D15Z1 and D15S18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the clinical features of our patient and the late replication of the large amplified region, we searched for functional modifications in the adjacent Prader-Willi syndrome region </plain></SENT>
