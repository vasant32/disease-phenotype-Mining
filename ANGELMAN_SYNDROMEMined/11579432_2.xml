<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A number of observations point to chromosome 15 as a good candidate to harbor genes involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by at least two lines of evidence: one is the finding that haploinsufficiency of the 15q11-q13 region, of maternal origin, is responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, one of the cardinal manifestations of which is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>; the second is the observation that extra copies of this same genomic region, in the form of inv-dup(15) or intrachromosomal duplications, again of maternal origin, are usually associated with a severe neurological phenotype characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and untreatable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, both reduced and increased dosage of genes from the 15q11-q13 region, possibly subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp>, appear to be causally involved in severe forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that submicroscopic rearrangements of this genomic region might be responsible for nonsyndromic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in both familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To this purpose, we genotyped 118 epileptic patients and their parents with closely spaced microsatellite markers mapped within the 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report on the results of these studies and review the relevant literature </plain></SENT>
