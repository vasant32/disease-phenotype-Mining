<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>24-hour motor activity was monitored in 13 AS children (age 2-10 yr) in their home environments for 7 days prior to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment and for 5 days during which a 0.3 mg dose of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> was administered daily 0.5-1 hour before the patient's habitual bedtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were with-drawn at hourly intervals over two 21-hour periods in order to measure individual endogenous serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels and the levels induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actigraphic recording of motor activity, confirmed by parents' reports, showed a significant improvement in the patients' nocturnal sleep pattern as a result of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the group data revealed a significant decrease in motor activity during the total sleep period following <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> treatment, and an increase in the duration of the total sleep period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endogenous peak nocturnal <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> values ranged from 19 to 177 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> elevated peak serum hormone levels to 128-2800 pg/ml in children of different ages and body mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a moderate increase in circulating <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> levels significantly reduces motor activity during the sleep period in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> children, and promotes sleep </plain></SENT>
