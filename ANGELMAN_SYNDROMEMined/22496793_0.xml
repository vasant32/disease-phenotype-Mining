<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are neurobehavioral disorders caused by deficiency of imprinted gene expression from paternal and maternal chromosome 15q11-q13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes at the PWS/AS domain are regulated through a bipartite imprinting center, the PWS-IC and AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PWS-IC activates paternal-specific gene expression and is responsible for the paternal imprint, whereas the AS-IC functions in the maternal imprint by allele-specific repression of the PWS-IC to prevent the <z:mp ids='MP_0003123'>paternal imprinting</z:mp> program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although mouse chromosome 7C has a conserved PWS/AS imprinted domain, the mouse equivalent of the human AS-IC element has not yet been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here, we suggest another dimension that the PWS-IC also functions in <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> by negatively regulating the paternally expressed imprinted genes in mice, in contrast to its known function as a positive regulator for paternal-specific gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a mouse model carrying a 4.8-kb deletion at the PWS-IC, we demonstrated that maternal transmission of the PWS-IC deletion resulted in a <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> defect with activation of the paternally expressed imprinted genes and decreased expression of the maternally expressed imprinted gene on the maternal chromosome, accompanied by alteration of the maternal epigenotype toward a paternal state spread over the PWS/AS domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of this acquired paternal pattern of gene expression was demonstrated by the ability to complement PWS phenotypes by maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the PWS-IC deletion, which is in stark contrast to paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the PWS-IC deletion that resulted in the PWS phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Importantly, low levels of expression of the paternally expressed imprinted genes are sufficient to rescue <z:mp ids='MP_0002082'>postnatal lethality</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> in two PWS mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings open the opportunity for a novel approach to the treatment of PWS </plain></SENT>
