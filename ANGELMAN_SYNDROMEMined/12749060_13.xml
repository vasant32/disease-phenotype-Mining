<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS results from the loss of expression of a maternal imprinted gene, UBE3A, mapped within 15q11-q13 region, due to different mechanisms: maternal deletion, paternal UPD, imprinting center mutation, and UBE3A mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletion AS patients may exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> of skin, eye, and hair correlating with deletion of P gene localized in the distal part of Prader-Willi (PWS)/AS region </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His parents were of African ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNURF-SNRPN methylation analysis confirmed AS diagnosis and microsatellite studies disclosed deletion with breakpoints in BP2 and BP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 25 exons and flanking introns of the P gene of the patient, his father, and mother were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient is hemizygous for the deleted exon 7 of the P gene derived from his father who is a carrier of the deleted allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our patient manifests OCA2 associated with AS due to the loss of the maternal chromosome 15 with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> P allele, and the paternal deletion in the P gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As various degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> are associated with PWS and AS patients, the study of the P gene in a hemizygous state could contribute to the understanding of its effect on human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> during development and to disclose the presence of modifier <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> gene(s) in the PWS/AS region </plain></SENT>
