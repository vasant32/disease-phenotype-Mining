<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has raised concern about safety in terms of a possible increase in the incidence of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e>, chromosomal aberrations or developmental problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The possible influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genetic imprinting</z:mp> on an ICSI procedure has not yet been investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore studied the DNA-methylation status at a defined region in chromosome 15q11-q13 in 92 children born after an ICSI procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imprinting defects in this region are associated with neurogenetic disorders, e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken directly after birth and stored at -80 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA purification was performed from 3-7 ml EDTA-blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="26709">Sodium bisulphite</z:chebi> treatment was carried out in order to distinguish methylated from unmethylated DNA by transferring the unmethylated nucleic acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> and leaving the methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 92 children (83 from ICSI with ejaculated spermatozoa and nine from ICSI with non-ejaculated spermatozoa), a regular DNA-methylation pattern was found in the PWS/AS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In none of the children were clinical symptoms of PWS or AS present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of this study do not indicate a higher risk of DNA-methylation defects in children born after ICSI </plain></SENT>
