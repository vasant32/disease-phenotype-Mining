<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To draw attention to the phenomenon that EEG characteristics of both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> (RS) can be found in the same patient, as evidenced by the description of one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are specific EEG patterns in AS patients, in which the most frequently occurring EEG characteristics are rhythmic triphasic 2- to 3-Hz, high-voltage (200-500 microV) activity, mixed with spikes or sharp waves, with a maximum over the frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EEG changes in RS patients are less specific and can show multifocal, mostly central or centrotemporal epileptiform discharges in combination with slow background activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 6-year-old girl with RS and a proven MECP2 mutation was described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: She had an EEG pattern at age 2 years comparable with the clinical diagnosis of RS, and an EEG at age 6 years comparable with an AS EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We wish to draw attention to this phenomenon, although there is as yet no evident explanation for it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We advise MECP2 examination in AS patients of unknown genetic etiology whose EEG examinations are/were pathognomonic for AS to exclude RS </plain></SENT>
