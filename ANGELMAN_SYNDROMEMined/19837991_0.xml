<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS patients with an imprinting defect have only paternal genes expression pattern despite the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bi-parental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 2-3% of AS cases, the altered gene expression is a consequence of an imprinting defect (ID) such as microdeletions in imprinting centre (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistically, one third of patients with an imprinting defect and no IC deletion have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were: identification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> for an imprinting defect in the patients with clinical manifestation of AS and development of a procedure for the identification of IC microdeletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty eight AS patients with an aberrant methylation pattern confirmed in methylation screening procedure (MS-PCR) were qualified for mosaicism analysis with quantitative real-time PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quantitative analysis of methylated alleles did not confirm the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> in any of the examined patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The methods for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> and microdeletion in IC analyses based on quantitative real-time PCR technique can be used in the molecular diagnostic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
