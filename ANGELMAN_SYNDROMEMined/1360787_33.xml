<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deletions arise differentially during maternal or paternal gametogenesis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients with either syndrome have no apparent deletion, and because many such patients with Prader-Willi syndrome display <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother only (<z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>; UPD), we suggested that paternal UPD might be found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular evidence on the 1 patient with paternal UPD for chromosome 15 who was found in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This represents, to our knowledge, the first patient with paternal UPD to be studied with DNA probes from the chromosome 15q11-q13 critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to our findings for patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, in which maternal UPD was common, our data demonstrate that paternal UPD is infrequent in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
