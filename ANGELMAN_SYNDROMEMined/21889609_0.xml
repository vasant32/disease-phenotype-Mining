<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we applied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi>-based real-time PCR and melting curve analysis assay for rapid genotyping of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN) gene methylation status and for detecting aberrations in copy number in a single tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single pair of primers was designed to create a 357 bp fragment containing the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> phosphodiester <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> islands in the SNRPN promoter and to amplify both unmethylated and methylated sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were identified based on the TC value for copy number changes and the characteristic melting temperature of methylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> phosphodiester <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of SNRPN was performed on blood samples of 20 individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, 3 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and 20 unaffected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The promoter methylation status and the copy number changes were successfully determined and compared with standard methylation-specific PCR, and were validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This single-tube, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi>, real-time PCR with melting curve assay is rapid, reliable, sensitive, and easy to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suitable for high-throughput analysis as an alternative technique for quantitative and qualitative analysis of target genes </plain></SENT>
