<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, we showed that truncation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5/STK9) gene caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and severe neurological symptoms in two female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that de novo missense mutations in CDKL5 are associated with a severe phenotype of early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> and clinical features that overlap those of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutations are located within the protein kinase domain and affect highly conserved amino acids; this strongly suggests that impaired CDKL5 catalytic activity plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the overlapping phenotypic spectrum of CDKL5 and MECP2 mutations, it is tempting to speculate that these two genes play a role in a common pathogenic process </plain></SENT>
