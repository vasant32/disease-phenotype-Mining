<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Researchers access these tissues through a peer-reviewed, project-based approval process, and obtain related clinical information from a secure, online informatics portal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, few of these samples have DNA banked from other sources (such as a blood sample from the same individual), hindering genotype-phenotype correlation and interpretation of gene expression data derived from the banked brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe an initiative to extract DNA from Brodmann Area 19, and genotype these samples using both the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 and the Illumina Human1M-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip genome-wide microarray technologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We additionally verify reported gender, and infer ethnic background from the single nucleotide polymorphism data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also used a rigorous, multiple algorithm approach to identify genomic copy number variation (CNV) from these array data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following an initial proof of principle study using two samples, 52 experimental samples, consisting of 27 subjects with confirmed or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and related disorders, 5 subjects with cytogenetically visible duplications of 15q, 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and 18 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were processed, yielding high-quality genotype data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genotype and CNV data are provided via the ATP informatics portal as a resource for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> research community </plain></SENT>
