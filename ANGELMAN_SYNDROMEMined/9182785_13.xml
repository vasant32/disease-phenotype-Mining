<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to test these patients for deletion of chromosome 15(q11-13) and to describe the adult phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The selection criteria included severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, ataxic or hypermotoric limb movements, lack of speech, a "happy" demeanour, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and facial appearance consistent with the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were examined, medical records perused, and patients' doctors contacted as required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic tests performed included routine cytogenetics, DNA methylation analysis (with probe PW71B), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (with probes D15S10, GABRbeta3, or SNRPN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A deletion in the AS region was detected in 11 patients (9 males and 2 females) of 22 tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at last review (March 1996) was 31.5 years (range 24 to 36 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical assessment documented findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>large mouth</z:hpo> and jaw with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000490'>deep set eyes</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> in nine patients (two having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>large head</z:hpo> size for height) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient was hypopigmented; 1/11 patients was fair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outbursts of laughter occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but infrequently in 7/11 (64%) and a constant happy demeanour was present in 5/11 (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, with improvement in 5/11 (46%), no change in 4 (36%), and deterioration in 2 (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EEG was abnormal in 10/10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ocular abnormalities were reported in 3/8 patients (37.5%) and 4/11 (36%) had developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two had never walked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine who walked were ataxic with an awkward, clumsy, heavy, and/or lilting gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No patient had a single word of speech but one patient could use sign language for two needs (food and drink) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our data support the concept that AS resulting from deletion is a severe neurological syndrome in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis in adults may not be straightforward as some manifestations change with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>Kyphosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000563'>keratoconus</z:hpo> are two problems of older patients </plain></SENT>
