<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both mechanisms result in a loss of the active paternal contribution to the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The affective <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> associated with PWS has been found to be mainly confined to the propositi with UPD(15)mat rather than to those with a deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> may be related to the presence of two copies rather than a single copy of a gene or genes located in the distal half of the region which is paternally imprinted, but maternally active, and whose loss results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A large population-based study of PWS allowed the identification of 12 people with a 15q11-q13 deletion who had suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0000725'>psychotic episodes</z:hpo> and four adults with UPD(15)mat who so far had not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When these people were investigated using microsatellite markers, the 12 with a deletion were found to have two maternally derived copies of a narrow region between D15S975 and D15S661 making them effectively disomic for these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> had two active copies of any imprinted genes in the region while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> people (including controls) had only one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quantitative RT-PCR studies suggest that a lack of expression of FLJ33332, either as a result of or resulting in gene dysregulation, may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> in PWS </plain></SENT>
