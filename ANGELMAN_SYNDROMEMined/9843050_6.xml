<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a relatively large survey of Prader-Willi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, Angelman</z:e> syndrome, and control subjects with the newly described methylation polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to determine its usefulness for molecular diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) individuals (26 men and 35 women), 9 Angelman syndrome (AS) patients (5 men and 4 women), and 58 other individuals were studied with methylation PCR following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, multiple tissues, including fetal tissue, were studied from several individuals to determine the effects of various tissues on methylation PCR results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expected methylation PCR result was observed in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This PCR-based assay evaluates the methylation status of the CpG island of the SNRPN gene and allows for rapid molecular diagnosis of PWS or AS with less labor than Southern hybridization for methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PCR results were identical to those achieved by Southern hybridization in those individuals studied </plain></SENT>
