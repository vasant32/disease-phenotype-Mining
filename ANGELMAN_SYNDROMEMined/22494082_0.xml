<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the functions of challenging behaviour in four children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and to study the effects of functional communication training (FCT) with precursor-based prompting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study builds on and extends the study of Allen et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Experimental functional analysis assessed behavioural functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FCT was implemented within an ABAB design and effect sizes were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Burst analyses depict tendencies in (precursor) behaviours surrounding target behaviours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results show challenging behaviour to be aimed at receiving attention, tangibles or escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Burst analysis designated physical and eye contact and reaching for tangibles as precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effects of FCT ranged from small to large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Behavioural functions for challenging behaviour were found and FCT was effective in reducing its frequency, when precursors were used as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of prompting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Functional equivalence between challenging and communicative behaviour was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Implementing treatment for challenging behaviour based on precursors is advised </plain></SENT>
