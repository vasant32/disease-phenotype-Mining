<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, how E6AP activity is regulated at the post-translational level under non-pathologic conditions is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report that the giant protein HERC2, which is like E6AP a member of the HECT family of ubiquitin-protein ligases, binds to E6AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interaction is mediated by the RCC1-like domain 2 of HERC2 and a region spanning amino acid residues 150-200 of E6AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide evidence that HERC2 stimulates the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of E6AP in vitro and within cells and that this stimulatory effect does not depend on the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of HERC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the data obtained indicate that HERC2 acts as a regulator of E6AP </plain></SENT>
