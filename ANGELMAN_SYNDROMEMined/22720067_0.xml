<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The 15q11-q13 region is characterized by high instability, caused by the presence of several paralogous segmental duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most mechanisms dealing with cryptic deletions and amplifications have been at least partly characterized, little is known about the rare translocations involving this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized at the molecular level five unbalanced translocations, including a jumping one, having most of 15q transposed to the end of another chromosome, whereas the der(15)(pter-&gt;q11-q13) was missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imbalances were associated either with Prader-Willi or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH demonstrated the absence of any copy number changes in the recipient chromosome in three cases, while one carried a cryptic terminal deletion and another a large terminal deletion, already diagnosed by classical cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We cloned the breakpoint junctions in two cases, whereas cloning was impaired by complex regional genomic architecture and mosaicism in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly indicate that some of our translocations originated through a prezygotic/postzygotic two-hit mechanism starting with the formation of an acentric 15qter-&gt;q1::q1-&gt;qter representing the reciprocal product of the inv dup(15) supernumerary marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An embryo with such an acentric chromosome plus a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 15 inherited from the other parent could survive only if partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 15 rescue would occur through elimination of part of the acentric chromosome, stabilization of the remaining portion with telomere capture, and formation of a derivative chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these events likely do not happen concurrently in a single cell but are rather the result of successive stabilization attempts occurring in different cells of which only the fittest will finally survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, jumping translocations might represent successful rescue attempts in different cells rather than transfer of the same 15q portion to different chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also hypothesize that neocentromerization of the original acentric chromosome during early embryogenesis may be required to avoid its loss before cell survival is finally assured </plain></SENT>
