<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They function as the primary excitatory cells of the mammalian prefrontal cortex and the corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of polarized dendrite <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in pyramidal neurons remain poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> protein ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (Ube3a) plays an important role in specifying the polarization of pyramidal neuron dendritic arbors in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>shRNA-mediated downregulation of Ube3a selectively inhibited apical dendrite outgrowth and resulted in impaired dendrite polarity, which could be rescued by coexpressing mouse Ube3a isoform 2, but not isoform 1 or 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ube3a knockdown also disrupted the polarized distribution of the Golgi apparatus, a well established cellular mechanism for asymmetric dendritic growth in pyramidal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, downregulation of Ube3a completely blocked Reelin-induced rapid deployment of Golgi into dendrite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistently, we also observed selective inhibition of apical dendrite outgrowth in pyramidal neurons in a mouse model of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results show that Ube3a is required for the specification of the apical dendrites and dendrite polarization in pyramidal neurons, and suggest a novel pathological mechanism for AS </plain></SENT>
