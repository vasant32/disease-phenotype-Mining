<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied the inverted duplicated chromosomes 15 (inv dup(15)) from 11 individuals--7 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 3 with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp>, and 1 with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a combination of FISH and quantitative DNA analyses, three different molecular sizes of inv dup(15) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The smallest inv dup(15) was positive only for the centromeric locus D15Z1 (type 1); the next size was positive for D15Z1 and D15S18 (type 2); and the largest inv dup(15) was positive for two additional copies of loci extending from D15Z1 and D15S18 through D15S12 (type 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 1 or type 2 was observed in the three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and the PWS patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 3 was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> but without PWS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PWS patient, in addition to being mosaic for a small inv dup(15), demonstrated at D15S63 a methylation pattern consistent with maternal uniparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results from this study show (a) two additional copies of proximal 15q loci, D15S9 through D15S12, in mentally retarded patients with an inv dup(15) but without AS or PWS and (b) no additional copies of these loci in patients with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> or with PWS </plain></SENT>
