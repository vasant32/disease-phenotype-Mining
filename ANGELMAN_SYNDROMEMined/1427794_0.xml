<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are associated with the physical absence of the paternal Prader-Willi chromosome region (PWCR) by deletion 15q11-13, by segmental maternal heterodisomy or by chromosome rearrangements resulting in homozygosity for maternal PWCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In isolated/familial cases, it is proposed that the expression of PWS depends on the functional absence caused by mutated gene(s) within the paternal PWCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same mutation on a maternally derived chromosome 15 is not able to express PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An epigenetic mechanism associated with the paternal meiosis is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, inverse mechanisms are postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is convincing evidence for specific PWS and AS genes or alleles within PWCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is compatible with the observations of interstitial chromosome deletions of the critical region in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals or in probands with phenotypes other than PWS or AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The new ideas of the model stated here are: (1) the proposed epigenetic mechanism in PWCR is obviously common in humans, but is usually of no phenotypic relevance; (2) interactions with specific chromosomal or gene mutations are required for the clinical expression of PWS or AS; (3) each factor alone is not able to produce an abnormal phenotype </plain></SENT>
