<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have exploited this characteristic of an imprinted region by using FISH at D15S9 and SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleo protein N) on interphase nuclei to distinguish between Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome patient samples with <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 15q11-q13 (n = 11) from those with biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The familial recurrence risks are low when the child has de novo <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and may be as high as 50% when the child has biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of interphase cells with asynchronous replication was significantly lower in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> than in patients with biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the sample population of patients with biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, those with altered methylation and presumably imprinting center mutations could not be distinguished from those with no currently detectable mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This test is cost effective because it is performed on interphase cells from the same hybridized cytological preparation in which a deletion is excluded, and additional specimens are not required to determine the parental origin of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
