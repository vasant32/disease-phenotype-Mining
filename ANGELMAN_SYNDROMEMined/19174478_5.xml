<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuroanatomically, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> is characterized by a reduction in dendritic arborization and perikaryal size in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MECP2 binds methylated promoters and facilitates assembly of a multiprotein repressor complex that includes Sin3A and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylases HDAC1/HDAC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MeCP2 has recently been found to be downregulated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524528" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic spectrum disorders</z:e> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>, which share some phenotypic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have conducted expression analysis of cytoskeleton-related genes in brain tissue of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> and AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Striking examples of genes with reduced expression were TUBA1B and TUBA3 that encode the ubiquitous alpha-tubulin and the neuronal specific alpha-tubulin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the downregulation of expression of these genes, we have observed a reduction in the level of the corresponding protein product-tyrosinated alpha-tubulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low levels of alpha-tubulin and deteriorated cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were also observed in MeCP2(-/y) MEF cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effects of MeCP2 deficiency in these cells were completely reversed by introducing and expressing the human MeCP2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results imply that MeCP2 is involved in the regulation of neuronal alpha-tubulin and add molecular evidence that reversal of the effects of MeCP2 deficiency is achievable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This raises hopes for a cure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> and related MeCP2 deficiency disorders of the autistic spectrum </plain></SENT>
