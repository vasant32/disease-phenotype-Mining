<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of research has in recent years shed light on genetic and biochemical aetiologies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and, often in a different literature, on syndromes of ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this annotation are to review developments in understanding of the pathophysiology of several ID syndromes in which <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is a frequent co-occurrence and to relate these observations to recent advances in understanding of how these pathophysiological disturbances may lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The ID syndromes selected for review were fragile X (FXS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes (AS)</z:e> and tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> complex (TSC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> is a significant aspect of these syndromes and relevant research into the genetic and biochemical pathophysiology of these four ID syndromes may be informative in establishing the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Employing a structured approach the authors initially searched the PubMed database for large case series describing the characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> as manifested in these ID syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The criteria for inclusion of the case series in the review were a sample size of greater than 50 and the description of several of the characteristic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, namely prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> semiology, severity and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following this, studies of the genetic and biochemical pathophysiology of these four ID syndromes were reviewed and the potential relevance of this research in understanding the association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Findings were considered in a focused manner in terms of effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems and on glial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diverse genetic pathologies underlying several ID syndromes can lead to alterations in the functioning of the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved include transcriptional regulation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>, translational regulation in FXS and TSC, and UBE3A-mediated proteolysis in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression or functioning of receptor subunits, uptake sites and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism are often affected by these changes, and may lead to modifications in network excitability and neuronal plasticity that may contribute to epileptogenesis and ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dysfunction in astrocytes may also contribute to epileptogenesis and ID in FXS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> and TSC with potential mechanisms including failure of astrocytic support functions, glial <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and homeostatic disturbances that affect the excitability and architecture of neuronal networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The annotation highlights research describing disturbances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, neuronal ion channel and glial functions that provide possible explanations for the co-occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> within several ID syndromes, in some cases suggesting possible avenues for research into novel therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic overlaps between syndromes may also relate to roles for the implicated genes in different disturbances in linked biochemical pathways </plain></SENT>
