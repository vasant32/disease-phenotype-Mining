<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic silencing of the paternal UBE3A allele in brain appears to be mediated by a non-coding UBE3A antisense (UBE3A-ATS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In human, UBE3A-ATS extends approximately 450 kb to UBE3A from the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N (SNURF/SNRPN) promoter region that contains a cis-acting imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concept of a single large antisense transcript is difficult to reconcile with the observation that SNURF/SNRPN shows a ubiquitous pattern of expression while the more distal part of UBE3A-ATS, which overlaps UBE3A, is brain specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this problem, we examined murine transcripts initiating from several alternative exons dispersed within a 500 kb region upstream of Snurf/Snrpn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar to Ube3a-ATS, these upstream (U) exon-containing transcripts are expressed at neuronal stages of differentiation in a cell culture model of neurogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the novel hypothesis that brain-specific transcription of Ube3a-ATS is regulated by the U exons rather than Snurf/Snrpn exon 1 as previously suggested from human studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In support of this hypothesis, we describe U-Ube3a-ATS transcripts where U exons are spliced to Ube3a-ATS with the exclusion of Snurf-Snrpn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also show that the murine U exons have arisen by genomic duplication of segments that include elements of the IC, suggesting that the brain specific silencing of Ube3a is due to multiple alternatively spliced IC-Ube3a-ATS transcripts </plain></SENT>
