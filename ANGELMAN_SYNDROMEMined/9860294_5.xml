<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis is one method of distinguishing between the maternally and paternally inherited chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present clinical and molecular data on a large series of 258 referred patients, evaluated with methylation analysis: 115 with suspected PWS and 143 with suspected AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the clinical phenotype was graded into three groups: classical (group 1); not classical but possible (group 2); not classical and unlikely (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For PWS, a fourth group consisted of hypotonic babies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation analysis confirmed the diagnosis of PWS in 30 patients (26%) and AS in 28 patients (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 21 PWS patients the mechanism was established: 15 had deletions, 4 had <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) and 2 a presumed imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those with an abnormal methylation pattern had the classical phenotype and none of those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern had classical PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For 23 AS patients in whom a mechanism was established, 17 had a deletion, 3 had UPD and 3 had a presumed imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was greater clinical overlap in AS, with 26 classical AS patients having a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern while an abnormal methylation pattern was seen in one patient from group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were a further 40 patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern in whom AS was still a possible diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is that methylation analysis provides an excellent screening test for both syndromes, providing approximately 99% diagnosis for PWS and for AS, a 75% diagnostic rate, supplemented for the remaining 25% with an essential basic starting point to further investigations </plain></SENT>
