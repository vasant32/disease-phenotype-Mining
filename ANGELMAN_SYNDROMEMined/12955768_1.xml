<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a new ocular finding, retinochoroidal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (RCA), associated with optic disk paleness in two adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> due to maternal 15q11-13 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ocular involvement described in children with AS consists iris and choroids <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> due to loss of function of one copy of P gene involved in maternal deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The loss of one copy of the same gene of paternal origin leads to a similar ocular phenotype as in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However to our knowledge, RCA has never been described before in PWS, suggesting that other maternally expressed genes, particularly UBE3A, could be responsible for the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> changes observed in the adult AS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although, further investigations would be necessary to better understand the role of the UBE3A in the retina, the findings reported here should prompt a systematic ophthalmologic evaluation adult patients with AS in order to establish the real incidence of RCA and prevent further disability in these patients </plain></SENT>
