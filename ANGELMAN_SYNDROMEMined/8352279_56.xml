<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), ascertained from Prader-Willi syndrome patients (N = 27) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients (N = 5), are used to investigate the pattern of recombination associated with nondisjunction of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the meiotic stage of nondisjunction is inferred by using markers mapping near the centromere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two basic approaches to the analysis of recombination are utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard methods of centromere mapping are employed to determine the level of recombination in specific pairwise intervals along the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method shows a significant reduction in recombination for two of five intervals examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the observed frequency of each recombinant class (i.e., zero, one, two, three, or more observable crossovers) is compared with expected values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is useful for testing whether the reduction in recombination can be attributed solely to a proportion of cases with no recombination at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (because of asynapsis), with the remaining groups showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> recombination (or even excess recombination), or whether recombination is uniformly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of maternal UPD(15) data shows a slight reduction in the multiple-recombinant classes, with a corresponding increase in both the zero- and one-recombinant classes over expected values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority, more than 82%, of the extra chromosomes in maternal UPD(15) cases are due to meiotic I nondisjunction events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, most paternal UPD(15) cases so far examined appear to have a postzygotic origin of the extra paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
