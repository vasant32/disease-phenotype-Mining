<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sleep breathing patterns and to detect the eventual presence of periodic leg movements (PLMs) in patients affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten children with AS were recruited to participate in the study; the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by the genetic analysis (maternal 15q deletion, uniparental paternal disomy, or mutation of the UBE3A gene) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but two had presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two age-matched groups of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) associated (MRE+) or not (MRE-) to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were used as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent one polysomnographic recording, after one adaptation night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sleep stages were scored according to standard criteria slightly modified in order to take into account the specific EEG patterns of AS, also the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index (AHI) was quantified; PLMs were identified and the PLM index (PLMI) was computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was carried out by means of the one-way ANOVA, followed by the Fisher <z:chebi fb="162" ids="6605">LSD</z:chebi> post-hoc test, when appropriate, and by means of the linear correlation coefficient between AHI and PLMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sleep macrostructure showed only few significant differences between children with AS and the other two groups of subjects: AS patients showed higher percentage of wakefulness after sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> latency; moreover, the percentage of REM sleep was reduced in AS and in MRE+ subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A tendency for AS subjects to present a higher PLMI than the other two groups was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AHI &gt;5 was found in 30% of AS subjects, in 30.8% of MRE+, and only in 20% of MRE- patients (chi(2) = 2.359, NS); 70% of AS patients, 38.5% of MRE+, and 46.7% of MRE- subjects had PLMI &gt;5 (chi(2) = 3.088, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm our previous questionnaire-based findings of a high prevalence of sleep breathing disorder and important PLMs in AS and allow us to hypothesize that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, might exacerbate these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Sleep breathing disorder and PLMs might contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and to the worsening of life quality of subjects with AS and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> (mostly those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our findings suggest the need to explore these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> in children affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and to set up a correct treatment </plain></SENT>
