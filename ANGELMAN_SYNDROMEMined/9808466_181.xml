<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ube3a is imprinted with silencing of the paternal allele in hippocampus and cerebellum in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the phenotype of mice with maternal deficiency (m-/p+) for Ube3a resembles human AS with motor dysfunction, inducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and a context-dependent learning deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely impaired in m-/p+ mice despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> baseline synaptic transmission and neuroanatomy, indicating that ubiquitination may play a role in mammalian LTP and that LTP may be abnormal in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytoplasmic abundance of p53 was increased in postmitotic neurons in m-/p+ mice and in AS, providing a potential biochemical basis for the phenotype through failure to ubiquitinate and degrade various effectors </plain></SENT>
