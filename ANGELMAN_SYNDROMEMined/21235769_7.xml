<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, a generally happy disposition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and characteristic behaviors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000748'>inappropriate laughter</z:hpo>, social-seeking behavior and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of AS cases are due to loss of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Maternal Ube3a deficiency (Ube3a m-/p+), as well as complete loss of Ube3a expression (Ube3a m-/p-), have been reproduced in the mouse model used here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we asked if two characteristic AS phenotypes - social-seeking behavior and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> - are reproduced in the Ube3a deficient mouse model of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We quantified social-seeking behavior as time spent in close proximity to a stranger mouse and activity as total time spent moving during exploration, movement speed and total length of the exploratory path </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mice of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three genotypes (Ube3a m+/p+, Ube3a m-/p+, Ube3a m-/p-) were tested and found to spend the same amount of time in close proximity to the stranger, indicating that Ube3a deficiency in mice does not result in increased social seeking behavior or social dis-inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, Ube3a deficient mice were <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactive</z:mp> compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates as shown by significantly lower levels of activity, slower movement velocities, shorter exploratory paths and a reduced exploratory range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and social-seeking behavior are characteristic phenotypes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> in humans, the Ube3a deficient mouse model does not reproduce these phenotypes in comparison to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These phenotypic differences may be explained by differences in the size of the genetic defect as ~70% of AS patients have a deletion that includes several other genes surrounding the UBE3A locus </plain></SENT>
