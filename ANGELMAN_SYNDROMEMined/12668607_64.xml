<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several AS model mice, imprinted Ube3a expression is detected predominantly in the hippocampus, cerebellar Purkinje cells and the olfactory bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, imprinting of mouse Ube3a is thought to be region-specific with different levels of silencing of the paternal Ube3a allele in different brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine cell types of imprinted Ube3a expression, we analyzed its imprinting status in embryonic brain cells by using primary cortical cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and immunofluorescence were performed to determine the allelic expression of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Ube3a gene encodes two <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts in the brain, sense and antisense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sense transcript was expressed maternally in neurons but biallelically in glial cells in the embryonic brain, whereas the antisense transcript was expressed only in neurons and only from the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data present evidence of brain cell type-specific imprinting, i.e. neuron-specific imprinting of Ube3a in primary brain cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reciprocal imprinting of sense and antisense transcripts present only in neurons suggests that the neuron-specific imprinting mechanism is related to the lineage determination of neural stem cells </plain></SENT>
