<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a small group of patients, the disease is due to aberrant imprinting and gene silencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the molecular analysis of 51 patients with PWS and 85 patients with AS who have such a defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with PWS (14%) and eight patients with AS (9%) were found to have an imprinting center (IC) deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of 32 patients with PWS and no IC deletion and 66 patients with AS and no IC deletion did not reveal any point mutation in the critical IC elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of a faint methylated band in 27% of patients with AS and no IC deletion suggests that these patients are mosaic for an imprinting defect that occurred after fertilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with AS, the imprinting defect occurred on the chromosome that was inherited from either the maternal grandfather or grandmother; however, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative patients with PWS and no IC deletion, the imprinting defect occurred on the chromosome inherited from the paternal grandmother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this imprinting defect results from a failure to erase the maternal imprint during spermatogenesis </plain></SENT>
