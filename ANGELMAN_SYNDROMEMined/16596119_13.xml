<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the majority of patients with a chromosome 15 imprinting defect (ID) causing Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, the defect is a primary epimutation that occurred spontaneously in the absence of a DNA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated whether common DNA sequence variants in the bipartite imprinting centre (IC) are associated with an increased susceptibility to imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have determined the haplotype structure of the IC and found that the two IC elements called 'PWS-SRO' and 'AS-SRO' lie on separate haplotype blocks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify susceptible IC sequence variants, we have used the transmission disequilibrium test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While we did not observe preferential transmission of a paternal allele or haplotype in 41 PWS-ID trios, we found a trend for preferential maternal transmission of one AS-SRO haplotype (H-AS3) in 48 AS-ID trios (P=0.058) and could identify two sequence variants in H-AS3 that are responsible for this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also obtained tentative evidence that homozygosity for the 677C&gt;T variant of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene on chromosome 1 might increase the risk of a <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> defect: the frequency of the TT genotype was significantly higher in the mothers of the AS patients with an imprinting defect than in the patients' fathers or the general population (P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that women with the IC haplotype H-AS3 or homozygosity for the MTHFR 677C&gt;T variant may have an increased risk of conceiving a child with an imprinting defect, although the absolute risk is low </plain></SENT>
