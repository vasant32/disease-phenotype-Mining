<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the gene for E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) was mapped to the critical region for AS, evidence of expression from both parental alleles initially suggested that it was an unlikely candidate gene for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because attempts to identify any novel maternally expressed transcripts were unsuccessful and because the UBE3A gene remained within a narrowed AS critical region, we searched for mutations in UBE3A in 11 AS patients without known molecular defects (large deletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, or imprinting mutation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This analysis tested the possibility that deficiency of an undefined, maternally expressed transcript or isoform of the UBE3A gene could cause AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four mutations were identified including a de novo frameshift mutation and a de novo nonsense mutation in exon 3 and two missense mutations of less certain significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The de novo truncating mutations indicate that UBE3A is the AS gene and suggest the possibility of a maternally expressed gene product in addition to the biallelically expressed transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intragenic mutation of UBE3A in AS is the first example of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It may represent an example of a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> associated with a locus producing functionally distinct imprinted and biallelically expressed gene products </plain></SENT>
