<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Extra copies of the Prader-Willi-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region (PWASCR) have been shown to have detrimental phenotypic effects depending on the parent of origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hexasomy for the PWASCR is rare; only 6 cases have been described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on a 15-year-old girl referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with a mosaic tricentric small marker chromosome (SMC) 15 identified by routine G-banding chromosome studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-banding and FISH confirmed the presence of three chromosome 15 centromeres as well as four copies of the PWASCR on the SMC in approximately 60% of interphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite genotyping documented maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the SMC, and methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MS-MLPA) showed that the extra copies of the PWASCR contained on the marker chromosome bear a methylation pattern similar to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maternal chromosome, implying maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the patient's phenotype as paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of such a marker chromosome is thought to be benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, this patient's phenotype is the mildest described to date and may be a result of mosaicism for the SMC </plain></SENT>
