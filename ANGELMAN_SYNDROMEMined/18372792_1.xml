<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significant influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> during development sets the stage for structural and physiological variations affecting psychological function and behaviour, as well as other physiological systems mediating health and well-being </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, our understanding of the role of imprinted genes in behaviour lags far behind our understanding of their roles in perinatal growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> remains limited among behavioral scientists and clinicians and research regarding the influence of imprinted genes on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cognitive processes and the most common forms of neuropathology has been limited to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this chapter, we will explore how knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> can be used to inform our study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cognitive and behavioral processes as well as their disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioural analyses of rare imprinted disorders, such as Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, provide insight regarding the phenotypic impact of imprinted genes in the brain, and can be used to guide the study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> behaviour as well as more common but etiologically complex disorders such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hypotheses regarding the evolutionary development of imprinted genes can be used to derive predictions about their role in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> behavioural variation, such as that observed in food-related and social interactions </plain></SENT>
