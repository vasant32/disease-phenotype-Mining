<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 2 distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> caused primarily by deficiency of specific parental contributions at an imprinted domain within the chromosomal region 15q11.2-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lack of paternal contribution results in PWS either by paternal deletion (approximately 70%) or maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) (approximately 25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cases of AS result from the lack of a maternal contribution from this same region, by maternal deletion (70%) or paternal UPD (approximately 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of allelic methylation differences at the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN) locus differentiates the maternally and paternally inherited chromosome 15 and can be used as a diagnostic test for AS and PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting-curve analysis (MS-HRM) using the DNA binding dye EvaGreen was used to analyze methylation differences at the SNRPN locus in anonymized DNA samples from individuals with PWS (n = 39) or AS (n = 31) and from healthy control individuals (n = 95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results from the MS-HRM assay were compared to those obtained by use of a methylation-specific PCR (MSP) protocol that is used commonly in diagnostic practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With the MS-HRM assay 97.6% of samples were unambiguously assigned to the 3 diagnostic categories (AS, PWS, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) by use of automated calling with an 80% confidence percentage threshold, and the failure rate was 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One PWS sample showed a discordant result for the MS-HRM assay compared to MSP data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MS-HRM is a simple, rapid, and robust method for screening methylation differences at the SNRPN locus and could be used as a diagnostic screen for PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
