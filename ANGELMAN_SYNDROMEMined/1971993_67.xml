<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the extent of deletion in AS we analyzed the DNA of 19 AS patients, including two sib pairs, with the following chromosome 15q11q13--specific DNA markers: D15S9-D15S13, D15S17, D15S18, and D15S24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three molecular classes were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Class I showed a deletion of D15S9-D15S13 and D15S18; class II showed a deletion of D15S9-D15S13; and in class III, including both sib pairs, no deletion was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These molecular classes appear to be identical to those observed in PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution cytogenetic data were available on 16 of the patients, and complete concordance between the presence of a cytogenetic deletion and a molecular deletion was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No submicroscopic deletions were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA samples from the parents of 10 patients with either a class I or a class II deletion were available for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven of the 10 families, RFLPs were informative as to the parental origin of the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative families, the deleted chromosome 15 was observed to be of maternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding is in contrast to the paternal origin of the deletions in PWS and is currently the only molecular difference observed between the two syndromes </plain></SENT>
