<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The imprinted domain on human chromosome 15 consists of two oppositely imprinted gene clusters, which are under the control of an imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paternally expressed SNURF-SNRPN gene hosts several snoRNA genes and overlaps the UBE3A gene, which is encoded on the opposite strand, expressed - at least in brain cells - from the maternal chromosome only, and affected in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to SNURF-SNRPN, imprinted expression of UBE3A is not regulated by a 5' differentially methylated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report that splice forms of the SNURF-SNRPN transcript overlapping UBE3A in an antisense orientation are present in brain but barely detectable in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, splice forms that do not overlap with UBE3A are of similar abundance in brain and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The tissue distribution of the splice forms parallels that of the snoRNAs encoded in the respective parts of the SNURF-SNRPN transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a quantitative PCR assay, we have found that the ratio of SNURF-SNRPN/UBE3A transcript levels is increased in blood cells of AS patients with an imprinting defect, but not in AS patients with a UBE3A mutation or an unknown defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings are compatible with the assumption that imprinted UBE3A expression is regulated through the SNURF-SNRPN sense- UBE3A antisense transcript </plain></SENT>
