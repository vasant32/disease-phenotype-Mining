<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>Genomic imprinting</z:mp> is an exception to Mendelian genetics in that imprinted genes are expressed monoallelically, dependent on parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mammals, imprinted genes are critical in numerous developmental and physiological processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant imprinted gene expression is implicated in several diseases including Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify novel imprinted genes, transcription profiling was performed on two uniparentally derived cell lines, androgenetic and parthenogenetic primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A maternally expressed transcript termed Imprinted <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> near Meg3/Gtl2 (Irm) was identified and its expression studied by Northern blotting and whole mounts in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The imprinted region that contains Irm has a parent of origin effect in three mammalian species, including the sheep callipyge locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In mice and humans, both maternal and paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomies</z:mp> (UPD) cause embryonic growth and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151491" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">musculoskeletal abnormalities</z:e>, indicating that both alleles likely express essential genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To catalog <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> imprinted genes in this chromosomal region, twenty-five mouse <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in a 1.96Mb span were investigated for allele specific expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ten imprinted genes were elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The imprinting of three paternally expressed protein coding genes (Dlk1, Peg11, and Dio3) was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> (Meg3/Gtl2, Anti-Peg11, Meg8, Irm/"Rian", AK050713, AK053394, and Meg9/Mirg) are characterized by exclusive maternal expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the majority of these noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> genes contain microRNAs and/or snoRNAs within their introns, as do their human orthologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 identified microRNAs that map to this region, six are predicted to regulate negatively Dlk1, suggesting an additional mechanism for interactions between allelic gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since several previous studies relied heavily on in silico analysis and RT-PCR, our findings from Northerns and cDNA cloning clarify the genomic organization of this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results expand the number of maternally expressed noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> whose loss may be responsible for the phenotypes associated with mouse pUPD12 and human pUPD14 syndromes </plain></SENT>
