<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relative importance of SLC9A6 mutations in patients with an AS-like phenotype or XMR has not been fully investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, the involvement of SLC9A6 mutations in 22 males initially suspected to have AS but found on genetic testing not to have AS (AS-like cohort), and 104 male patients with XMR (XMR cohort), was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A novel SLC9A6 mutation (c.441delG, p.S147fs) was identified in one patient in the AS-like cohort, but no mutation was identified in XMR cohort, suggesting mutations in SLC9A6 are not a major cause of the AS-like phenotype or XMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient with the SLC9A6 mutation showed the typical AS phenotype, further demonstrating the similarity between patients with AS and those with SLC9A6 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To clarify the effect of the SLC9A6 mutation, we performed RT-PCR and Western blot analysis on lymphoblastoid cells from the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of the mutated transcript was significantly reduced, but was restored by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> treatment, indicating the presence of nonsense mediated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated absence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> NHE6 protein encoded for by SLC9A6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicate a loss-of-function mutation in SLC9A6 caused the phenotype in our patient </plain></SENT>
