<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001319'>neonatal hypotonia</z:hpo>, childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, dysmorphic features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although PWS is most often caused by a paternal interstitial deletion of a 6-Mb region of chromosome 15q11-q13, the identity of the exact protein coding or noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> whose deficiency produces the PWS phenotype is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are also reports describing a PWS-like phenotype in a subset of patients with full mutations in the FMR1 (fragile X <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> 1) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of the human genome sequence, we have performed extensive sequence analysis and molecular studies for the PWS candidate region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have characterized transcripts for the first time for two UCSC Genome Browser predicted protein-coding genes, GOLGA8E (golgin subfamily a, 8E) and WHDC1L1 (WAS protein homology region containing 1-like 1) and have further characterized two previously reported genes, CYF1P1 and NIPA2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four genes are in the region close to the proximal/centromeric deletion breakpoint (BP1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GOLGA8E belongs to the golgin subfamily of coiled-coil proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six out of 16 golgin subfamily proteins in the human genome have been mapped in the chromosome 15q11-q13 and 15q24-q26 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have also identified more than 38 copies of GOLGA8E-like sequence in the 15q11-q14 and 15q23-q26 regions which supports the presence of a GOLGA8E-associated low copy repeat (LCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the 15q11-q13 region by PFGE also revealed a polymorphic region between BP1 and BP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WHDC1L1 is a novel gene with similarity to mouse Whdc1 (WAS protein homology region 2 domain containing 1) and human JMY protein (junction-mediating and regulatory protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression analysis of cultured human cells and brain tissues from PWS patients indicates that CYFIP1 and NIPA2 are biallelically expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, we were not able to determine the allele-specific expression pattern for GOLGA8E and WHDC1L1 because these two genes have highly related sequences that might also be expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have presented an updated version of a sequence-based physical map for a complex chromosomal region, and we raise the possibility of polymorphism in the genomic orientation of the BP1 to BP2 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The identification of two new proteins GOLGA8E and WHDC1L1 encoded by genes in the 15q11-q13 region may extend our understanding of the molecular basis of PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In terms of copy number variation and gene organization, this is one of the most polymorphic regions of the human genome, and perhaps the single most polymorphic region of this type </plain></SENT>
