<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until recently, the molecular diagnosis of AS relied on the detection of either a deletion at 15q11-13, a paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) for chromosome 15 or imprinting mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A fourth class of genetic defects underlying AS was recently described and consists of mutations of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of mutations reported so far are predicted to cause major disruptions at the protein level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether mutations with less drastic consequences for the gene product could lead to milder forms of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report on our results obtained by screening 101 clinically diagnosed AS patients for mutations in the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Non-stringent clinical criteria were purposely applied for inclusion of AS patients in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation search was carried out by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and SSCP/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and revealed five novel UBE3A gene mutations as well as three different polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five mutations were detected in patients with typical features of AS and are predicted to cause frameshifts in four cases and the substitution of a highly conserved residue in the fifth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results we obtained add to the as yet limited number of reports concerning UBE3A gene mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Important aspects that emerge from the data available to date is that the four classes of genetic defects known to underlie AS do not appear to cover <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The genetic defect underlying approximately 10% of AS cases, including some familial cases, remains unknown </plain></SENT>
