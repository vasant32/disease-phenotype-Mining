<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present our experience with cross-hybridization of D15Z1, used in combination with D15S10, D15S11 or SNRPN, in 109 clinical cases referred for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> to rule out duplication of 15q11.2, or to identify structural chromosome abnormalities thought to involve chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes studied with at least one of these probe mixtures showed an extra signal with D15Z1 on a chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One case showed absence of the D15Z1 signal from 15p and one case showed an extra signal with D15Z1 on both chromosome 14s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases from this series had structural abnormalities, which included ten cases with supernumerary markers, three of which had a D15Z1 signal on a chromosome 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases did not have an extra signal on chromosome 14, but included rearrangements between Y and 15, 15 and 19, and a r(15), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with breakpoints in 15p11.1 or p11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the three cases with a supernumerary marker and an extra D15Z1 signal on a chromosome 14, one was a maternally derived marker, while the variant 14 was paternal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two markers were de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of variant 14 in cases with supernumerary markers (30%) was not significant by Chi-square analysis compared to the overall frequency in 109 cases of 11.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall frequency is consistent with a previous report by Stergianou et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(1993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We can now add that a false-negative result may occur slightly less than 1% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The chance that both chromosome 14 homologs will be positive for D15Z1 is theoretically about 1 in 300 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If associated with an abnormal phenotype, the possibility of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> should be ruled out </plain></SENT>
