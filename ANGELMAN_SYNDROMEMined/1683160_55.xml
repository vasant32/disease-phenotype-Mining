<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A one-copy density for one or more of the 5 loci was detected in 8 (57.1%) of the 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A deletion of only the D15S11 locus was detected in one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patient, that involving only the D15S10 in 3 familial patients (sibs in a family), that spanning 3 loci (D15S11, D15S10, D15S12) in one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patient, and that spanning 4 loci (D15S9, D15S11, D15S10, D15S12) in the other 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deletion common to our patients as well as to the reported patients may be confined to a segment between D15S11 and D15S10, if the 5 loci are ordered as cen-D15S18-(D15S9-D15S11-D15S10)-D15S12-qt er </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This site overlaps but is more distal to the common deletion site in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the family of the 3 sibs, both of the phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mother and maternal grandfather also have deletions of the D15S10 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with the <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> hypothesis for the occurrence of AS, i.e., the lack of a maternally derived locus leads to AS, but may not support a model that AS is the alternative phenotype of PWS at the identical locus </plain></SENT>
