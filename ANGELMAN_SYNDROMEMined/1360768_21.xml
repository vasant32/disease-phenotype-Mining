<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 6 polymorphic DNA markers supported the conclusion that AS sibs inherit the same maternal 15, but often different paternal 15s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data make <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> at a 15q11-13 locus very unlikely and support the hypothesis that familial AS is due to maternal transmission of a mutation within 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
