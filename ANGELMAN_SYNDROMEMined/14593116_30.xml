<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Necdin is a growth suppressor expressed predominantly in postmitotic neurons and implicated in their terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Necdin shows a moderate homology to the MAGE family proteins, the functional roles of which are largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Human genes encoding necdin, MAGEL2 (necdin-like 1), and MAGE-G1 (necdin-like 2) are located in proximal chromosome 15q, a region associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> such as Prader-Willi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, Angelman</z:e> syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The necdin and MAGEL2 genes are subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and suggested to be involved in the etiology of Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared biochemical and functional characteristics of murine orthologs of these necdin-related MAGE proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The colony formation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation analyses revealed that necdin and MAGE-G1, but not MAGEL2, induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_73'>growth arrest</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Necdin and MAGE-G1 interacted with the transcription factor E2F1 via its transactivation domain, repressed E2F1-dependent transcription, and antagonized E2F1-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of N1E-115 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, necdin and MAGE-G1 interacted with the p75 neurotrophin receptor via its distinct intracellular domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, MAGEL2 failed to bind to these necdin interactors, suggesting that MAGEL2 has no necdin-like function in developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p75 translocated necdin and MAGE-G1 in the proximity of the plasma membrane and reduced their association with E2F1 to facilitate E2F1-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that necdin and MAGE-G1 target both E2F1 and p75 to regulate cell viability during brain development </plain></SENT>
