<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of AS were submitted to ophthalmic and orthoptic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>Strabismus</z:hpo>, visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, and iris and fundus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parents were also examined to compare the extent of fundus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 34 patients were identified, representing 3 genetic classes: deletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, and mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527310" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ametropia</z:e> &gt;1 D was present in 97% of cases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> in 9%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> in 76%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000483'>astigmatism</z:hpo> in 94% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>Myopia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003081" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anisometropia</z:e> were found only in the genetic deletion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>Strabismus</z:hpo>, most frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo>, was found in 24 patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> was observed in 18 subjects (53%), with choroidal involvement in 3 cases and isolated iris involvement in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>Hypopigmentation</z:hpo> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 3 genetic classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic alterations in AS were observed more frequently than has been previously reported, except for ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo>, which was observed less frequently </plain></SENT>
