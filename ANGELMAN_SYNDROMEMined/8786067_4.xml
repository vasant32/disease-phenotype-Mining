<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of AS patients (approximately 65%) have a maternal deficiency within chromosomal region 15q11-q13, caused by maternal deletion or paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately 35% of AS patients exhibit neither detectable deletion nor UPD, but a subset of these patients have abnormal methylation at several loci in the 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe here three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> belonging to an extended inbred family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High resolution chromosome analysis combined with DNA analysis using 14 marker loci from the 15ql1-q13 region failed to detect a deletion in any of the three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Paternal UPD of chromosome 15 was detected in one case, while the other two patients have abnormal methylation at D15S9, D15S63, and SNRPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the three patients are distantly related, the chromosome 15q11-q13 haplotypes are different, suggesting that independent mutations gave rise to AS in this family </plain></SENT>
