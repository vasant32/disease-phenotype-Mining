<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with a chromosomal mosaicism involving the X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One cell line is 45,X and the other has a de novo paternally derived dicentric X;15 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her karyotype is therefore 45,X/45,X,dic(X;15)(Xpter--&gt;Xq26.1::15p11--&gt;15 qter) based on G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of 2 centromeres on the derivative X was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a deletion of Xq26.1--&gt;qter was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using DXS52 and DXYS154 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Replication banding studies indicate that the derivative X is late replicating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these studies, it is unclear whether inactivation has spread to proximal 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient has a unique phenotype distinct from Ullrich-Turner or Prader-Willi syndromes, but includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000750'>language delay</z:hpo> which are commonly seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings are contrary to those anticipated since deficiency of paternal genes at 15q12 typically leads to Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of PCR-based polymorphisms of chromosome 15 and X indicates that <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> is not present for the X chromosome or chromosome 15 in either cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that her phenotype results from the interaction of the 2 abnormal genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each abnormality may be diluted by the mosaicism and, in the derivative X line, by the possible variation among cells of inactivation spreading to chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
