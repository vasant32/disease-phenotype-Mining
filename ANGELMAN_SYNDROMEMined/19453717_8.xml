<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> commonly presents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (&gt;80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine the natural history and various treatments of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS in a large population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A detailed electronic survey containing comprehensive questions regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS was conducted through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> Foundation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were responses from 461 family members of individuals with AS, of whom 86% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (60% with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types), the most common being atonic, generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and complex partial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> only were reported in 11% of those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was most common among those with maternal deletions and unknown subtypes, with catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> present in only these two subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> were refractory to medication, with only 15% responding to the first <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug (AED) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most commonly prescribed AED were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> and clonazepam, but lamotrigine and levetiracetam appeared to have similar efficacy and tolerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This is the largest study to date assessing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in AS is considered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">generalized epilepsy</z:e>, there was a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There are few previous data regarding the use of newer AED in AS, and the results of this study suggest that these newer agents, specifically levetiracetam and lamotrigine, may have efficacy similar to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> and clonazepam, and that they appear to have similar or better side-effect profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nonpharmacologic therapies such as dietary therapy and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) also suggest favorable efficacy and tolerability, although further studies are needed </plain></SENT>
