<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In about 70% of cases, AS is caused by de novo maternal deletions at 15q11-q13 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Approximately 2% of AS cases are caused by paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of chromosome 15 (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3) and 2-3% are caused by "imprinting mutations' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 25% of AS cases, no deletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), or methylation abnormality is detectable, and these cases, unlike deletions or UPD, can be familial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases are likely to result from mutations in a gene that is expressed either exclusively or preferentially from the maternal chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have found that a 15q inversion inherited by an AS child from her <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mother disrupts the 5' end of the UBE3A (E6-AP) gene, the product of which functions in protein ubiquitination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have looked for novel UBE3A mutations in nondeletion/non-UPD/non-imprinting mutation (NDUI) AS patients and have found one patient who is heterozygous for a 5-bp de novo tandem duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have also found in two brothers a heterozygous mutation, an A to G transition that creates a new 3' splice junction 7 bp upstream from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> splice junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both mutations are predicted to cause a frameshift and premature termination of translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that UBE3A mutations are one cause of AS and indicate a possible abnormality in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during brain development in this disease </plain></SENT>
