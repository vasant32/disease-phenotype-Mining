<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty seven referrals with Prader-Willi syndrome and 49 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution cytogenetics was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies, performed on the proband and both parents in each case, utilised multiple probes from within and distal to the 15(q11-13) region in order to establish the presence of DNA deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, FISH, with probes at D15S11 and GABR beta 3 from the Prader-Willi syndrome/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> region, was performed on a subset of 25 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the referral group with Prader-Willi syndrome, 62 patients had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and 25 were deleted on high resolution cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty nine were found to be deleted with DNA techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> group, 37 had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and 12 were deleted on high resolution cytogenetics while 26 were deleted on molecular studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was reassessed in 35 referrals with Prader-Willi syndrome and 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> following a non-deleted, non-disomic result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of individuals who were neither deleted nor disomic on DNA studies, a false positive rate of 11.4% (4/35) for Prader-Willi syndrome and 16.7% (2/12) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> was found for a cytogenetically detected deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The false negative rate for deletion detected on high resolution cytogenetics was 19.5% (12/62) for Prader-Willi syndrome and 35% (13/37) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus high resolution cytogenetics was shown to be unreliable for deletion detection and should not be used alone to diagnose either syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no discrepancies with FISH in 25 cases when FISH was compared with the DNA results, indicating that FISH can be used reliably for deletion detection in both syndromes </plain></SENT>
