<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paternally inherited UBE3A gene is silenced, a process mediated by an antisense transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a trial using methylation-promoting dietary supplements (betaine, metafolin, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, and vitamin B(12) ) in an attempt to reduce antisense transcript production, increase UBE3A expression, and ameliorate the symptoms of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological evaluations, biochemical testing, and assessment of DNA methylation were performed at the beginning and at the end of 1 year of supplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measures were changes in the level of developmental function (cognitive, motor, and language) as measured using standardized instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcomes measures were changes in biochemical parameters and global DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data were compared to those of a control group from a previous randomized double-blind trial using <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and betaine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant changes in the developmental performance of children treated with supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no unexpected changes in biochemical parameters and no change in site-specific DNA methylation when comparing samples from before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 10 adverse events that resulted in study withdrawal of 7 participants (worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, or worsening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002019'>constipation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supplementation with betaine, metafolin, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>, and vitamin B(12) appears safe but ineffective in decreasing the severity of AS </plain></SENT>
