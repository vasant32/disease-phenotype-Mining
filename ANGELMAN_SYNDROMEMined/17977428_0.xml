<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before that time these patients were thought to suffer from neurologic sequelae of perinatal asphyxia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is based on the following criteria: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> from early age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001344'>absent speech</z:hpo> (or speech limited to less than six words), <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>jerky movements</z:mp> with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo> if the patient is walking, paroxysm of inappropriate laughing, dysmorphic craniofacial features (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo>, mid-facial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000490'>deep set eyes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>macrostomia</z:hpo>, prominent mandible) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies suggest that de novo deletion of chromozome 15 is connected with the low recurrence risk and that families with several members with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> belong to the group without identifiable deletion on citogenetic or molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The article deals with the diagnostic criteria, clinical features and electroencephalographic changes (after several years of followup) in seven children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman's syndrome</z:e> (four girls and three boys) </plain></SENT>
