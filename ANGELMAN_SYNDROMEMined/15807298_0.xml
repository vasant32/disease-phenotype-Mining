<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are distinctive diseases with severe impairment of psychomotoric development and behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both syndromes are caused by the loss of paternal (PWS) or maternal (AS) gene expression of chromosomal region 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The work reveals the various causes of this loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The choice of the most suitable method for screening of the genome mutations in the patients suspected of PWS and AS is another purpose of the work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> specific analysis (MS PCR) in locus SNRPN, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of 55 patients tested for PWS and AS only maternal allele was present in 11 patients and only paternal allele was present in 1 patient in the locus SNRPN: 10 microdeletions 15q11-13, 1 UPD(15)mat and 1 UPD(15)pat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MS PCR seems to be the most profitable method for the first step of selection of PWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In positive cases is inevitable to use also additional tests of molecular diagnosis to distinguish the particular mechanism leading to the disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In AS patients is also MSPCR recommended as the first step although it is necessary to exclude mutation in UBE3A gene in case of MS PCR negativity </plain></SENT>
