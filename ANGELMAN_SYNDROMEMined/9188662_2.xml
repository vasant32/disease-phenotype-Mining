<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on two instances of familial recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> which, from pedigree analysis, appear incompatible with currently known mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these two families, deletion-positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> has recurred in cousins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several established mechanisms for deletion-positive familial recurrence have been ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each family, molecular cytogenetic studies show typical chromosome 15 deletions, and DNA methylation analysis verifies the maternal origin of the deleted chromosomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the mothers of the affected individuals in each family are not known to be related, these recurrences appear to be secondary to coincidental, de novo events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is consistent with direct and indirect estimates of the population frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
