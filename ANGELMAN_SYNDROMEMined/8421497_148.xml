<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations at p cause a reduction of eumelanin (black-brown) pigment and altered <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of black pigment granules (eumelanosomes), but have little effect on pheomelanin (yellow-red) pigment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that the human complementary DNA DN10, linked to the p locus in mice, identifies the human homologue (P) of the mouse p gene, and appears to encode an integral membrane transporter protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of this gene in various p mutant mice correlates with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> phenotype; moreover, an abnormally sized <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> is detected in one mutant, p(un), which reverts to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size in p(un) <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertants</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The human P gene corresponds to the D15S12 locus within the chromosome segment 15q11-q13, which is typically deleted in patients with Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (see ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 for review) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These disorders are phenotypically distinct, depending on the parent of origin of the deleted chromosome, but both syndromes are often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation of the skin</z:hpo>, hair and eyes (see ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>8 for review), and deletion of the P gene may be responsible for this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, we report a mutation in both copies of the human P gene in one case of tyrosinase-positive (type II) oculocutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo>, recently linked to 15q11-q13 (ref </plain></SENT>
