<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>E6-AP is a founding member of HECT (homologous to E6-AP C terminus) domain subfamily of E3 ubiquitin ligases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It degrades <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor p53 in association with the E6 oncoprotein of the human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are conflicting reports on its role in the degradation of p53 in the absence of E6 oncoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the role of E6-AP in regulation of p53 in mouse neuro 2a cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of E6-AP in neuro 2a cells increased the ubiquitylation and degradation of p53, which could be prevented upon deletion of HECT domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E6-AP also directly ubiquitylated p53 in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial knockdown of E6-AP increased the levels of p53 and p53-dependent transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Partial knockdown also increased neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which may be mediated partly via p53 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our result suggests that E6-AP not only enhances the degradation of p53 but also regulates the neuronal cell growth </plain></SENT>
