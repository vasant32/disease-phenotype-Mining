<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 193 microclones analyzed with Southern blot hybridization on hybrid cell panels, 26 (13.5%) were either single-copy (unique) or low-repetitive fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By screening of a cosmid library of human genomic DNA using the 26 microclones as probes, 47 positive cosmids were obtained and underwent regional mapping with chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cosmids gave FISH signals at 15p-cen, 5 at 15q11-q13, 6 at 15q22-q26, 3 at other chromosomes, and 17 no signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 27 cosmids mapped to chromosome 15 are useful additions to the inventory of DNA markers of this chromosome including the much interested Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region </plain></SENT>
