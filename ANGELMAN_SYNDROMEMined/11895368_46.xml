<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBE3A encodes UBE3A/E6-AP, a ubiquitin-protein ligase, and shows brain-specific imprinting, with brain expression predominantly from the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lack of a functional maternal allele of UBE3A causes AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to understand the causal relationship between maternal UBE3A mutations and AS, we have constructed a mouse model with targeted inactivation of Ube3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inactive allele contains a lacZ reporter gene for analysis of brain-specific imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maternal, but not paternal, transmission of the targeted allele leads to beta-galactosidase activity in hippocampal and cerebellar neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the Ube3a mutant allele also causes impaired performance in tests of motor function and spatial learning, as well as abnormal hippocampal EEG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As predicted from the dependence of UBE3A-mediated ubiquitination of p53 on HPV E6 protein, our maternal-deficient mice show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain p53 levels </plain></SENT>
