<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS subjects have severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> for which there are no therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mouse models (knockouts of the maternal Ube3a gene: 'AS mice') of the disorder have substantial deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we report a clinically plausible pharmacological treatment that ameliorates both deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AS mice were injected ip twice daily for 5 days with vehicle or the ampakine CX929; drugs of this type enhance fast EPSCs by positively modulating AMPA receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Theta burst stimulation (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>) produced a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> enhancement of field EPSPs in hippocampal slices prepared from vehicle-treated AS mice but LTP decreased steadily to baseline; however, LTP in slices from ampakine-treated AS mice stabilized at levels found in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="127105">TBS</z:chebi>-induced actin polymerization within dendritic spines, an essential event for stabilizing LTP, was severely impaired in slices from vehicle-treated AS mice but not in those from ampakine-treated AS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term memory scores in a fear conditioning paradigm were reduced by 50% in vehicle-treated AS mice but were comparable to values for littermate controls in the ampakine-treated AS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that AS is associated with a profound defect in activity-driven spine cytoskeletal reorganization, resulting in a loss of the synaptic plasticity required for the encoding of long-term memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, the spine abnormality along with the LTP and learning impairments can be reduced by a minimally invasive drug treatment </plain></SENT>
