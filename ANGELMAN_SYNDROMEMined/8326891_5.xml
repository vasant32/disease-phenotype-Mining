<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterise the molecular abnormalities present in a cohort of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA samples from 10 patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were investigated with molecular probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Family studies were performed by means of DNA polymorphism analysis and densitometric estimation of allele copy number to determine the underlying mutation and its parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine probands were shown to have molecular (DNA) deletions involving chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphism analyses demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deletions were maternal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of the nine had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes, with deletions only detected after DNA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had inherited both chromosomes 15 from her father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This represented an example of paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> can result from either deletion of the maternally-derived copy of chromosome 15q11-q13 or the presence of two paternally derived copies of chromosome 15, that is, <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA testing allows the identification of deletions that are not seen on cytogenetic analysis and can provide additional information regarding the parental origin of the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>Uniparental disomy</z:mp> is most readily established by DNA studies </plain></SENT>
