<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these cases with an abnormal phenotype, the duplications were maternally derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Paternal origin of the duplication has been associated with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on a patient who presented with nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of the rostral corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using probes specific for the PWS/AS region demonstrated a double signal on one chromosome 15, indicating the presence of an interstitial duplication of proximal 15q involving the PWS/ AS region in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parental chromosomes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with FISH studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the SNRPN locus showed a maternal band at 4.2 kb and a paternal band of apparent double intensity at 0.9 kb, suggestive of one copy of the maternal allele and two copies of the paternal allele in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis was informative at the GABRB3 locus in the family, which showed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of two different paternal alleles and a maternal allele in the patient consistent with the origin of this duplication from an unequal crossing over between the two chromosome 15 homologs in the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of an abnormal phenotype associated with a paternally derived duplication of proximal 15q shown to contain the PWS/AS region by molecular techniques </plain></SENT>
