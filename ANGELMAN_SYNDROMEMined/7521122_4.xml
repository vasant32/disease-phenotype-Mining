<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When metaphases were hybridized with Prader-Willi and Angelman loci-specific probes by the FISH technique, two sites were noted at opposite positions on the marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alphoid satellite DNA probe documented the isodicentric nature while retention of the p arms on both sides of the marker chromosome was demonstrated by beta satellite probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient does not exhibit manifestations of either syndrome despite the presence of these loci in tetrasomic dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present investigation suggests that other marker chromosomes be reevaluated, as their clinical manifestations are quite variable </plain></SENT>
