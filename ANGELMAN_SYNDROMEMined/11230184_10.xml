<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes within the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region of human chromosome 15q11-q13 are regulated by a mechanism involving allele-specific DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since transcriptional regulation by DNA methylation involves <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylation, we explored whether differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation exist between the two parental alleles of SNRPN and other paternally expressed genes in the region by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with antibodies against acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> H3 and H4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SNRPN exon 1, which is methylated on the silent maternal allele, was associated with acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> on the expressed paternal allele only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SNRPN intron 7, which is methylated on the paternal allele, was not associated with acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> on either allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The paternally expressed genes NDN, IPW, PWCR1 and MAGEL2 were not associated with acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> on either allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of the lymphoblastoid cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46024">trichostatin A</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> deacetylase inhibitor, did not result in any changes to SNRPN expression or association of acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> with exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), which inhibits DNA methylation, resulted in activation of SNRPN expression from the maternal allele, but was not accompanied by acetylation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our finding of allele-specific association of acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi> with the SNRPN exon 1 region, which encompasses the imprinting center, suggests that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation at this site may be important for regulation of SNRPN and of other paternally expressed genes in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the silent allele, 5-aza-dC treatment altered SNRPN expression, but not association with acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histones</z:chebi>, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> acetylation is a secondary event in the process of gene reactivation by CpG demethylation </plain></SENT>
