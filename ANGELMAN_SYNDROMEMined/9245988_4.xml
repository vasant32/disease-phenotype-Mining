<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 6% of patients have a paternal imprint on the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the few cases, this is due to an inherited microdeletion, in the 15q11-q13 imprinting center (IC), that blocks the paternal--&gt;maternal imprint switch in the maternal germ line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have determined the segregation of 15q11-q13 haplotypes in nine families with AS and with an imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One family, with two affected siblings, has a microdeletion affecting the IC transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other eight patients, no mutation was found at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two families, the patient and a healthy sibling share the same maternal alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one of these families and in two others, grandparental DNA samples were available, and the chromosomes with the imprinting defect were found to be of grandmaternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that germ-line mosaicism or de novo mutations account for a significant fraction of imprinting defects, among patients who have an as-yet-undetected mutation in a cis-acting element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, these data may indicate that some imprinting defects are caused by a failure to maintain or to reestablish the maternal imprint in the maternal germ line or by a failure to replicate the imprint postzygotically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Depending on the underlying cause of the imprinting defect, different recurrence risks need to be considered </plain></SENT>
