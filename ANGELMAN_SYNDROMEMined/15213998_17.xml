<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of the UBE3A gene from the maternal chromosome is essential to prevent AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AS is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, and a defined behavioral pattern characterized mainly by happy/sociable disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study used the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales to examine the cognitive abilities and adaptive behavior of children (n = 20) with the four known molecular classes of AS, including patterns of strengths and weaknesses across adaptive behavior domains, and the relationship between adaptive behavior and overall cognitive abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cognitive skills fell within the severe to profound range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in cognitive skills according to genetic subtype only partially supported previous research and suggest that there is overlap in abilities across genetic subtypes of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adaptive behavior skills were also significantly delayed, with participants demonstrating a significant strength in socialization, and a <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in motor skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strong, positive correlations emerge between cognitive ability scores and adaptive behaviors scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide further delineation of a cognitive/behavioral phenotype in AS </plain></SENT>
