<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients, including two sibs, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (AS; three females and three males, aged 11 to 18 years) were studied cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution banding technique, we detected a microdeletion in the proximal region of chromosome 15q in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The deleted segment was heterogenous between these patients, and the common deleted region appeared to be 15q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients with deleted 15q were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, whereas in the sib cases we could not detect a visible deletion in the long arm of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was no clinical difference between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases and sib cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Densitometric analysis of autoradiographic bands of Southern hybridization using two DNA segments, pML34 and pTD3-21, as probes demonstrated that two patients had only one copy for each of the probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining four patients, including the sibs, two copies of each sequence were retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The probes used here detect a molecular deletion in most Prader-Willi syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus the segment causing AS is localized adjacent to the critical segment of Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There seemed to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for the molecular deletion within AS individuals </plain></SENT>
