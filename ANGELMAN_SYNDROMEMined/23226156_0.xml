<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristic feature of imprinted genes, their monoallelic, parental-origin-dependent expression, is achieved through complex epigenetic regulation, which is modulated by ncRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This minireview focuses on two imprinted gene clusters, in which changes in ncRNA expression contribute to human disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the GNAS locus loss of NESP <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>Pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> type 1b (AD-PHP-Ib), while at the SNRPN-UBE3A locus a long ncRNA and processed snoRNAs play a role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman-Syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ncRNAs silence overlapping protein-coding transcripts in sense or anti-sense orientation through changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications as well as DNA methylation at CpG-rich sequence motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their epigenetic modulatory functions are required in early development in the pre-implantation embryo or already in the parental germ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether the sequence homology-carrying ncRNA itself is required, or whether the process of its transcription through other promoters causes the silencing effect </plain></SENT>
