<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The imprinted SNRPN locus is a complex transcriptional unit that encodes the SNURF and SmN <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> as well as multiple non-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SNRPN is located within the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PWS/AS) region that contains multiple imprinted genes, which are coordinately regulated by a bipartite imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SNRPN 5' region co-localizes with the PWS-IC and contains two DNase I hypersensitive sites, DHS1 at the SNRPN promoter, and DHS2 within intron 1, exclusively on the paternally inherited chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have examined DHS1 and DHS2 to identify cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements within the endogenous SNRPN 5' region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of DHS1 by in vivo footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified allele-specific interaction with multiple regulatory proteins, including NRF-1, which regulates genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and metabolic functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DHS2 acted as an enhancer of the SNRPN promoter and contained a highly conserved region that showed allele-specific interaction with unphosphorylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> polymerase II, YY1, Sp1 and NRF-1, further suggesting a key role for NRF-1 in regulation of the SNRPN locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that one or more of the regulatory elements identified in this study may also contribute to PWS-IC function </plain></SENT>
