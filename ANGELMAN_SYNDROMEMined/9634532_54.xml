<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are caused by the loss of function of imprinted genes in proximal 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In approximately 2%-4% of patients, this loss of function is due to an imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some cases, the imprinting defect is the result of a parental imprint-switch failure caused by a microdeletion of the imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the molecular analysis of 13 PWS patients and 17 AS patients who have an imprinting defect but no IC deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heteroduplex and partial sequence analysis did not reveal any point mutations of the known IC elements, either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases, and some share the paternal (PWS) or the maternal (AS) 15q11-q13 haplotype with an unaffected sib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each of five PWS patients informative for the grandparental origin of the incorrectly imprinted chromosome region and four cases described elsewhere, the maternally imprinted paternal chromosome region was inherited from the paternal grandmother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the grandmaternal imprint was not erased in the father's germ line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In seven informative AS patients reported here and in three previously reported patients, the paternally imprinted maternal chromosome region was inherited from either the maternal grandfather or the maternal grandmother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter finding is not compatible with an imprint-switch failure, but it suggests that a paternal imprint developed either in the maternal germ line or postzygotically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude (1) that the incorrect imprint in non-IC-deletion cases is the result of a spontaneous prezygotic or postzygotic error, (2) that these cases have a low recurrence risk, and (3) that the paternal imprint may be the default imprint </plain></SENT>
