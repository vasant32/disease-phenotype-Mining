<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals with AS fail to inherit a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> active maternal copy of the gene encoding ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UBE3A is transcribed predominantly from the maternal allele in brain, but is expressed from both alleles in most other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that brain-specific silencing of the paternal UBE3A allele is mediated by a large (&gt;500 kb) paternal non-coding antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are several other examples of imprinting regulation involving antisense transcripts that share two main properties: (i) the sense transcript is repressed by antisense and (ii) the interaction between sense and antisense occurs in cis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that, in a mouse model of AS, maternal transmission of Ube3a mutation leads to increased expression of the paternal Ube3a-ATS, suggesting that the antisense is modulated by sense rather than the reciprocal mode of regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observation that Ube3a regulates expression of Ube3a-ATS in trans is in contrast to the other cases of sense-antisense epigenetic cis-interactions and argues against a major role for Ube3a-ATS in the imprinting of Ube3a </plain></SENT>
