<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the first microarray analysis of gene expression in AS using a custom cDNA microarray to compare expression patterns from lymphoblastoid cell lines from control males and AS subjects with a 15q deletion or uniparental paternal disomy 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression patterns of genes known to be biallelically expressed or paternally or maternally expressed were consistent with expectations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected paternal or maternal allelic bias in the expression of several genes and transcripts (e.g., GABRA5, GABRB3, WI-14946) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mechanisms controlling paternal allele expression appear to be faithfully replicated in each paternal chromosome in individuals with paternal disomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that interconnected mechanisms can produce subtle and unexpected changes in gene expression that may help explain the phenotypic differences observed among the genetic subtypes of AS </plain></SENT>
