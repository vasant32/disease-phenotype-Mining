<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The family includes 14 affected patients born from four sisters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mutation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving affected individuals and their mothers pointing out the importance of genetic counseling possibility in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Minor clinical expression variation was observed among the investigated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of clinical expression is related to the detected molecular variation: deletion of 15 bp and insertion of 7 bp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results are concordant with the gene expression observed in previously reported individuals with AS and truncated UBE3A protein </plain></SENT>
