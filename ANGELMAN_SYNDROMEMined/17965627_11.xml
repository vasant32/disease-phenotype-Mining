<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the genes responsible for some of these disorders have been identified, how the mutations of these genes affect neural development is currently unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence suggest that these disorders share common underlying defects in neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, synaptic connectivity and brain plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, alterations in dendritic branching and spine <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> play a central role in the pathophysiology of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> disorders, suggesting that common pathways regulating neuronal function may be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic modulations, mediated by DNA methylation, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-associated silencing, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modification, can serve as an intermediate process that imprints dynamic environmental experiences on the "fixed" genome, resulting in stable alterations in phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disturbance in epigenetic regulations can lead to inappropriate expression or silencing of genes, causing an array of multi-system disorders and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e>, the most common form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> in young girls, is due to l mutation of MECP2, encoding a methylated DNA binding protein that translates DNA methylation into gene repression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> is due to faulty <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> or maternal mutations in UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Fragile X Syndrome</z:e>, in most cases, results from the hypermethylation of FMR1 promoter, hence the loss of expression of functional FMRP protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo>, with its complex etiology, may have strong epigenetic link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together, these observations strongly suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play a critical role in brain development and etiology of related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes the scientific discussions and major conclusions from a recent conference that aimed to gain insight into the common molecular pathways affected among these disorders and discover potential therapeutic targets that have been missed by looking at one disorder at a time </plain></SENT>
