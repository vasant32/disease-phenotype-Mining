<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the marker chromosomes displayed two copies of each probe, while in the remaining 11 markers no hybridization was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between the presence of this region and an abnormal phenotype (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the largest study to date of inv dup(15) chromosomes, that uses molecular cytogenetic methods and is the first to report a significant association between the presence of a specific chromosomal region in such markers and an abnormal phenotype </plain></SENT>
