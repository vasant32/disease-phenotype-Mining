<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of PWS or AS appears to depend on the parental origin of the aberrant chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Substantial clinical overlap has not been reported between deletion-positive PWS and AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we report the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings in three AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first patient is a mentally retarded woman with a visible deletion of 15q11-13 with typical craniofacial, behavioral, and neurologic changes of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient is hyperphagic, and she is moderately <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> for her height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her hands and feet are small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These manifestations are more characteristic of PWS and not of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The molecular studies showed deletions of maternal origin for five distal PWCR loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most proximal locus, D15S18, was not deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are identical to those found in our third AS patient who does not have any PWS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> with consequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and the AS phenotype in a patient with a del 15(q11-13) of maternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These clinical findings suggest that overlap in the symptoms of PWS and AS can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our second AS patient presents with atypical molecular findings in that he cannot be classed into any of the three proposed sub-groups of AS patients and may be representative of a fourth sub-group of AS patients </plain></SENT>
