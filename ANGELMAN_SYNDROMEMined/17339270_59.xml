<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human chromosome 15q11-13 is a complex locus containing imprinted genes as well as a cluster of three <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor subunit (GABR) genes-GABRB3, GABRA5 and GABRG3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletion or duplication of 15q11-13 GABR genes occurs in multiple human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GABRB3 protein expression is also reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>), caused by mutations in MECP2 on Xq28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although Gabrb3 is biallelically expressed in mouse brain, conflicting data exist regarding the imprinting status of the 15q11-13 GABR genes in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using coding single nucleotide polymorphisms we show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three GABR genes are biallelically expressed in 21 control brain samples, demonstrating that these genes are not imprinted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, four of eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and one of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> brain samples showed monoallelic or highly skewed allelic expression of one or more GABR gene, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation of these genes is common to both disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of PWS and AS samples with paternal and maternal 15q11-13 deletions revealed a paternal expression bias of GABRB3, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> brain samples showed a significant reduction in GABRB3 and UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing in SH-SY5Y <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells demonstrated that MeCP2 binds to methylated CpG sites within GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies demonstrated that homologous 15q11-13 pairing in neurons was dependent on MeCP2 and was disrupted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined, these results suggest that MeCP2 acts as a chromatin organizer for optimal expression of both alleles of GABRB3 in neurons </plain></SENT>
