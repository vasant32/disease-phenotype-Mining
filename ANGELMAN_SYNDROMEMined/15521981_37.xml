<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternally, but not paternally, derived defects, such as duplications, within the AS critical region result in autistic symptomatology, suggesting that the UBE3A gene might be implicated in the causation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> in AS in 19 children representing three known molecular classes of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children were studied over the course of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of this population, eight of 19 children, met criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> according to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parents of children who were diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Mental Disorders</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>)-IV criteria as well as the ADOS - Generic, Module 1 (ADOS-G) were administered the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data from the ADI-R were convergent with data from the ADOS-G in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with comorbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and AS scored lower on measures of language, adaptive behavior, and cognition, and demonstrated a slower rate of improvement over the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they demonstrated deficits in communication and socialization that mirror those observed in children with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study highlights the phenotypic overlap between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and AS and increases the probability that dysregulation of UBE3A may play a role in the causation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
