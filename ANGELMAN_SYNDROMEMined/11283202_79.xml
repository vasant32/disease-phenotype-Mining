<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty five percent of patients with AS have an identifiable genetic abnormality of chromosome 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X linked</z:hpo> MECP2 gene have been identified in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> which affects females almost exclusively and which shares phenotypic overlap with AS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the diagnosis, it was possible to elicit a history of regression in three of these patients, who by then were showing features suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two subjects the clinical phenotype was still considered to be Angelman-like </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings illustrate the phenotypic overlap between the two conditions and suggest that screening for MECP2 mutations should be considered in AS patients without a demonstrable molecular or cytogenetic abnormality of 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since MECP2 mutations almost always occur de novo, their identification will substantially affect genetic counselling for the families concerned </plain></SENT>
