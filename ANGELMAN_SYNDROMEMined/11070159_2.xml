<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman's (AS) syndromes are two distinct clinical entities caused by alterations in an identical but differentially methylated region of DNA on chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Highly complex laboratory tests are required for diagnosis because the disorders are caused by several genetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) is a relatively simple alternative method to detect the methylation status of the PWS/AS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi>, with alterations to the published method in which a neutralization step after the alkali treatment of the modified DNA enabled the use of the modified product directly in the PCR, eliminating the need for <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiplex MSPCR using primers to methylated and unmethylated DNA was optimized to yield equal amplification efficiency for both products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete concordance was observed during the clinical validation of 40 previously characterized samples, except for one patient with mosaic AS detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have developed and validated a multiplex MSPCR assay with alterations of the original published protocol that is technically robust and reproducible and can be used as a screening assay to detect PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
