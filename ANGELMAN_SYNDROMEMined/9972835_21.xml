<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controlling for the higher IQs of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> group, deleted cases showed significantly higher maladaptive ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist's Internalizing, Externalizing, and Total domains as well as more symptom-related distress on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale </plain></SENT>
