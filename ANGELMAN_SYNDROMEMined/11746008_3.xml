<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and a complex karyotype with cells containing up to three morphologically distinct supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) in most metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies using chromosome 15-specific probes characterised the presence of seven SMCs <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> derived from chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the patient originally had a large inv dup(15) containing two copies of the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region which became mitotically unstable, and by a process of dynamic mosaicism various morphologically distinct SMCs arose </plain></SENT>
