<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis of ours and published patients showed that in UPD, when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> occurred, it was milder compared to patients with deletion, although a suggestive EEG was observed in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that UPD patients do not completely fit the scenario delineated for AS, suggesting that patients determined by different mechanisms should be distinctly addressed, for a better understanding of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
