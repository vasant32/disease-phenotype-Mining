<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletions of 15q11.2-q12 are associated with either the Prader-Willi (PWS) or Angelman (AS) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that excessive recombination in this region might explain the high frequency of such deletions, and the frequent involvement of chromosome 15 in translocations and nondisjunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied recombination in the PWS region by linkage analysis of non-PWS families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No recombination was found (with maximum lod scores greater than 3.0) for most pair-wise combinations of probes: 39, IR4-3R, ML34, 189-1, 3-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 'hotspot' of recombination is observed between loci detected by p3-21 and pIR10-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The female recombination fraction in this region was significantly higher than that for males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Close linkage with 0.06 recombination was found for the IR10-1 and CMW-1 pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No excess recombination was found between sites bounding common breakpoints observed in deletions associated with PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that these deletions form frequently because of the presence of duplicated DNA sequences and/or inversions in this region, and not because of a high rate of homologous recombination </plain></SENT>
