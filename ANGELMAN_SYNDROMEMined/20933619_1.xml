<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the clinical relevance of this unknown variant, we determined the parental origin and the functional consequences of the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We separated the two chromosomes 15 by microdissection of metaphase spreads and used cytogenetic and molecular markers to demonstrate that the deletion is on the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For determining the functional consequences of the deletion, we modelled the structure of the deletion mutant based on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> X-ray structure and simulated the molecular dynamics of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> and mutant protein in complex with UcbH7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our simulations showed that deletion of G538 destroys a network of salt bridges between highly conserved residues in the catalytic cleft of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that the 3bp deletion is a loss-of-function mutation of the maternal UBE3A allele that has caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study may serve as a paradigm to determine the parental origin of a de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
