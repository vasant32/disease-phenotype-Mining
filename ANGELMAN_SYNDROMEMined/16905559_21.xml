<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human UBE3A was expressed in Drosophila heads to identify proteins differentially regulated in UBE3A-expressing versus <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using two-dimensional gel and MALDI-TOF analysis, we detected 20 proteins that were differentially regulated by over-expression of human UBE3A in Drosophila heads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One protein responsive to UBE3A was the Rho-GEF pebble (pbl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present three lines of evidence suggesting that UBE3A regulates Pbl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, we show genetic evidence that UBE3A and the Drosophila de-ubiquitinase fat facets (faf) exert opposing effects on Pbl function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we find that both Pbl and ECT2, the mammalian orthologue of Pbl called epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 oncogene, physically interact with their respective ubiquitin E3 ligases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we show that Ect2 expression is regulated by Ube3a in mouse neurons as the pattern of Ect2 expression is dramatically altered in the hippocampus and cerebellum of Ube3a null mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an orthologous UBE3A post-translational regulatory pathway regulates neuronal outgrowth in the mammalian brain and that dysregulation of this pathway may result in neurological phenotypes including AS and possibly other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
