<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human chromosome 15q11-q13 is a critical region for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and most of the genes are under the condition of imprinting mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PWS results from the loss of expression of paternally expressed genes and AS of maternally expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study molecular studies about a patient with congenital anomalies and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> are analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were analyzed by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These markers exist within 15q11-q13 and distal to 15q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only the maternal D15S986 locus within 15q11-q13 was deleted and other markers were biallelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The result of maternal small region deletion in this patient is different from the typical PWS with paternal chromosome deletion and it suggests that nearby the deleted region there exists a gene (genes) which is not imprinted but needs biallelic expression </plain></SENT>
