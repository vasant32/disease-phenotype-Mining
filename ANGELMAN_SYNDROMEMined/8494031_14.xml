In this study we compared the cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in six children with Angelman and four with Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two syndromes are of special interest because, although they are both caused by deletions in the same region of chromosome 15, Angelman children are far more severely affected, and do not speak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the length of the banks of the Sylvian fissure in a gapless series of thin sagittal images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angelman children had a significantly larger proportion (75%) of anomalous fissures than the Prader-Willi children (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anomalous cortical growth could result from mistimed expression and recognition of macromolecules involved in axonal guidance, target recognition, and pruning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that misrouting of long projection axons may be related to the Sylvian fissure anomalies and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023015" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">language disorder</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
