<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, while there is a considerable amount of data concerning the oncogenic properties of the E6-E6-AP complex, only little is known about the function(s) of E6-AP in neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to the fact that although some E6-AP substrates have been identified, it is at present unclear whether deregulated modification/degradation of these proteins is involved in the pathogenesis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the cellular pathways involving E6-AP remain enigmatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To obtain insights into the physiological functions of E6-AP, we are currently employing several strategies, including quantitative affinity proteomics and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results obtained will eventually allow the introduction of E6-AP into functional protein networks and so reveal potential targets for molecular approaches in the treatment of E6-AP-associated diseases </plain></SENT>
