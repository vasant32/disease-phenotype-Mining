<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ube3a functions as an ubiquitin ligase as well as a transcriptional coactivator of steroid hormone receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which maternal Ube3a deficiency gives rise to phenotypic features of AS are not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report here that Ube3a regulates <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> receptor (GR) transactivation and GR signaling pathway is disrupted in Ube3a-maternal-deficient mice brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of several GR-dependent genes is down-regulated in multiple brain regions of Ube3a-maternal-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AS mice show significantly higher level of blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi>, selective loss of GR and reduced number of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in their hippocampus that could ultimately lead to increased stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These mice also exhibit increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>-like behavior, which could be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress due to altered GR signaling might lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>-like behavior in a mouse of model of AS </plain></SENT>
