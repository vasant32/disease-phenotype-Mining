<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical and cytogenetic findings in consecutive patients submitted to genetic amniocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: An analysis was made of the clinical features, amniocentesis results and pregnancy outcome in 1500 consecutive cases of genetic amniocentesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight fetuses with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chromosomopathy</z:e> (4.5%) were detected and two, with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inborn error of metabolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormalities were <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 (32 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 18 (10 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13(6 cases), 45,X (6 cases), 47,XXY (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy outcome is known in 474 patients (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were five fetal losses (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 68 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chromosomopathy</z:e>, the outcome is known in 45, of which, 29 (64%) decided to have an abortion while 16 (35%) continued the pregnancy, six had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> or perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and ten had an alive new born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among fetuses with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or balanced karyotype and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrasound, 11 out of 419 (2.6%) had congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of them had a condition known to be related with epigenetic regulation, (Russell Silver and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Amniocentesis is a reliable and low risk method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic findings in this series are similar to those reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015929" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal disease</z:e> decided to have an abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The finding of two patients with a condition related with abnormal epigenetic regulation suggests that the magnitude of this risk remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
