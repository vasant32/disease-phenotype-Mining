<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> are complex neurobehavioral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndromes</z:hpo> whose expression depends on the unmasking of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> for different genetic loci in human chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome has been fine-mapped by using interspecific (Mus spretus) crosses and overlapping, radiation-induced deletions to evaluate potential animal models for both imprinted and nonimprinted components of these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four evolutionarily conserved sequences from human 15q11-q13, including two cDNAs from fetal brain (DN10, D15S12h; DN34, D15S9h-1), a microdissected clone (MN7; D15F37S1h) expressed in mouse brain, and the gene for the beta 3 subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> type A receptor (Gabrb3), were mapped in mouse chromosome 7 by analysis of deletions at the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of these loci are deleted in pre- and postnatally lethal p-locus mutations, which extend up to 5.5 +/- 1.7 centimorgans (cM) proximal to p; D15S9h-1, which maps 1.1 +/- 0.8 cM distal to p and is the mouse homolog of the human gene D15S9 (which shows a DNA methylation imprint), is not deleted in any of the p-locus deletion series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transcript from the Gabrb3 gene, but not the transcript detected by MN7 at the D15F37S1h locus, is expressed in mice homozygous for the p6H deletion, which have an abnormal neurological phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Gabrb3 transcript is expressed equally well from the maternal or paternal chromosome 7 and, therefore, its expression is not imprinted in mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletions at the mouse p locus should serve as intermediate genetic reagents and models with which to analyze the genetics and etiology of individual components of human 15q11-q13 disorders </plain></SENT>
