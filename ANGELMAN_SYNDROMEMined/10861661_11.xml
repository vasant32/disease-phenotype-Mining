<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among 25 patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, we detected 21 with deletion and 4 with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), 2 isodisomies originating by postzygotic error, and 1 MII nondisjunction event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was obtained by molecular techniques, including methylation pattern analysis of exon 1 of SNRPN and microsatellite analysis of loci within and outside the 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most manifestations present in deletion patients are those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparing the clinical data from our and published UPD patients with those with deletions we observed the following: the age of diagnosis is higher in UPD group (average 7 3/12 years), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> is more frequent among deletion patients, UPD children start walking earlier (average age 2 9/12 years), whereas in deletion patients the average is 4 (1/2) years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> started later in UPD patients (average 5 10/12 years) than in deletion patients (average 1 11/12 years), weight above the 75th centile is reported mainly in UPD patients, complete absence of speech is more common in the deleted (88.9%) than in the UPD patients because half of the children are able to say few words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, besides the abnormalities already described, the UPD patients have somewhat better verbal development, a weight above the 75th centile, and OFC in the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
