<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was determined by in situ hybridization, using a mouse 7B2 cDNA and an intronic fragment of the corresponding human gene as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The respective locations of SGNE1 in the two species correlate with the conservation of loci between these subregions of mouse chromosome 2 and human chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the human SGNE1 DNA fragment may serve as a molecular probe of this locus in both the Prader-Willi and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, which are often accompanied by submicroscopic chromosomal deletions in the 15q11-15q13 region </plain></SENT>
