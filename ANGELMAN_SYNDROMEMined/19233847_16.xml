<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially the cell tries to refold the unfolded proteins with the help of molecular chaperones, and failure to refold leads to their degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But how this proteolytic machinery recognizes the abnormally folded proteins is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that E6-AP, a HECT domain family ubiquitin ligase implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, interacts with the substrate binding domain of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperones and promotes the degradation of chaperone bound substrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of E6-AP was dramatically induced under a variety of stresses, and overexpression of E6-AP was found to protect against endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of proteasome function not only increases the expression of E6-AP but also causes its redistribution around microtubule-organizing center, a subcellular structure for the degradation of the cytoplasmic misfolded proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>E6-AP is also recruited to aggresomes containing the cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> transmembrane conductance regulator or expanded polyglutamine proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that E6-AP ubiquitinates misfolded luciferase that is bound by Hsp70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that E6-AP functions as a cellular quality control ubiquitin ligase and, therefore, can be implicated not only in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> but also in the biology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> involving protein aggregation </plain></SENT>
