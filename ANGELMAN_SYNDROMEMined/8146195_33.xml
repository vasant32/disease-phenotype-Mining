<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three genes (Gabrg3, Gabra5, and Gabrb3) encoding the gamma 3, alpha 5, and beta 3 subunits of the type A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> receptor, respectively, are known to map near the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus in mouse chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region shares homology with a segment of human chromosome 15 that is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, an inherited neurobehavioral disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By mapping Gabrg3 on a panel of p-locus deletions, we have determined that the order of genes within this cluster is centromere-p(D15S12h)-Gabrg3-Gabra5-Gabrb3-telom ere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like Gabrb3, neither the Gabra5 nor Gabrg3 gene is functionally imprinted in adult mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice deleted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three subunits die at birth with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, although there are rare survivors (approximately 5%) that do not have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> but do exhibit a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, jerky gait, and runtiness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have previously suggested that deficiency of the beta 3 subunit may be responsible for the clefting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most notably, however, in this report we describe mice carrying two overlapping, complementing p deletions that fail to express the gamma 3 transcript, as well as mice from another line that express neither the gamma 3 nor alpha 5 transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, mice from both of these lines are phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and do not exhibit any of the neurological symptoms characteristic of the rare survivors that are deleted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three (gamma 3, alpha 5, and beta 3) subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These mice therefore provide a whole-organism type A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric-acid</z:chebi> receptor background that is devoid of any receptor subtypes that normally contain the gamma 3 and/or alpha 5 subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The absence of an overt neurological phenotype in mice lacking the gamma 3 and/or alpha 5 subunits also suggests that mutations in these genes are unlikely to provide useful animal models for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
