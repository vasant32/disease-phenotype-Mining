<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The genes in 15q11-13 contributing to the full array of the clinical phenotype are not fully identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examines whether a loss or reduction in the GABAA receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3) gene, contained within the AS deletion region, may contribute to the overall severity of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disrupting the gabrb3 gene in mice produces electroencephalographic abnormalities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and behavior that parallel those seen in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that are observed in these mice showed a pharmacological response profile to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> medications similar to that observed in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these mice exhibited learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e>, poor motor skills on a repetitive task, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, and a disturbed rest-activity cycle, features <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common to AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The loss of the single gene, gabrb3, in these mice is sufficient to cause phenotypic traits that have marked similarities to the clinical features of AS, indicating that impaired expression of the GABRB3 gene in humans probably contributes to the overall phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At least one other gene, the E6-associated protein ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) gene, has been implicated in AS, so the relative contribution of the GABRB3 gene alone or in combination with other genes remains to be established </plain></SENT>
