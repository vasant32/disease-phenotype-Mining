<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EEGs, recorded before 5 years of age, of 10 patients with AS, 10 with RS and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> of other origin were studied blindly by two examiners for the presence of the following items: (A) 4-6 Hz rhythmic activity of over 200 microV; (B) 2-3 Hz frontal activity of 200-500 microV; (C) posterior spikes; (D) triphasic frontal waves; (E) central and/or centro-temporal spike-wave complexes; and (F) other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on these items the EEGs were scored as AS (A-D); RS (E-F); or other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examiners never made a mistake between AS and RS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One examiner labeled 6 of 10 AS cases correctly, the other 5; 4 (5) were characterized as 'other.' In RS cases 5 were labeled as 'other' by the first examiner and 3 by the second one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that EEG patterns of AS and RS are sufficiently different to help differentiate between AS and RS at a young age, which has a bearing on genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
