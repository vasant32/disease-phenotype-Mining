<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal phenotypes due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> are associated with UPD for the acrocentric chromosomes 14 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of UPD in a population with acrocentric rearrangements (either an isochromosome or a Robertsonian translocation) and abnormal phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty individuals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 50 rearrangements, two were homologous rearrangements and both showed UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight were non-homologous Robertsonian translocations, of which two showed UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that UPD explains the abnormal phenotypes in some balanced carriers of acrocentric rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results and the large number of case reports in the literature suggest that patients with abnormal phenotypes and acrocentric rearrangements of chromosomes 14 or 15 should be tested for UPD </plain></SENT>
