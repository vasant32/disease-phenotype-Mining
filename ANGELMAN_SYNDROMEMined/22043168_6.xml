<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% of individuals with PWS have a de novo deletion of the paternally derived 15q11-q13 region in which there are two subtypes (i.e., larger Type I or smaller Type II), maternal disomy 15 (both 15s from the mother) in about 25% of cases, and the remaining subjects have either defects in the imprinting center controlling the activity of imprinted genes or due to other chromosome 15 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PWS is characterized by a particular facial appearance, infantile <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002033'>poor suck</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding difficulties</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003241'>hypogenitalism</z:hpo> in both sexes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> and small hands and feet due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000824'>growth hormone deficiency</z:hpo>, mild learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral problems</z:hpo> (e.g., skin picking, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233558" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">temper tantrums</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> leading to early childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWS is considered the most common known genetic cause of morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 15q11-q13 region contains approximately 100 genes and transcripts in which about 10 are imprinted and paternally expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This region can be divided into four groups: 1) a proximal non-imprinted region; 2) a PWS paternal-only expressed region containing protein-coding and non-coding genes; 3) an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region containing maternally expressed genes and 4) a distal non-imprinted region </plain></SENT>
