<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are four classes of AS according to molecular or cytogenetic status: maternal microdeletion of 15q11-q13 (approximately 70% of AS patients); <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD); defects in a putative imprinting centre (IM); the fourth includes 20-30% of AS individuals with biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of allelic methylation in 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations of UBE3A have recently been identified as causing AS in the latter group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Few studies have investigated the phenotypic differences between these classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared 20 non-deletion to 20 age-matched deletion patients and found significant phenotypic differences between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The more severe phenotype in the deletion group may suggest a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
