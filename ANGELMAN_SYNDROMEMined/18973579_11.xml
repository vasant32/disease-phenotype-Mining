<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently reported VFO in slices of mouse cerebellar cortex (Crus I and II of ansiform and paramedian lobules), either in association with gamma oscillations (approximately 40 Hz, evoked by <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>) or in isolation [evoked by <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>)(A) receptor blockade] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The experimental data suggest a role for electrical coupling between Purkinje cells (blockade of VFO by drugs reducing gap junction conductance and spikelets in some Purkinje cells); and the data suggest the specific involvement of Purkinje cell axons (because of field oscillation maxima in the granular layer) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that a detailed network model (1000 multicompartment Purkinje cells) replicates the experimental data when gap junctions are located on the proximal axons of Purkinje cells, provided sufficient spontaneous firing is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike other VFO models, most somatic spikelets do not correspond to axonal spikes in the parent axon, but reflect spikes in electrically coupled axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model predicts gating of VFO frequency by g(Na) inactivation, and experiments prolonging this inactivation time constant, with beta-pompilidotoxin, are consistent with this prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The model also predicts that cerebellar VFO can be explained as an electrically coupled system of axons that are not intrinsic oscillators: the electrically uncoupled cells do not individually oscillate (in the model) and axonal firing rates are much lower in the uncoupled state than in the coupled state </plain></SENT>
