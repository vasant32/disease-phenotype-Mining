<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases are due to an interstitial deletion on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, in the critical region q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rare cases also result from paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a group of 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> AS diagnosed in Switzerland, we found 2 unrelated females with paternal isodisomy for the entire chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their phenotypes were milder than usually seen in this syndrome: one girl did not show the typical AS facial changes; both patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; as they grew older, they had largely undisturbed gross motor functions, in particular no severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both girls were born to older fathers (45 and 43 years old, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apparent association of a relatively milder phenotype in AS with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> will have to be confirmed by detailed clinical descriptions of further patients </plain></SENT>
