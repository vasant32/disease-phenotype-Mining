<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correct diagnosis of AS is important because of its clinical implications, and once the disease is confirmed, familial genetic counseling becomes crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 22 patients with a putative diagnosis of AS by both clinical and molecular cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A deletion of the region 15q11-13 could be identified cytogenetically in 11 cases by high-resolution technique (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four additional cases were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study with D15S11, SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB 3 [Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)/AS region probes] (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The common deletion of GABRB 3 was documented in those AS cases (n = 15) by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other 7 cases exhibited no deletion over 15q11-13 at either the cytogenetic or molecular level (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We compared the following associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e>: <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, sleep and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior problems</z:e>, brain anomalies proved by image studies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034013,C0032939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual precocity</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031941" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pineal tumor</z:e> among the three groups, as well as other clinical conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the differences in neurological and facial characteristics were not distinct among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the associated conditions were more frequently observed in the patients with deletion than in those without deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The EEG features of AS appear to be less sufficient in helping identify patients at an early age before the clinical features become obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a region involved in the major As phenotypes may contain only one or more tightly contiguous genes around the GABRB 3 locus, which may explain the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in AS </plain></SENT>
