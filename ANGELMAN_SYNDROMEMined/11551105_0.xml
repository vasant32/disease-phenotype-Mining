<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methylation testing identifies a significantly higher proportion of patients as compared to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based microdeletion analysis and is thus a useful diagnostic evaluation for clinically suspect, but FISH-negative, patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used two independent PCR-based protocols for methylation testing on fixed cell specimens archived after FISH analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in DNA methylation due to the procedure of cell fixation were ruled out by testing control specimens before and after fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then methylation testing was carried out on 20 standard fixed-cell supsensions from people suspected for PWS or AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These fixed specimens were stored after negative FISH analysis for up to 4 years at 4 degrees C in 3:1 methanol/acetic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation patterns associated with AS (one specimen) and with PWS (one specimen) were identified for both protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed methylation patterns were concordant with the phenotypes of the positive individuals and for the two protocols used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We have, thus, shown that archived fixed-cell suspensions from individuals suspected as PWS or AS that were negative for cytogenetic/FISH microdeletions, can now be re-evaluated with PCR-based methylation testing without the need for additional blood samples from the previously studied individuals </plain></SENT>
