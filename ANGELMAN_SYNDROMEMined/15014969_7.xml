<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed an imprinting assay combining the use of mice carrying maternal or paternal duplication of chromosomal regions of interest with custom oligonucleotide microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a model system, we analyzed <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> tissue of neonatal mice carrying the reciprocal translocation T(7;15)9H and uniparental duplication of proximal Chr 7 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The duplicated region includes the locus on proximal Chr 7 corresponding to the human Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microarray contained 322 oligonucleotides, including probes to detect major genes involved in neural excitability and synaptic transmission, as well as known imprinted genes mapping to proximal Chr 7: Ndn, Snrpn, Mkrn3, Magel2, Peg3, and Ube3a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imprinting of these genes in neonatal cortex and cerebellum was first confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their inclusion on the microarray thus provided positive controls for evaluating the effect of background on the sensitivity of the assay, and for establishing the minimum level of expression required to detect imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our analysis extended previous work by revealing bi-allelic expression in <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> tissue of those queried genes mapping to proximal Chr 7 or 15, including the Gabrb3 gene, for which there have been conflicting reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis also revealed no effect of the maternal or paternal disomy on expression levels of the unlinked genes detected, including those potentially implicated in the Prader-Willi or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, quantitative RT-PCR revealed a gene dosage effect in both cerebellum and cortex for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the known imprinted genes assayed, except for Ube3a in cerebellum </plain></SENT>
