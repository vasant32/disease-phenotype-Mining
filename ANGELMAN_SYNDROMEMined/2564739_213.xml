<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While AS and PWS share a similar cytogenetic anomaly, they have very different clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNAs from 4 AS patients were examined using 5 chromosome 15q11q13-specific cloned DNA segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the present level of resolution, the molecular deletions between AS and those previously reported for PWS did not appear to differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to the paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the deleted chromosome 15 observed in the majority of PWS patients, maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the deleted chromosome 15 was demonstrated in the AS patients by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) </plain></SENT>
