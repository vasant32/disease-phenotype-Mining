<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent case reports have suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> treatment with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may increase the risk of imprinting defects leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although imprinting defects account for only 4% of patients with AS, we have found four cases among 16 AS patients born to <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertile</z:mp> couples, who conceived with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> treatment (25%; relative risk (RR) 6.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 16.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk in untreated couples with time to pregnancy (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) exceeding 2 years was identical to that of those treated by ICSI or by hormonal stimulation alone (RR 6.25; 95% CI 0.70 to 22.57) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was twice as high in couples who had received treatment and also had <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> &gt;2 years (RR 12.5; 95% CI 1.40 to 45.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that imprinting defects and <z:mp ids='MP_0001921'>subfertility</z:mp> may have a common cause, and that superovulation rather than ICSI may further increase the risk of conceiving a child with an imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
