<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most PCR assays for detection of 5-methylcytosine in genomic DNA entail a two-step procedure, comprising initial PCR amplification and subsequent product analysis in separate operations that usually require manual transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These methods generally provide information about methylation of only a few CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> within the target sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An in-tube methylation assay is described that integrates amplification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-treated DNA and melting analysis by using a thermal cycler coupled to a fluorometer (LightCycler) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA melting curves were acquired by measuring the fluorescence of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi>-binding dye (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51461">SYBR Green I</z:chebi>) during a linear temperature transition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of a region comprising 11 CpG sites at the SNRPN promoter CpG island showed that the melting temperature (T(m)) differed by approximately 3 degrees C between unmethylated and fully methylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This assay could easily distinguish patients with Prader-Willi syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> from individuals without these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Melting curve analysis also allowed resolution of methylation "mosaicism" at the p15(Ink4b) promoter in bone marrow samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> samples representing pools of heterogeneously methylated p15(Ink4b) alleles showed broadened melting peaks with overall T(m)s between those of the unmethylated and fully methylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Integration of PCR and fluorescence melting analysis may be useful for simple and cost-effective detection of aberrant methylation patterns </plain></SENT>
