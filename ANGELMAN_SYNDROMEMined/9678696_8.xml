<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternal duplications in 15q11.2-q13 have been found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A population of adults with moderate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002187'>profound mental retardation</z:hpo> was studied to examine the usefulness of PCR based molecular methods in screening for proximal chromosome 15 abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and eighty-five subjects were initially screened at five microsatellite markers with average heterozygosity values of 0.74 (range 0.54-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these subjects, four had a single allele at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five loci, suggestive of a deletion or uniparental isodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four samples were further screened with additional markers located within 15q11.2-q13 as well as markers telomeric to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One subject had <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) and three subjects had a deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine the parental origin of the 15q11-q13 region containing the single haplotype, samples were analysed with a newly developed methylation specific PCR technique at the SNRPN locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Each of the four subjects showed presence of the paternal allele and absence of the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had a phenotype consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> as expected for the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, but the subject with UPD was distinct from the other subjects with an absence of a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and presence of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>undescended testes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> has an estimated population prevalence of 0.008%, at least 1.4% of the moderately to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020796" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">profoundly mentally retarded</z:e> subjects screened were found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
