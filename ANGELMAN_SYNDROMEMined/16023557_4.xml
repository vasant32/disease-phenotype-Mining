<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined 54 patients with deletion-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> using DNA methylation testing and microsatellite polymorphism analysis, and identified three patients with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) and seven patients with imprinting defects (ID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three patients with UPD were shown to have paternal isodisomy 15, which we hypothesized to have arisen from duplication of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients with ID were siblings and carried microdeletions of the imprinting center (IC), while the remaining five patients had no evidence of deletions and represented <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients with UPD and two of the seven patients with ID had not developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only patients displaying <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> were those with ID who had microdeletions at the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data support the previous findings that indicate that patients with UPD and ID may have a milder phenotype of AS </plain></SENT>
