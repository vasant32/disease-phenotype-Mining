<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>D15S63 is one of the loci, on chromosome 15q11-q13, that exhibit parent-of-origin dependent methylation and that is commonly used in the diagnosis of Prader-Willi or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (PWS/AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 28-kb deletion spanning the D15S63 locus was identified in five unrelated patients; in each of them the deletion was inherited from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the five families segregating the deletion were reported to be of Jewish Ashkenazi ancestry, and in the other two families the ancestral origin was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the 28-kb deletion is a benign variant, we screened for the deletion in 137 unselected Ashkenazi individuals and in 268 patients who were referred for molecular diagnosis of PWS/AS, of whom 89 were Ashkenazi and 47 were of mixed origin (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi Jews) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the control group, three individuals were carriers of the deletion; among the patients, three were carriers, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were Ashkenazi Jews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the control group and the Ashkenazi patients, indicating that the deletion is not a cause of PWS- and AS-like syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the 28-kb deletion in the Ashkenazi population was 1/75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since methylation analysis at the D15S63 locus may lead to misdiagnosis, we suggest the use of SNRPN, either in a PCR-based assay or as a probe in Southern hybridization, as the method of choice in the diagnosis of PWS/AS </plain></SENT>
