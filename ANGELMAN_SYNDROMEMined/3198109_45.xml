<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An hypothesis is presented that attempts to explain the tremendous degree of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in these diverse deletion-associated syndromes based on abnormal haplotypes present on the cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis also addresses genetic similarities between patients who have deletion and those who have the inv dup(15) by postulating that these syndromes are caused by relative dosage ratios of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> versus abnormal alleles </plain></SENT>
