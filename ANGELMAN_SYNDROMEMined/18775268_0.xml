<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic clinical criteria have been defined by consensus since 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is caused by deficiency or inactivation of the UB3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is a percentage of cases which satisfy these clinical features but have negative genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We consider it necessary to analyse the patient characteristics and possible phenotype-genotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases which were treated between 1981 and 2007 in a neurology unit and fulfilled the clinical criteria were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic diagnosis was made by methylation testing and fluorescent in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients were studied, nine with positive genetic testing and four with negative testing who completed the clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average age at diagnosis was 37 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases showed acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005469'>Flat occiput</z:hpo>, mouth and maxillary malformations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo>, a happy appearance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> were practically constant characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Speech and walking ability were the areas which showed most deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three of the cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> genetic testing showed less <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and better psychomotor development, particularly in walking ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The phenotypical characteristics of the syndrome should be known before requesting specific genetic testing and to make a diagnosis even in cases with negative genetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The phenotype characteristics that describe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Deletion cases had a worse outcome </plain></SENT>
