<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate cognitive and linguistic development in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Piaget's developmental model was used to evaluate the test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The participants comprised 20 children (14 boys and 6 girls) aged 2-14 years (median age 7.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AS was diagnosed either according to typical clinical criteria or confirmatory genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functioning was evaluated with Griffiths' Mental Development Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Language development was also evaluated with Receptive-Expressive Emergent Language Scale 2 (REEL-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cognitive functioning, based on results on the Performance Scale, never exceeded Piaget's sensorimotor stage, 0-2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median mental age for language development was 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expressive verbal vocabulary consisted of less than 2 words (n = 11), 2-3 words (n = 7) and 4-5 words (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analyses according to REEL-2 did not indicate a consistent discrepancy between impressive and expressive language </plain></SENT>
