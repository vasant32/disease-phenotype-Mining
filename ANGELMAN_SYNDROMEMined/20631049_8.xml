<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The maternal and paternal genomes possess distinct epigenetic marks that distinguish them at imprinted loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to identify imprinted loci, we used a novel method, taking advantage of the fact that <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) provides a system that allows the two parental chromosomes to be studied independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We profiled the paternal and maternal methylation on chromosome 15 using immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA and hybridization to tiling oligonucleotide arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of six individuals with maternal versus paternal UPD15 revealed 12 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Putative DMRs were validated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing, confirming the presence of parent-of-origin-specific methylation marks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We detected DMRs associated with known imprinted genes within the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region, such as SNRPN and MAGEL2, validating this as a method of detecting imprinted loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 DMRs identified, eight were novel, some of which are associated with genes not previously thought to be imprinted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include a site within intron 2 of IGF1R at 15q26.3, a gene that plays a fundamental role in growth, and an intergenic site upstream of GABRG3 that lies within a previously defined candidate region conferring an increased maternal risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data provide a map of parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic modifications on chromosome 15, identifying DNA elements that may play a functional role in the imprinting process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Application of this methodology to other chromosomes for which UPD has been reported will allow the systematic identification of imprinted sites throughout the genome </plain></SENT>
