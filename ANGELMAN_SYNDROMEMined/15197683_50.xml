<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple repeat elements within the region mediate a variety of rearrangements, including interstitial duplications, interstitial triplications, and supernumerary isodicentric marker chromosomes, as well as the deletions that cause Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the molecular structure of these duplication chromosomes, we designed a high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The array contains 79 clones that form a gapped contig across the critical region on chromosome 15q11-q14 and 21 control clones from other autosomes and the sex chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used this array to examine a set of 48 samples from patients with segmental <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> of chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the array, we were able to determine accurately the dosage, which ranged from 1 to 6 copies, and also to detect atypical and asymmetric rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the increased resolution of the array allowed us to position two previously reported breakpoints within the contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that array CGH is a powerful technique to study rearrangements of proximal chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
