<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent molecular cytogenetic studies have elucidated the origin and nature of extra structurally abnormal chromosomes (ESACs) or small supernumerary chromosomes, which are often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of inv dup(15) in a nationwide screening programme for mentally retarded children in Taiwan and tried to correlate the genotype and phenotype in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using D15Z, D15Z1, and the cosmids from the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> chromosome region (PW/ASCR) was performed on 54 patients (0.45%) with ESACs from 11893 probands within a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of them, inv dup(15) was confirmed in 25 children (46.3%) by FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PW/ASCR probes were used to clarify the size and DNA composition of the markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with inv dup(15) chromosomes, containing only the heterochromatin or little euchromatin of the proximal 15q (i.e., pter--&gt;q11:q11--&gt;pter) may have a rather mild or nearly <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> (group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had some features suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, but was considered to be a result of deleted (15)(q12) in the chromosome 15 homologue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional copies within D15S11 through GABRB3 (15q11.2-13) resulted in an abnormal phenotype which involved mental and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> but was different from the classical phenotype of PW/AS (groups 2, 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic behavior</z:e> did occur in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH combined with microsatellite analyses showed that the marker was often of maternal origin in de novo cases (n = 12, 86%), or inherited from the mother in only one familial case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Down-inv dup(15) was mentioned in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unusual features including <z:hpo ids='HP_0009110'>diaphragmatic eventration</z:hpo>, hyperlaxity of joints, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001166'>arachnodactyly</z:hpo>, brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasm</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000078'>genital abnormalities</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp>/palate were noted in those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This observation expands the range of phenotypic expression associated with this relatively common ESAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Marked phenotypic diversities exist in children with inv dup(15), dependent upon the size or genetic composition of the markers, degree of mosaicism, parental origin and familial occurrence or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with a larger inv dup(15) marker chromosome including the PW/ASCR may have a higher risk of abnormalities, but not the typical Prade-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
