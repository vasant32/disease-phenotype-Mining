<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the function of UBE3A has been widely studied, little is known about its paralog UBE3B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using exome and capillary sequencing, we here identify biallelic UBE3B mutations in four patients from three unrelated families presenting an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal-recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000581'>blepharophimosis</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual-disability</z:hpo> syndrome characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>small head circumference</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphisms</z:hpo>, and low cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UBE3B encodes an uncharacterized E3 ubiquitin ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identified UBE3B variants include one frameshift and two splice-site mutations as well as a missense substitution affecting the highly conserved HECT domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disruption of mouse Ube3b leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0010831'>reduced viability</z:mp> and recapitulates key aspects of the human disorder, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> and brain size and a downregulation of cholesterol synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We establish that the probable Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of UBE3B, oxi-1, functions in the ubiquitin/proteasome system in vivo and is especially required under <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data reveal the pleiotropic effects of UBE3B deficiency and reinforce the physiological importance of ubiquitination in neuronal development and function in mammals </plain></SENT>
