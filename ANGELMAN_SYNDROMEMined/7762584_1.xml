<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 15 heteromorphisms, detected with Q- and R-banding and used in conjunction with PWS/AS region-specific probes, can confirm a chromosome deletion and establish origin to predict the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report four de novo cases of an abnormal-appearing chromosome 15 in amniotic fluid samples referred for advanced maternal age or a history of a previous chromosomally abnormal child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes were characterized using G-, Q-, and R-banding, as well as isotopic and fluorescent in situ hybridization of DNA probes specific for the proximal chromosome 15 long arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two cases, one chromosome 15 homolog showed a consistent deletion of the ONCOR PWS/AS region A and B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other two cases, one of which involved an inversion with one breakpoint in the PWS/AS region, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the proximal chromosome 15 long arm DNA probes used in the in situ hybridization were present on both homologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up was not available on these samples, as in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the parents chose to terminate the pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate the ability to prenatally diagnose chromosome 15 abnormalities associated with PWS/AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, they highlight the need for a better understanding of this region for accurate prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
