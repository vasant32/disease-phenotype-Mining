<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the involvement in epigenetic regulation is proposed to involve its chromobarrel and/or Tudor domains because of their potential binding to methylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> tails, the structures of these domains and their interactions with methylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> tails are still uncharacterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this work, we first found that RBBP1 contains five domains by bioinformatics analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of the five domains, i.e. chromobarrel, Tudor, and PWWP domains, are Royal Family domains, which potentially bind to methylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> tails </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further purified these domains and characterized their interaction with methylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> tails by NMR titration experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the three Royal Family domains, only the chromobarrel domain could recognize trimethylated H4K20 (with an affinity of âˆ¼3 mm), as well as recognizing trimethylated H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36 (with lower affinities) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The affinity could be further enhanced up to 15-fold by the presence of DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structure of the chromobarrel domain of RBBP1 determined by NMR spectroscopy has an aromatic cage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis analysis identified four aromatic residues of the cage as the key residues for methylated lysine recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our studies indicate that the chromobarrel domain of RBBP1 is responsible for recognizing methylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> tails in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation, which presents a significant advance in our understanding of the mechanism and relationship between RBBP1-related gene suppression and epigenetic regulation </plain></SENT>
