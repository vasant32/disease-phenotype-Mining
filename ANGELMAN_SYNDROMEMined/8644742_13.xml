<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with AS as a result of an unbalanced cryptic translocation whose breakpoint, at 15q11.2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> within this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proband was diagnosed clinically as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, but without a detectable cytogenetic deletion, by using high-resolution G-banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH detected a deletion of D15S11 (IR4-3R), with an intact GABRB3 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent studies of the proband's mother and sister detected a cryptic reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 14 and 15 with the breakpoint being between SNRPN and D15S10 (3- 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proband was found to have inherited an unbalanced form, being monosomic from 15pter through SNRPN and trisomic for 14pter to 14q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation studies showed that the proband had a paternal-only DNA methylation pattern at SNRPN, D15S63 (PW71), and ZNF127 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mother and unaffected sister, both having the balanced translocation, demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA methylation patterns at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the gene for AS most likely lies proximal to D15S10, in contrast to the previously published position, although a less likely possibility is that the maternally inherited imprinting center acts in trans in the unaffected balanced translocation carrier sister </plain></SENT>
