<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of the EEG in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, to verify the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of suggestive EEGs and to study EEG patterns, analyzing variations and comparing our findings with nomenclature previously used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy EEG and 15 V-EEGs of 26 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Suggestive EEG patterns of AS were classified in delta pattern (DP), theta pattern (TP), and posterior discharges (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Generic terms were used to simplify the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Suggestive EEGs were observed in 25 (96.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DP occurred in 22 patients with four variants-hypsarrhythmic-like: irregular, high-amplitude, generalized delta activity (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010841'>multifocal epileptiform discharges</z:hpo> (EDs); slow variant: regular, high-amplitude, generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> with rare EDs; ill-defined slow spike-and-wave: regular, high-amplitude, generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> with superimposed EDs characterizing a slow wave, with notched appearance; triphasic-like: rhythmic, moderate-amplitude <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> over anterior regions with superimposed EDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TP was observed in eight patients, as generalized or over the posterior regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e> were seen in 19 patients as runs of sharp waves or runs of high-amplitude slow waves with superimposed EDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TP was the only age-related pattern (younger than 8 years) and observed only in patients with deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients who had an EEG before the clinical diagnosis, 60% had a suggestive tracing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although some EEG descriptions are not very detailed, and every author describes findings in a slightly different manner, obviously a common denominator must exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this context, EEG seems to be a very sensitive method for the diagnosis of AS, offering an opportunity to corroborate this etiologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conversely, we do not believe that these patterns may be accounted as specific, except for the delta pattern, which seems to be extremely unusual in other syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Other EEG patterns observed in AS, such as theta activity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PDs</z:e>, occur in a wide variety of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, their importance for the EEG diagnosis of AS is supported by the fact that they are associated with other features and may be helpful in a proper clinical setting </plain></SENT>
