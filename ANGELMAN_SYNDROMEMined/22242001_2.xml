<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS [MIM 17620]) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (AS [MIM 105830]) locus is controlled by a bipartite imprinting center (IC) consisting of the PWS-IC and the AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most widely accepted model of IC function proposes that the PWS-IC activates gene expression from the paternal allele, while the AS-IC acts to epigenetically inactivate the PWS-IC on the maternal allele, thus silencing the paternally expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gene order and imprinting patterns at the PWS/AS locus are well conserved from human to mouse; however, a murine AS-IC has yet to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated a potential regulatory role for transcription from the Snrpn alternative upstream exons in silencing the maternal allele using a murine transgene containing Snrpn and three upstream exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This transgene displayed appropriate imprinted expression and epigenetic marks, demonstrating the presence of a functional AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcription of the upstream exons from the endogenous locus correlates with imprint establishment in oocytes, and this upstream exon expression pattern was conserved on the transgene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A transgene bearing targeted deletions of each of the three upstream exons exhibited loss of imprinting upon maternal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support a model in which transcription from the Snrpn upstream exons directs the maternal imprint at the PWS-IC </plain></SENT>
