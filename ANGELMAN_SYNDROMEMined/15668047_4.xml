<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between the degree of developmental disturbance and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, we investigated 11 patients and measured both clinical outcomes and EEG parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were followed up until after 8 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were found to have 15q11-q13 deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one displayed non-<z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> (NCSE) during the period of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, including NCSE, disappeared by around 8 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges, as measured by EEG, tended to subside with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although development seemed almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only slightly delayed during the first 6 months of life, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients eventually developed severe retardation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients displayed very severe retardation and were unable to comprehend language or walk independently at the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was able to speak a few meaningful words </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one of the most severely affected patients, who showed the earliest <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and NCSE, it is possible that the repetitive bouts of NCSE might be responsible for the severe developmental outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the other patient with particularly severe retardation did not experience NCSE, while the patient with the most favorable outcome had repetitive episodes of NCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the severity of developmental disturbance in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> is not necessarily related to the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, intensive therapy for NCSE might still be justified because there are some patients in whom NCSE results in a transient and sometimes permanent decline in mental and motor functioning </plain></SENT>
