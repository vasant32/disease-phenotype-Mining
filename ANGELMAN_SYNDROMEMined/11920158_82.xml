<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also used four additional markers (69CA, 155CA-1, 85CA, and A55CA-1) localized within 150 kb of 155CA-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of multi-allelic TDT (MTDT) (P &lt; 0.002), as well as the TDT (P &lt; 0.004), demonstrated an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> and 155CA-2 in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meiotic segregation distortion could be excluded as a possible cause for these results since no disequilibrium was observed in unaffected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings support a role for genetic variants within the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> receptor gene complex in 15q11-13 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
