<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predominant genetic defects in PW are 15q11-13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, maternal deletions and paternal chromosome 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> are associated with a different neurogenetic disorder, the AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-13 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 5 patients suspect of PWS and 4 patients suspect of AS who were referred to the Medical Genetics Unit at the University Hospital of Medical School from Ribeir√£o Preto </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to establish the correct clinical and etiological diagnosis in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used conventional cytogenetics, methylation analysis with the probe KB17 (CpG island of the SNRPN gene) by Southern blotting after digestion with the Xba I and Not I restriction enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We studied in patients and their parents the segregation of the (CA)*** repeats polymorphisms by PCR, using the primers 196 and IR4-3R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conventional cytogenetical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirmed 3 cases of PWS: one by de novo deletion, one by maternal chromosome 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and one case with no defined cause determined by the used primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We confirmed 2 cases of AS, caused by de novo deletion at the 15q11-13 region, and one case with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> molecular analysis but with strong clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
