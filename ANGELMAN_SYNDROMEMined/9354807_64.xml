<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurogenetic disorder that results from the absence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> paternal contribution to the 15q11-13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of PWS are a transient severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> in the newborn period, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> observed later in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five transcripts with exclusive expression from the paternal allele have been isolated, but none of these has been shown to be involved in PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of NDN, a new human imprinted gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NDN is exclusively expressed from the paternal allele in the tissues analysed and is located in the PWS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It encodes a putative protein homologous to the mouse brain-specific NECDIN protein, NDN; as in mouse, expression in brain is restricted to post-mitotic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NDN displays several characteristics of an imprinted locus, including allelic DNA methylation and asynchronous DNA replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A complete lack of NDN expression in PWS brain and fibroblasts indicates that the gene is expressed exclusively from the paternal allele in these tissues and suggests a possible role of this new gene in PWS </plain></SENT>
