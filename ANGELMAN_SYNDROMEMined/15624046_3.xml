<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 70% of cases have a paternal deletion at 15q11-q13, and most of the remaining cases are caused by maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rare cases of PWS with maternal UPD, small marker chromosomes are identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with inv dup(15) are at an increased risk of developing PWS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> due to UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They may be also at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> due to additional copies of genes located within the PWS/AS critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, molecular investigations in patients with a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) are necessary to provide proper genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report a female infant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011398'>central hypotonia</z:hpo>, weak crying, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding problems</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis revealed an SMC in 55% of metaphase cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that this marker chromosome was constituted by a small isodicentric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inverted duplication of chromosome 15</z:e> [inv dup(15)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis showed uniparental isodisomy of maternal chromosome 15 in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of PWS was further confirmed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The inv dup(15) marker chromosome was also of maternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at the age of 18 months revealed a height in the 10th percentile and weight in the 50th percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>She had poor activity and muscle tone, and was unable to walk independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, behavior disturbance or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
