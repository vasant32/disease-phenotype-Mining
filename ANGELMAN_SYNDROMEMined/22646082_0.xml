<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A non-randomized pre-test-post-test control group design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervention group consisted of four children with AS aged 3.1-9.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were other children with AS who were individually matched on the basis of chronological age, gender and molecular sub-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children in the intervention group were provided two-to-three <z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>-based therapy sessions per week over a 1-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized measures of cognitive, adaptive and language functioning were administered at baseline and after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at baseline or after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, positive trends were observed in the intervention group for some cognitive and adaptive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="81" ids="2365,53554">ABA</z:chebi>-based intervention improved aspects of neurodevelopment for some children with AS and warrants further study </plain></SENT>
