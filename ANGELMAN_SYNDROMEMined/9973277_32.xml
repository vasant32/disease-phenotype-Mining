<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome with mutations in the imprinting process have biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> but uniparental DNA methylation and gene expression throughout band 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In several of these patients, microdeletions upstream of the SNRPN gene have been identified, defining an imprinting center (IC) that has been hypothesized to control the imprint switch process in the female and male germlines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now identified two large families (AS-O and AS-F) segregating an AS imprinting mutation, including one family originally described in the first genetic linkage of AS to 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that this original linkage is for the 15q11-q13 IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Affected patients in the AS families have either a 5.5- or a 15-kb microdeletion, one of which narrowed the shortest region of deletion overlap to 1.15 kb in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This small region defines a component of the IC involved in AS (ie., the paternal-to-maternal switch element) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of an inherited imprinting mutation in multiple unaffected members of these two families, who are at risk for transmitting the mutation to affected children or children of their daughters, raises important genetic counseling issues </plain></SENT>
