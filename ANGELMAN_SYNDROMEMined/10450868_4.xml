<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (pUPD) of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 6-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> had frequent, but only provoked laughter, was mildly ataxic with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002509'>limb hypertonia</z:hpo>, and had no intelligible speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000490'>deep-set eyes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010808'>protruding tongue</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>prominent chin</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis with microsatellites from chromosome 15 showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of maternal alleles both within and outside the AS critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proximal markers showed reduction to homozygosity of paternal alleles, intermediate markers showed nonreduction, and distal markers reduction, thus suggesting a meiosis II nondisjunction event in the father with two crossovers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is, to our knowledge, the first reported case of AS due to meiosis II nondisjunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We present detailed physical measurements in this patient, adding to the clinical description of the milder phenotype in AS due to pUPD </plain></SENT>
