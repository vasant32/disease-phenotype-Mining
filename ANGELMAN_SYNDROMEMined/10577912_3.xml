<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this test, we have identified a 28-kb deletion spanning D15S63 in five independent families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis revealed identical breakpoints in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The haplotype data are compatible with a common ancestral origin of the deletion in at least two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deletion was not found in 1, 000 unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the deletion maps within the imprinting-center region, neither maternal nor paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the deletion appears to affect imprinting in proximal 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the deletion is a rare neutral variant that can lead to false-positive results in the PW71-methylation test </plain></SENT>
