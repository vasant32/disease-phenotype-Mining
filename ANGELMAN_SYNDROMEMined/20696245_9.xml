<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletion or loss of function of the maternally inherited allele of Ube3a leads to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we show that maternal loss of Ube3a (Ube3a(m-/p+)) in the mouse model leads to motor deficits that could be attributed to the dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra was significantly reduced in Ube3a(m-/p+) mice as compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Ube3a(m-/p+) mice performed poorly in behavioural paradigms sensitive to nigrostriatal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even though the tyrosine hydroxylase staining was apparently the same in the striatum of both genotypes, the presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins were significantly reduced in Ube3a(m-/p+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the abnormality in the nigrostriatal pathway along with the cerebellum produces the observed motor dysfunctions in Ube3a(m-/p+) mice </plain></SENT>
