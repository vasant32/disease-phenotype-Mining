<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the distribution of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE)-1 (L1) along mouse autosomes at a 1-Mb scale, and found a unique combination of high density and strand asymmetry of L1 elements at the imprinted Prader-Willi syndrome/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PWS/AS) locus on mouse chromosome 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This L1 signature overlaps the paternally expressed domain of the locus, excluding the maternally expressed Ube3a gene, and is conserved in rat and human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike the PWS/AS locus, other instances of high L1 density and strand asymmetry in the mouse are not associated with imprinted regions and are not evolutionarily conserved in human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evolutionary conservation of the L1 signature at the PWS/AS locus despite differences in composition of L1 elements between rodent and human, requires a mechanism for active perpetuation of L1 asymmetry during bursts of L1 activity, and indicates a possible functional role for L1 elements at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Aside from the PWS/AS locus, rodents have a far greater correlation of L1 densities between DNA strands than do humans; we provide evidence that this difference in interstrand correlation between the two taxa is due largely to the difference in average age of the dominant L1 families </plain></SENT>
