<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discharges were a common feature, occurring in 43 patients, and did not appear to be related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The discharges, consisting of sharp waves or spikes, were characteristically most prominent around the middle third of the head, often occurring asymmetrically and could be infrequent or almost continuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were usually enhanced by light sleep and were seen only during sleep in 15 EEGs taken in 13 patients, most of whom were under four years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These EEG features when present may help confirm the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> in the appropriate clinical setting and in particular are quite distinct from the usual EEG patterns seen in Angelman (Happy Puppet) syndrome </plain></SENT>
