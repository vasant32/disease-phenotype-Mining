<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, several mutations have been found in the E6-AP ubiquitin protein ligase gene (UBE3A) in a group of patients who are nondeleted and do not have <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> or imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the reported mutations cluster within exons 9 or 16 of the UBE3A gene, and nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> are predicted to give rise to truncated E6-AP ligases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe two AS patients with dissimilar phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, they are both nondeleted, do not display <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, and have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> imprint patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One has the typical AS phenotype and carries the previously reported 1344delAG de novo mutation involving a functionally significant region of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other expresses an atypical phenotype in that she has less severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, no inappropriate laughing, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and her EEG was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 14-bp deletion in the 3' untranslated region of exon 16 (3'UTRdel14) adjacent to the poly(A) signal was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigation revealed that the DNA change was a neutral polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis indicated that both the AS patient and her <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sibling had inherited the same maternal UBE3A gene and its 5' flanking region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the 14-bp change has no functional significance, it assists with counseling to determine future risks of recurrence in this family </plain></SENT>
