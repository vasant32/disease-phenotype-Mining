<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that the E6-associated protein (E6-AP/UBE3A) directly interacts with and coactivates the transcriptional activity of the human <z:chebi fb="28" ids="17026">progesterone</z:chebi> receptor (PR) in a hormone-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E6-AP also coactivates the hormone-dependent transcriptional activities of the other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, it was shown that E6-AP serves the role of a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) in the presence of the E6 protein from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> types 16 and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the ubiquitin-protein ligase function of E6-AP is dispensable for its ability to coactivate nuclear hormone receptors, showing that E6-AP possesses two separable independent functions, as both a coactivator and a ubiquitin-protein ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Disruption of the maternal copy of E6-AP is correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, a genetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech impairment</z:hpo>, and other symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the exact mechanism by which the defective E6-AP gene causes AS remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To correlate the E6-AP coactivator function and ubiquitin-protein ligase functions with the AS phenotype, we expressed mutant forms of E6-AP isolated from AS patients and assessed the ability of each of these mutant proteins to coactivate PR or provide ubiquitin-protein ligase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that in the majority of the AS patients examined, the ubiquitin-protein ligase function of E6-AP was defective whereas the coactivator function was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the AS phenotype results from a defect in the ubiquitin-proteosome protein degradation pathway </plain></SENT>
