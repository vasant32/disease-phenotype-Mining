<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and a 47,XY,+inv dup(15) (pter--&gt;q11::q11--&gt;pter) karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetic studies demonstrated that one of the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 15s was deleted at loci D15S9, GABRB3, and D15S12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no additional copies of these loci on the inv dup(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inv dup(15) contained only the pericentromeric sequence D15Z1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative DNA analysis confirmed these findings and documented a standard large deletion of sequences from 15q11-q13, as usually seen in patients with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation testing at D15S63 showed a deletion of the maternally derived chromosome 15q11-q13 on one of the apparently cytogenetically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 15s, and not by the presence of an inv dup(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the fourth patient with an inv dup(15) and AS or Prader Willi syndrome, who has been studied at the molecular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases an additional alteration of chromosome 15 was identified, which was hypothesized to be the cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with inv dup(15)s may be at increased risk for other chromosome abnormalities involving 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
