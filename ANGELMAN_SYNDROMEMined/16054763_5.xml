<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fast (approximately 160 Hz) cerebellar oscillation has been recently described in different models of ataxic mice, such as mice lacking calcium-binding proteins and in a mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among them, calretinin-calbindin double knockout mice constitute the best model for evaluating fast oscillations in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebellum of these mice may present long-lasting episodes of very strong and stable local field potential oscillation alternating with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> non-oscillating state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous firing of the Purkinje cells in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and double knockout mice largely differs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the Purkinje cell firing of the oscillating mutant is characterized by an increased rate and rhythmicity and by the emergence of synchronicity along the parallel fiber axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To better understand the driving role played by these different parameters on fast cerebellar oscillation, we simultaneously recorded Purkinje cells and local field potential during the induction of general anesthesia by ketamine or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both drugs significantly increased Purkinje cell rhythmicity in the absence of oscillation, but they did not lead to Purkinje cell synchronization or to the emergence of fast oscillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During fast oscillation episodes, ketamine abolished Purkinje cell synchronicity and inhibited fast oscillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi> facilitated fast oscillation, induced and increased Purkinje cell synchronicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that fast cerebellar oscillation is due to the synchronous rhythmic firing of Purkinje cell populations and is facilitated by positive feedback whereby the oscillating field further phase-locks recruited Purkinje cells onto the same rhythmic firing pattern </plain></SENT>
