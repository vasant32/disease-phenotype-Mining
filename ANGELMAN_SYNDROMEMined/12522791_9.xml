<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two unrelated patients each with two supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) derived from chromosome 15, and thus resulting in partial hexasomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hexasomy in the one case (family 1) was diagnosed at prenatal diagnosis and did not include the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The double SMCs were also found in the mother, the pregnancy continued to term, and an apparently phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> child was born </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This represents the first report of transmission of double SMCs from mother to child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second case (family 2), the hexasomy did include the PWACR and was de novo in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient manifested severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, clefting of the soft palate, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-like episodes, and other phenotypic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aberrant phenotype is attributable to the hexasomy for the PWACR gene loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homologs of chromosome 15 proved to be biparental in origin while the two SMCs appeared maternal </plain></SENT>
