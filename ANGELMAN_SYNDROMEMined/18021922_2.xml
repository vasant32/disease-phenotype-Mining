<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (9 females, 9 males), aged 4.0-24.3 years (mean age, 10.1 years), and two control groups consisting of 18 epileptic and 24 healthy patients, underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (L(1)-L(4)), and z score was evaluated for each patient; the t score was considered for patients aged &gt; or = 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010119'>Abnormal bone mineral density</z:mp> was present in 8/18 (44.5%) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, in 7/18 (38.9%) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> group, and in none of the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a significant difference regarding mean age of patients (6 versus 15 years, P = 0.008, by Fisher exact test), and mean length of drug treatment (3.5 versus 11.1 years, P = 0.005 by Fisher exact test), appeared in the group with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients (94.4%) were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs, mainly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi>, for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000938'>osteopenia</z:hpo> in almost half the children and young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
