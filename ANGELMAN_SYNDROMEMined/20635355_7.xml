<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBE3A is subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in neurons in most regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of UBE3A from the maternal chromosome is essential to prevent AS, because the paternally inherited gene is not expressed, probably mediated by antisense UBE3A <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that increasing methylation might reduce expression of the antisense UBE3A <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, thereby increasing UBE3A expression from the paternal gene and ameliorating the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a trial using two dietary supplements, betaine and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> to promote global levels of methylation and attempt to activate the paternally inherited UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a number of investigations at regular intervals including general clinical and developmental evaluations, biochemical determinations on blood and urine, and electroencephalographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report herein the data on 48 children with AS who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled protocol using betaine and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant changes between treated and untreated children; however, in a small subset of patients we observed some positive trends </plain></SENT>
