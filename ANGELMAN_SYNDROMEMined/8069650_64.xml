<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic investigation showed that four patients carried one and a fifth patient had two extra chromosomes derived from number 15 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization with a chromosome 15 library and a centromere 15 probe confirmed that the entire inv dup chromosomes were derived from chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis using probes mapping in the region deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> patients implied that in at least two patients the extra chromosomes were asymmetric with one copy of the PWS region on the extra marker chromosome but two copies of the region centromeric to the PWS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three other cases had an inv dup(15) with two extra copies of the PWS region, but in one of these, heteromorphisms clearly demonstrated that the two centromeres derived from two different chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inv dup(15) presumably resulted from an illegitimate recombination event between two different chromosomes 15 in most or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed a maternal origin of the duplicated chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical severity appears to be associated with dosage of the PWS/AS region rather than with differences in the extent of the duplicated segment </plain></SENT>
