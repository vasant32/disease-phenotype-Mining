<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are neurobehavioral disorders resulting from deficiency of imprinted gene expression from paternal or maternal chromosome 15q11-15q13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans, expression of the imprinted genes is under control of a bipartite cis-acting imprinting center (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Families with deletions causing PWS imprinting defects localize the PWS-IC to 4.3 kb overlapping with SNRPN exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Families with deletions causing AS imprinting defects localize the AS-IC to 880 bp 35 kb upstream of the PWS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report two mouse mutations resulting in defects similar to that seen in AS patients with deletion of the AS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An insertion/duplication mutation 13 kb upstream of Snrpn exon 1 resulted in lack of methylation at the maternal Snrpn promoter, activation of maternally repressed genes, and decreased expression of paternally repressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The acquisition of a paternal epigenotype on the maternal chromosome in the mutant mice was demonstrated by the ability to rescue the <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> in a mouse model of a PWS imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A second mutation, an 80-kb deletion extending upstream of the first mutation, caused a similar imprinting defect with variable penetrance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there is a mouse functional equivalent to the human AS-IC </plain></SENT>
