<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome (AS)</z:e> deletion and 12q duplication in a child with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Traditional cytogenetic studies showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 46,XY karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probe D15S10 (AS region/15q11.2) revealed a deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we serendipitously detected 12q24.3 duplication by FISH with 12q subtelomere probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He inherited this duplication from the mother who presented with a balanced translocation karyotype 46,XX,add(12)(q24.3).ish t(12;13)(q24.3;p11.2)(12qtel-;12qtel+,D13Z1/D21Z1+,RB1+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) revealed a duplication of three <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (RP11-46H11, RP11-386I8, and RP11-309H3) covering about 423 Kb of DNA sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The published 12q terminal duplication cases had a detectable segment by classical banded cytogenetics techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the smallest 12q cryptic rearrangement characterized by array-CGH and confirmed by BAC-clone FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we attempted to separate the clinical features associated with AS deletion and those features that are probably due to partial 12q duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We then reviewed the genes mapped in the duplicated region using the human genome database to understand the clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A subsequent pregnancy in the mother revealed an apparently balanced t(12;13) karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We compare our case with the published cases, and discuss the implications of our findings and its relevance in addressing genetic counseling issues </plain></SENT>
