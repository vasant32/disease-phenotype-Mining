<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These anomalies usually occur de novo with a very low recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in rare cases, familial translocations are observed, giving rise to a high recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on the difficulties of genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in a family segregating for a translocation (14;15)(q11;q13) where two consanguineous parents carry the same familial translocation in this chromosome 15 imprinting region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both children of the couple inherited a chromosomal anomaly leading to PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a paternal 15q11-q13 deletion was responsible for PWS in the first child, whereas prenatal diagnosis demonstrated that PWS was associated with a maternal 15q11-q13 UPD in the fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report demonstrates that both conventional and molecular cytogenetic parental analyses have to be performed when a deletion is responsible for PWS or AS in order not to overlook a familial translocation and to insure reliable diagnosis and genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
