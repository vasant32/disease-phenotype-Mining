<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The loss of expression can be due to parent-specific segmental deletions or can arise from non-deletional mechanisms, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of chromosome 15 or defects in imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most current diagnostic methods to distinguish PWS from AS require separate amplification and detection steps, and some methods cannot differentiate between deletional and non-deletional forms of these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a single-step, methylation-specific PCR, and quantitative melting curve analysis assay to identify methylation differences and copy number changes in PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this strategy, duplex amplification followed by melting curve analysis was performed to detect the maternally and paternally imprinted SNRPN alleles and LIS1 reference gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To discriminate between deletional and non-deletional PWS and AS, relative peak height ratios of maternal or paternal SNRPN:LIS1 were determined, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To validate the diagnostic accuracy of the analysis, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PWS and AS samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete concordance between the melting curve analysis and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification results was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PWS and AS samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific PCR and quantitative melting curve analysis represents a simple, rapid, and robust alternative to methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for the detection of and discrimination between deletional and non-deletional forms of PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
