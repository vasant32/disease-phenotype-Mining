<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The primary phenotypes are attributable to loss of expression of imprinted genes within this region which can arise by means of a number of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive single approach to diagnosing both PWS and AS is to study methylation patterns within 15q11-q13; however many techniques exist for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the diversity of techniques available, there is a need for consensus testing and reporting guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Testing and reporting guidelines have been drawn up and agreed in accordance with the procedures of the UK Clinical Molecular Genetics Society and the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A practical set of molecular genetic testing and reporting guidelines has been developed for these two disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, advice is given on appropriate reporting policies, including advice on test sensitivity and recurrence risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In considering test sensitivity, the possibility of differential diagnoses is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An agreed set of practice guidelines has been developed for the diagnostic molecular genetic testing of PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
