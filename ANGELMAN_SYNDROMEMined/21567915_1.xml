<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were exposed to three experimentally manipulated conditions: proximity only, restricted social interaction, and social interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Children smiled the most in the social interaction condition and the least in the proximity only condition confirming the effect of social interaction on these behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a decline in smiling and laughing in the oldest group (13.4-15.9 years) only in the social interaction condition </plain></SENT>
