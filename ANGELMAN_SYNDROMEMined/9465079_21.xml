<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> are neurogenetic disorders caused by the lack of a paternal or a maternal contribution from human chromosome 15q11-q13, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions in the transcription unit of the imprinted SNRPN gene have been found in patients who have PWS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> because of a parental imprint switch failure in this chromosomal domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the SNRPN exon 1 region, which is deleted in the PWS patients, contains an imprint switch element from which the maternal and paternal epigenotypes of the 15q11-q13 domain originate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the model organism Drosophila, we show here that a fragment from this region can function as a silencer in transgenic flies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repression was detected specifically from this element and could not be observed with control human sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments allowed the delineation of the silencer to a fragment of 215 bp containing the SNRPN promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide an additional link between <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and an evolutionary conserved silencing mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the identified element participates in the long range regulation of the imprinted 15q11-q13 domain or locally represses SNRPN expression from the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
