<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of the paternal or the maternal alleles by deletion of the region or by <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> 15 results in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, the two phenotypically distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> are caused by the lack of products of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsets of PWS and AS patients exhibit 'imprinting mutations', such as small microdeletions within the 5' region of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N ( SNRPN ) transcription unit which affect the transcriptional activity and methylation status of distant imprinted genes throughout 15q11-q13 in cis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of these long-range effects, we have analyzed the chromatin structure of the 150 kb SNRPN transcription unit for DNase I- and Msp I-hypersensitive sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using an in vivo approach on lymphoblastoid cell lines from PWS and AS individuals, we discovered that the SNRPN exon 1 is flanked by prominent hypersensitive sites on the paternal allele, but is completely inaccessible to nucleases on the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, we identified several regions of increased nuclease hypersensitivity on the maternal allele, one of which coincides with the AS minimal microdeletion region and another lies in intron 1 immediately downstream of the paternal-specific hypersensitive sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At several sites, parental origin-specific nuclease hypersensitivity was found to be correlated with hypermethylation on the allele contributed by the other parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differential parental origin-dependent chromatin conformations might govern access of regulatory protein complexes and/or <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> which could mediate interaction of the region with other genes </plain></SENT>
