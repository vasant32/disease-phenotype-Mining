<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical suspicion of AS was raised at the age of 15 months when she presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014553" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="JAE">epilepsy, absence</z:e> of speech, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>jerky movements</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and paroxysmal episodes of laughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, she had facial dysmorphic features such as microbrachycephaly, mid-facial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>macrostomia</z:hpo> and prominent mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">Dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphism (DNRP) analysis, identified absence of maternal alleles at D15S543, D15S113 and GABRB3 loci, findings consistent with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies on CYP19 locus (outside the 15q11-13 region) revealed the presence of two different alleles, thus excluding the possibility of paternal isodisomy of chromosome 15 in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Breast development at the age of 4.5 years, accompanied by accelerated growth velocity and bone age suggested the diagnosis of variant thelarche </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the second case of AS with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034013,C0032939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sexual precocity</z:e> reported and whether this combination is a coincidence or not remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
