<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetic diagnosis is currently performed using a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), DNA polymorphism analysis, and DNA methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only methylation analysis will detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three categories of PWS abnormalities, but its reliability in tissues other than peripheral blood has not been examined extensively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the methylation status at the CpG island of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN) gene and at the PW71 locus using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal lymphoblast (LB) cell lines (n = 48), amniotic fluid (AF) cell cultures (n = 25), cultured chorionic villus samples (CVS, n = 17), and fetal tissues (n = 18) by Southern blot analysis with methylation sensitive enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these samples, 20 LB cell lines, three AF cultures, one CVS, and 15 fetal tissues had been previously diagnosed as having deletions or UPD by other molecular methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methylation status at SNRPN showed consistent results when compared with FISH or DNA polymorphism analysis using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the methylation pattern for PW71 was inconsistent when compared with other tests and should therefore not be used on tissues other than peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that SNRPN, but not PW71, methylation analysis may be useful for diagnosis of PWS/AS on LB cell lines, cultured amniotic fluid, or chorionic villus samples and will allow, for the first time, prenatal diagnosis for families known to carry imprinting centre defects </plain></SENT>
