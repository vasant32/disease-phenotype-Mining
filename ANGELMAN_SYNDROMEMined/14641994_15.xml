<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to develop conditions for denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) analysis of UBE3A and to compare the sensitivity to direct genomic sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was obtained from 17 Angelman patients with known mutations and from 120 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA was amplified for the 10 coding exons and 6 upstream noncoding exons of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using dHPLC, the mutations previously identified in 17 Angelman patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> easily detected using a single dHPLC condition for most exon-containing fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 exons in 120 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls identified 15 other DNA alterations of varying frequency, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which are assumed to be benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that dHPLC is a reliable and convenient method for detecting mutations in UBE3A causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No disease-causing mutations were found in the noncoding exons </plain></SENT>
