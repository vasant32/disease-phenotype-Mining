<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its incidence is estimated as one in every 20,000 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of discoveries made in molecular biology, patients can be classified as belonging to five types: deletion, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), imprinting defects, mutation of the UBE3A ubiquitin protein ligase gene and unidentified mechanism (15% 20% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some studies report significant correlations between the phenotype and the genetic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed, retrospectively, 37 patients suffering from AS with a positive genetic study and who had been controlled for at least two years in the Neurological Service at the Hospital Sant Joan de D u </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data was collected on physical characteristics, behavioural phenotype, type of communication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> and the medication they needed, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, start age, types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, medication, schooling and social integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 87% of cases were due to de novo deletion, 8% were caused by UPD, and 5% had their origins in imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average age of diagnosis was 6.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> present in 48% of the patients required medication in 67% of cases, and 95% presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were myoclonic, tonic clonic and atonic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The electroencephalogram (EEG) was the characteristic found in the AS in 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most effective treatment was afforded by valproate and clonazepam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As regards the phenotype, no differences were found according to the genetic alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most effective treatment for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> was <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was an almost constant finding in our series, as was cognitive affectation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Lastly, it must be pointed out that educational and socio occupational integration is difficult for patients suffering from AS </plain></SENT>
