<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants were five children, 2-11 years-of-age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parents maintained sleep diaries to record sleep and disruptive nighttime behaviors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actigraphy was added to provide independent evaluations of sleep-wake activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment package targeted the sleep environment, the sleep-wake schedule, and parent-child interactions during sleep times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment was introduced sequentially, across families, and evaluated in an interrupted time series, multiple baseline design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data show that prior to treatment, baseline rates of nighttime disruptive behavior were stable or increasing and none of the participants were falling to sleep independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the introduction of treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants quickly learned to initiate sleep independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gradual reductions were reported in disruptive behaviors and these improvements were sustained over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results were replicated with two participants when treatment was withdrawn and reinstated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes in disruptive bedtime behaviors and in sleep <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were found to be statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Parents indicated high satisfaction with the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A behavioral treatment package was found to be effective with five children with long histories of significant sleep-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260653" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that behavioral treatment may be a reasonable way to address <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> in some children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
