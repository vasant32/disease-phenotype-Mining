<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> has seldom been made in infancy because the typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>craniofacial dysmorphism</z:hpo> and the typical outbursts of unprovoked laughter are not fully developed before the second and third year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other features such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> or absence of language, though invariably present, are less obvious in the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe three children in whom consecutive electroencephalographic (EEG) studies show very large amplitude slow activity at 2-3/s, often rhythmic, usually occurring in prolonged runs and often more prominent posteriorly, sometimes with spikes or sharp-wave activity, and invariably associated with a diffuse rhythmic activity at 4-6/ s of 200 microvolts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes were present as early as six months of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They preceded development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and occurred much earlier than the craniofacial dysmorphology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that methodical use of EEG in the elucidation of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorder</z:e> and knowledge of the characteristic EEG picture may help to identify patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> at an early age and before the clinical features become obvious </plain></SENT>
