<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MECP2 encodes <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-CpG-binding protein 2 that acts as a transcriptional repressor for methylated gene constructs but is surprisingly not required for maintaining imprinted gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we test the hypothesis that MECP2 deficiency may affect the level of expression of UBE3A and neighboring <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> candidate gene GABRB3 without necessarily affecting imprinted expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple quantitative methods were used including automated quantitation of immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization by laser scanning cytometry on tissue microarrays, immunoblot and TaqMan PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated significant defects in UBE3A/E6AP expression in two different Mecp2 deficient mouse strains and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e>, Angelman and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> brains compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although no difference was observed in the allelic expression of several imprinted transcripts in Mecp2-null brain, Ube3a sense expression was significantly reduced, consistent with the decrease in protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A non-imprinted gene from 15q11-q13, GABRB3, encoding the beta3 subunit of the GABAA receptor, also showed significantly reduced expression in multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e>, Angelman and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> brain samples, and Mecp2 deficient mice by quantitative immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest an overlapping pathway of gene dysregulation within 15q11-q13 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e>, Angelman and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and implicate MeCP2 in the regulation of UBE3A and GABRB3 expressions in the postnatal mammalian brain </plain></SENT>
