<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 50% of first-trimester <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">miscarriages</z:e> result from fetal chromosome abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, G-banded chromosome analysis is used to determine if large-scale genetic imbalances are the cause of these pregnancy losses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique relies on the culture of cells derived from the fetus, a technique that has many limitations, including a high rate of culture failure, maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of fetal cells, and poor chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)-array analysis is a powerful new molecular cytogenetic technique that allows genomewide analysis of DNA copy number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By hybridizing patient DNA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference DNA to arrays of genomic clones, unbalanced gains or losses of genetic material across the genome can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, 41 product-of-conception (POC) samples, which were previously analyzed by G-banding, were tested using CGH arrays to determine not only if the array could identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported abnormalities, but also whether any previously undetected genomic imbalances would be discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The array methodology detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> abnormalities as reported by G-banding analysis and revealed new abnormalities in 4/41 (9.8%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of those, one <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 POC was also mosaic for <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 20, one had a duplication of the 10q telomere region, one had an interstitial deletion of chromosome 9p, and the fourth had an interstitial duplication of the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region on chromosome 15q, which, if maternally inherited, has been implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study demonstrates that the DNA-based CGH-array technology overcomes many of the limitations of routine cytogenetic analysis of POC samples while enhancing the detection of fetal chromosome aberrations </plain></SENT>
