<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular events that limit excitatory synapse development so that synapses form at the right time and place and in the correct numbers are less well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a RhoA <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factor, Ephexin5, which negatively regulates excitatory synapse development until EphrinB binding to the EphB receptor tyrosine kinase triggers Ephexin5 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degradation of Ephexin5 promotes EphB-dependent excitatory synapse development and is mediated by Ube3A, a ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and duplicated in some forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>Autism Spectrum Disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASDs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that aberrant EphB/Ephexin5 signaling during the development of synapses may contribute to the abnormal cognitive function that occurs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and, possibly, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
