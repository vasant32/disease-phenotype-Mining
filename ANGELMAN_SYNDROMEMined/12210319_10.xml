<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It affects mostly females, and one possible pathogenic mechanism was considered to involve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was based on the finding of ultrastructural alterations in the mitochondria and decreased respiratory chain enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the principal etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> has since been found to be mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is located on the X chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis has allowed the phenotype of MECP2 mutations to be broadened beyond <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> to include girls who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, and an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> phenotype, as well as males with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present a girl with a previously described mutation in the MECP2 gene whose phenotype is of atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> in infancy without a clear period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As part of her evaluation for <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, a muscle biopsy and respiratory chain enzyme analysis showed a slight decrease in respiratory chain enzyme activity consistent with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report supports broadening the phenotype of patients who should be considered for MECP2 mutation analysis to include cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> without evidence of an initial period of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it supports the hypothesis of an underlying secondary defect in energy metabolism contributing to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
