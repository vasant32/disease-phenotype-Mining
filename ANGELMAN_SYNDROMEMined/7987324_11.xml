<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, the AS critical region has been defined by an inherited deletion of approximately 1.5Mb, spanning the 3-21 (D15S10), LS6-1 (D15S113) and GABRB3 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified an individual with the typical features of AS who has a deletion of the maternal chromosome which encompasses LS6-1, but does not extend to either flanking marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This deletion, initially detected by (CA)n repeat analysis, was further characterised by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using cosmids derived from a 260 kb LS6-1 yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither end cosmid from this YAC clone <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> within the deletion, suggesting that the minimal AS region is less than 200 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied three loci within 15q11-13 which detect parent-of-origin specific DNA methylation imprints, and found that both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maternal and paternal patterns were present in this patient </plain></SENT>
