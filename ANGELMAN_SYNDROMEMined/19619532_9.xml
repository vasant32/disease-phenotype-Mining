<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work we have focused on NHE6Delta255-256, the protein product of a specific 6-bp patient deletion in SLC9A6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To resolve the molecular mechanism causing the cellular dysfunction associated with this mutant, we have characterized its intracellular behaviour in comparison to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> NHE6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that NHE6Delta255-256 is much less stable than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> NHE6 is transported to the plasma membrane and early endosomes and remains stable, NHE6Delta255-256 is degraded via two independent pathways mediated by proteasomes and lysosomes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of NHE6 had no detectable effect on endosomal pH, but co-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of NHE6 and the closely related NHE9 caused enhanced acidification of early endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that NHE6 participates in regulation of endosomal pH and provides a cellular basis for understanding the loss of NHE6 function leading to a neurological phenotype resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
