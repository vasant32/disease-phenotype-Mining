<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are associated with distinct phenotypes that include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both PWS and AS are caused by loss of function of genes located in chromosome 15q11-q13, an area subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR), based on parent of origin specific DNA methylation at the promoter region of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N gene (SNRPN), can provide accurate and rapid diagnosis for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PWS patients while it is less accurate for AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the development of a referral system for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS based on M-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pediatric geneticists, psychiatrists, or neurologists were asked to evaluate phenotypes of patients with PWS or AS and complete a questionnaire designed according to the consensus criteria to diagnose these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis based on M-PCR was performed for patients with a score of at least two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with suspected PWS and 20 patients with suspected AS were referred for diagnostic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PWS was diagnosed in 26 of these patients and AS in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the major diagnostic criteria for PWS, excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> were more prevalent in older patients (&gt; or = 1 yr) than in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> were significantly more prevalent in older PWS patients than in non-PWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: M-PCR is a cost-effective method for the diagnosis of PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The limitations of current scoring systems and the low cost of M-PCR suggest that routine molecular screening is justified for patients suspected of having PWS </plain></SENT>
