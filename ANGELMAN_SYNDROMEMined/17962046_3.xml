<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is thought to be one of the few <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> with GABAergic-related genetic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AS results from a functional deficit of the imprinted UBE3A gene, located at 15q11-q13, resulting mainly from a 4-Mb deletion that includes <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor subunit genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These genes are believed to affect the GABAergic system and modulate the clinical severity of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To understand the underlying cortical dysfunction, we have investigated the primary somatosensory-evoked responses in AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects included eleven AS patients with a 15q11-q13 deletion (AS Del), two AS patients without a 15q11-q13 deletion, but with a UBE3A mutation (AS non-Del), six <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> patients (non-AS) and eleven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory-evoked fields (SEFs) in response to median nerve stimulation were measured by magnetoencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The N1m peak latency in AS Del patients was significantly longer (34.6+/-4.8 ms) than in non-AS patients (19.5+/-1.2 ms, P&lt;0.001) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (18.4+/-1.8 ms, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The next component, P1m, was prolonged and ambiguous and was only detected in patients taking clonazepam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SEF waveforms of AS non-Del patients were similar to those of control individuals, rather than to AS Del patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, GABAergic dysfunction in AS Del patients is likely due to hemizygosity of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor subunit genes, suggesting that GABAergic inhibition plays an important role in synchronous activity of human sensory systems </plain></SENT>
