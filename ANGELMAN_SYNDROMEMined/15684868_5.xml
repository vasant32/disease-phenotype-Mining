<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Imprinting abnormalities account for up to 4% of patients with Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deletions of the imprinting center region are the molecular abnormality observed in a subset of Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome cases with imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing of imprinting center deletions in patients with Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome is not readily available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such testing is important for the diagnostics of Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome because it allows for more accurate diagnosis and recurrence risk prediction in families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the development, validation, and implementation of a real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay for imprinting center deletion detection in patients with Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome, which we have incorporated into our genetic testing strategy for these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date we have tested, on a clinical basis, five patients with either Angelman or Prader-Willi syndrome in whom an imprinting center defect was implicated and found a deletion in one patient that was determined to be familial </plain></SENT>
