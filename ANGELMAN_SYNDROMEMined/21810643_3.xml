<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Identifying genes that contribute to variation in cortical thickness provides a means to elucidate some of the biological mechanisms underlying these diseases and general cognitive abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify common genetic variants that affect cortical thickness in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>, and controls and to test these variants for association with cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 597 198 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for association with average cortical thickness in a genome-wide association study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms were tested for their effect on several measures of cognitive performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Four major hospitals in Oslo, Norway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1054 case individuals and controls were analyzed in the genome-wide association study and follow-up cognitive study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genome-wide association study included controls (n = 181) and individuals with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV -diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> spectrum disorder (n = 94), bipolar spectrum disorder (n = 97), and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0525045" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">affective disorders</z:e> (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical thickness measured with magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive performance as assessed by several neuropsychological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two closely linked genetic variants (rs4906844 and rs11633924) within the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region on chromosome 15q12 showed a genome-wide significant association (P = 1.1 x 10(-8) with average cortical thickness and modest association with cognitive performance (permuted P = .03) specifically among patients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This genome-wide association study identifies a common genetic variant that contributes to the heritable reduction of cortical thickness in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the usefulness of cortical thickness as an intermediate phenotype for neuropsychiatric diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future independent replication studies are required to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
