<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were initially referred for HR-CGH analysis and MRS-MLPA was performed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRS-MLPA analysis revealed imbalances in 15/258 patients (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten deletions were identified, including deletions of 1p36, 5q35 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e>), 7q11 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams-Beuren syndrome</z:e>), 17p11 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Smith-Magenis syndrome</z:e>), 15q11 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>) and 22q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duplications were detected in 5q35, 7q11, 17p13, 17p11 and 22q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We reviewed another 170 patients referred specifically for MRS-MLPA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty of these patients were referred with a clinical suspicion of a specific syndrome, which was confirmed in 17 patients (21.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 90 patients were referred because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and dysmorphism but without suspicion of a specific syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven imbalances, including four duplications, were detected in these 90 patients (7.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical data regarding three patients investigated by MRS-MLPA are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The imbalances carried by these patients include a small interstitial 1p36 deletion, a small duplication of 5q35 (encompassing the NSD1 gene, which is deleted/mutated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175695" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Sotos syndrome</z:e>) and a duplication of 7q11 (reciprocal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams-Beuren syndrome</z:e> deletion), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRS-MLPA allows testing for a number of micro-deletions/-duplications in a single experiment, thereby filling a gap between array techniques and single locus techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>MRS-MLPA combined with Subtelomeric MLPA represents an attractive first test in a clinical algorithm for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
