<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These deletions are exclusively of maternal origin in AS but of paternal origin in PWS indicating that the 15q11-q13 region is subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transmission of a submicroscopic deletion in one three generation family resulted in AS only upon maternal transmission of the deletion with no clinical phenotype associated with paternal transmission (1,2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The breakpoint of this submicroscopic deletion has been cloned and sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first deletion junction from the AS/PWS region which has been so characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequence of the deletion junction revealed a 19 bp insertion of unknown origin with no evidence of repetitive elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A probe from the proximal deletion breakpoint, PB11, lies within the currently defined minimum region of deletion overlap in PWS, which contains the SNRPN and D15S63 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the imprinted gene(s) responsible for the PWS phenotype are proximal of pB11 in this deletion overlap region </plain></SENT>
