<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The transcript from this gene is missing or altered in six independent mutant alleles of the p locus, suggesting that disruption of this gene results in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> phenotype that defines mutant p alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the human homolog revealed that it is localized to human chromosome 15 at q11.2-q12, a region associated with Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, suggesting that altered expression of this gene may be responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> phenotype exhibited by certain individuals with these disorders </plain></SENT>
