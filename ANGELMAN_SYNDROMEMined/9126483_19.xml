<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) type-A receptor subunits beta 3 (GABRB3), alpha 5 (GABRA5), and gamma 3 (GABRG3) map to chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three genes are contained within roughly 800 kb of the distal part of the imprinted Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 570-kb contig encompassing GABRB3 and GABRA5 has been constructed in P1, lambda phage, and PAC clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GABRB3 spans 250 kb of DNA and is organized into 9 exons that range from 68 to 504 bp, while GABRA5 is encoded by 11 exons (65 to 924 bp in length) within 86 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The exon/intron borders for both genes have been characterized and, primers have been designed to amplify each of the individual exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two reference STR markers have been positioned in the contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reference STR for GABRB3 is in fact located at least 60 kb beyond the 3' terminus of GABRB3, while D15S97 is contained within intron 4 of GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detailed physical map of this GABAA receptor subunit gene cluster should not only be useful in genetic studies of the 15q11-q13 region, but will also be important for investigating the evolution and expression of the GABAA receptor gene superfamily </plain></SENT>
