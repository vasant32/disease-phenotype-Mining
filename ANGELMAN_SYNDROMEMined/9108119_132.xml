<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The beta3 subunit is an essential component of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A)-R in many brain regions, especially during development, and is implicated in several pathophysiologic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined mice harboring a beta3 gene inactivated by gene targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A)-R density is approximately halved in brain of beta3-deficient mice, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A)-R function is severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most beta3-deficient mice die as neonates; some neonatal mortality, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, is accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>beta3-deficient mice that survive are <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runted</z:mp> until weaning but achieve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body size by adulthood, although with <z:mp ids='MP_0002083'>reduced life span</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These mice are fertile but mothers fail to nurture offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is grossly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but a number of behaviors are abnormal, consistent with the widespread location of the beta3 subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mice are very <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001400'>hyperresponsive</z:mp> to human contact and other sensory stimuli, and often run continuously in tight circles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When held by the tail, they hold <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> paws in like a ball, which is frequently a sign of neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They have difficulty swimming, walking on grids, and fall off platforms and rotarods, although they do not have a jerky gait </plain></SENT>
