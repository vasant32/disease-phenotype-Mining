<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although MECP2 is ubiquitously transcribed, MeCP2 expression is developmentally regulated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in neuronal subpopulations, defined as MeCP2(lo) and MeCP2(hi) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that pathways affecting MeCP2 expression changes may be defective in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> without MECP2 mutations, a high-throughput quantitation of MeCP2 expression was performed on a tissue microarray containing frontal cortex samples from 28 different patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> and age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined quantitative analyses of MeCP2 protein and alternatively polyadenylated transcript levels were performed by laser scanning cytometry and tested for significant differences from age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> cerebral samples showed an increase in total MeCP2 expression and the percentage of MeCP2(hi) cells with age that could be explained by increased MECP2 transcription within the MeCP2(hi) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in the relative usage of the long transcript in the MeCP2(lo) population was observed in postnatal compared to fetal brain, but alternate polyadenylation did not correlate with MeCP2 expression changes at the single cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain samples from several related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>pervasive developmental disorder</z:hpo>, Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> showed significant differences in MeCP2 expression from age-matched controls by apparently different transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that multiple pathways regulate the complex developmental expression of MeCP2 and are defective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism-spectrum disorders</z:hpo> in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
