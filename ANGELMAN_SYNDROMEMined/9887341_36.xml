<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS is caused by maternal deletions for chromosome 15q11-q13, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), imprinting defects or loss-of-function mutations in the UBE3A locus which encodes E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The UBE3A gene is imprinted with paternal silencing in human brain and similar silencing of the Ube3a locus in Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced the major coding exons for UBE3A in 56 index patients with a clinical diagnosis of AS and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA methylation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis identified disease-causing mutations in 17 of 56 patients (30%) including 13 truncating mutations, two missense mutations, one single amino acid deletion and one stop codon mutation predicting an elongated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations were identified in six of eight families (75%) with more than one affected case, and in 11 of 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> (23%); no mutation was found in one family with two siblings, one with a typical and one with an atypical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations were de novo in nine of the 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>isolated cases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An amino acid polymorphism of threonine substituted for alanine at codon 178 was identified, and a 3 bp length polymorphism was found in the intron upstream of exon 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> informative cases, phenotypic expression was consistent with imprinting with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> when a mutation was on the paternal chromosome and an AS phenotype when a mutation was on the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Laboratory diagnosis and genetic counseling for AS are complex, and mutation analysis is valuable in clinically typical AS patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
