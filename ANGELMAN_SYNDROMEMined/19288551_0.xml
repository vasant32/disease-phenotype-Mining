<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We document a sib pair born to a mother with a reciprocal translocation, t(15;22)(q13;q11.2): the daughter had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> phenotype associated with a maternally derived 15q deletion, and the son had a phenotype associated with a 22q deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adjacent two-type segregation during gametogenesis in the mother can account for the unbalanced karyotypes of the siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a tetravalent chromatid formed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 15, derivative chromosome 15, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 22, and derivative chromosome 22, the daughter inherited chromosome 22 and derivative chromosome 22 and the son inherited chromosome 15 and derivative chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The family is unique in that two distinctive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e>, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, occurred within the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The family is also elucidative from an educational standpoint in that major concepts of non-Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> (microdeletion, <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, and reciprocal translocation) need to be considered to appreciate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the family illustrates the importance of cryptic rearrangements at the most proximal end of acrocentric chromosomes in the evaluation of siblings with multiple congenital anomaly-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> phenotypes that are dissimilar among affected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The situation is analogous to parental balanced translocation between the most "distal" segments of a chromosome, that is, the subtelomere region, a recently appreciated cause of familial recurrence of multiple congenital anomaly-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> phenotype with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G-banding karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that cryptic rearrangements at the most proximal end, analogous to those at the most distal end, should be considered as an appreciable cause of recurrent multiple congenital anomaly-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> phenotype </plain></SENT>
