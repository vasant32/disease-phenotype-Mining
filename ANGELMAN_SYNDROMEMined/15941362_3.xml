<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are, however, few researchers who have examined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal in this study was to better characterize the sleep patterns and problems in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parents of 339 individuals between the ages of 3 and 22 completed a previously validated sleep questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results confirmed that a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0700201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sleep problems</z:e> exist in a significant portion of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, most prominently in the areas of sleep initiation, sleep duration, reliance on sleep facilitators, being awakened by loud noises, and being disoriented when aroused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Developmental trends, syndrome specificity of findings, clinical implications, and directions for future research are discussed </plain></SENT>
