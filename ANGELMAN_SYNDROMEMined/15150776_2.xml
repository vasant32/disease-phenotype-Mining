<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations have been found in the UBE3A gene (E6-AP ubiquitin protein ligase gene) in many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> patients with no deletion, no <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, and no imprinting defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBE3A mutations are more frequent in familial than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients and the mutations described so far seem to cause similar phenotypes in the familial affected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two first cousins who have inherited the same UBE3A frameshift mutation (duplication of GAGG in exon 10) from their asymptomatic mothers but present discordant phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband shows typical AS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her affected cousin shows a more severe phenotype, with asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> that led originally to a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proband's brain MRI shows mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> while her cousin's brain MRI shows severe brain malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This family demonstrates that, although brain malformation is unusual in AS, presence of a brain malformation does not exclude the diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, this UBE3A mutation was transmitted from the cousin's grandfather to only two sisters among eight full siblings, raising the hypothesis of mosaicism for this mutation </plain></SENT>
