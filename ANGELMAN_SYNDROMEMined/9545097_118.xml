<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former view that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> was rooted in exposure to humorless and perfectionistic parenting has given way to the notion that genetic influences are dominant underlying factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Still, identification of specific heritable factors has been slow with causes identified in only a few cases in unselected series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A broad search for genetic and environmental influences that cause or predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> is the major thrust of the South Carolina <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the first 100 cases enrolled in the project, abnormalities of chromosome 15 have emerged as the single most common cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four abnormalities identified include deletions and duplications of proximal 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other chromosome aberrations seen in single cases include a balanced 13;16 translocation, a pericentric inversion 12, a deletion of 20p, and a ring 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Candidate genes involved in the 15q region affected by duplication and deletion include the ubiquitin-protein ligase (UBE3A) gene responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and genes for three <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the deletions or duplications occurred on the chromosome inherited from the mother </plain></SENT>
