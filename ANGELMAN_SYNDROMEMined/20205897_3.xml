<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: We will discuss the clinical and genetic diagnosis of a child with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor delay</z:hpo>, who at 3 years of age presented with paroxysms of <z:mp ids='MP_0010946'>hyperpnea</z:mp>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> unrelated to breathing anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The child underwent genetic (karyotype, FISH telomeres) and neuroradiological (cranial CT and MRI) tests, which proved to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He came under our clinical observation at 3 years and 5 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor delay</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphisms</z:hpo> we completed the genetic investigations based on his clinical feature and analysis of the available literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> associated with anomalous breathing pattern may suggest the Joubert and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e>, however these were excluded on the basis of clinical and genetic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, suspected for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphisms</z:hpo> and absent language, was also excluded because of the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of methylation at SNRPN locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another possible diagnosis was the Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PHS), characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, breathing anomalies (paroxisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0010946'>hyperpnea</z:mp>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>), dysmorphisms and sometimes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of TCF4 gene located at 18q21.2 region has been recently identified as causative of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our patient the research of TCF4 mutation by the Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Erlangen (Germany), showed a de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, an underdiagnosed cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, was based on clinical and genetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Searching for TCF4 mutations is highly recommended when others overlapping syndromes was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At our knowledge our patient is the first italian case of PHS diagnosed at molecular level </plain></SENT>
