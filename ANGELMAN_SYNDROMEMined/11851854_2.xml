<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven individuals participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A within-group analysis revealed that those with DS performed better on tacting or labelling and echoing than on manding or requesting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other effects were found, apart from an absence of echoing in those with AS, a result that is hardly surprising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A between-groups analysis revealed no differences between the aetiological groups in terms of their use of mands or requests and tacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individuals with DS and PDD did not differ in their scores on echoic functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings for the study of behavioural phenotypes and for communication intervention are discussed </plain></SENT>
