<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PWS-IC operates in cis to activate transcription of genes that are expressed exclusively from the paternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have created a conditional allele of the PWS-IC to investigate its developmental activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the paternal PWS-IC in the embryo before implantation abolishes expression of the paternal-only genes in the neonatal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, deletion of the PWS-IC in early brain progenitors does not affect the subsequent imprinted status of PWS/AS genes in the newborn brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the PWS-IC functions to protect the paternal epigenotype at the epiblast stage of development but is dispensable thereafter </plain></SENT>
