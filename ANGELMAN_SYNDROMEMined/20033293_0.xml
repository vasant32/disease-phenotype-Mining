<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Uniparental isodisomy arises when an individual inherits two copies of a specific chromosome from a single parent, which can unmask a recessive mutation or cause a problem of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genetic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe an exceptional case in which the patient simultaneously presents <z:hpo ids='HP_0003231'>tyrosinemia</z:hpo> type 1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The genetic studies showed that the patient presents paternal uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 15, with absence of the maternal homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of this isodisomy, the patient is homozygous for the mutation IVS12+5G&gt;A in the FAH gene, located in the chromosomal region 15q23-25, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003231'>tyrosinemia</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation was inherited from his father in double dosage, whereas the mother is not a carrier, which implies that the recurrence risk in the family is negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the lack of maternal contribution causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> associated with a loss of maternal gene expression in chromosome region 15q11-q13, and more specifically, of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This gene shows a tissue-specific imprinting, and only the maternally derived allele is expressed in certain areas of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed through a literature review that <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> probably occurs more frequently than suspected, although it is more usually detected when the <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> implies the appearance of a disease because of the gene imprinting or by reduction to homozygosity of a recessive mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conclusion is that <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> should always be considered when more than one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> mapping to the same chromosome is present in a patient </plain></SENT>
