<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This region is subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> and characterized by complex combinations of low copy repeat elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> are caused primarily by 15q11-13 deletions of paternal and maternal origin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>Autism</z:hpo> is seen with maternal, but not paternal, interstitial duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isodicentric 15q, most often of maternal origin, is associated with a complex phenotype often including autistic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Limitations of conventional cytogenetic tests preclude a detailed analysis in most patients with 15q rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have developed a microarray for comparative genomic hybridization utilizing 106 genomic clones from chromosome 15q to characterize this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The array accurately localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> breakpoints associated with gains or losses on 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results confirmed the location of the common breakpoints associated with interstitial deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of idic(15q) chromosomes are comprised of symmetrical arms with four copies of the breakpoint 1 to breakpoint 5 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with less common breakpoints that are not distinguished by routine cytogenetic methods were more accurately characterized by array analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This microarray provides a detailed characterization for chromosomal abnormalities involving 15q11-q14 and is useful for more precise genotype-phenotype correlations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, PWS, AS, and idic(15) syndrome </plain></SENT>
