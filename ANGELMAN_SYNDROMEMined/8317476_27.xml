<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These mutations therefore behave neither as dominant nor as recessive mutations but, rather, show an imprinted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed two sibling pairs with AS and a larger family with four AS offspring of three sisters with several recently described microsatellite polymorphisms in the AS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AS siblings inherited the same maternal alleles at the GABRB3 and GABRA5 loci, and the unaffected siblings of AS individuals inherited the other maternal alleles at these loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of the AS sibling pairs, analysis of a recombination event indicates that the mutation responsible for AS is distal to locus D15S63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with a previously described imprinted submicroscopic deletion causing AS, a deletion that includes loci D15S10, D15S113, and GABRB3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> distal to D15S63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the larger AS family provides the first clear demonstration of a new mutation in nondeletion AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of linkage of AS to GABRB3 in these three families, on the assumption of imprinted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> (i.e., penetrance of an AS mutation is 1 if transmitted maternally and is 0 if transmitted paternally), indicates a maximum lod score of 3.52 at theta = 0 </plain></SENT>
