<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have cloned the mouse p gene cDNA and the cDNA of its human counterpart, P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The region of mouse chromosome 7 containing the p locus is syntenic with human chromosome 15q11-q13, a region associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, both of which involve profound imprinting effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PWS patients lack sequences of paternal origin from 15q, whereas AS patients lack a maternal copy of an essential region from 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the critical regions for these syndromes are much smaller than the chromosomal region commonly deleted that often includes the P gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>Hypopigmentation</z:hpo> in PWS and AS patients is correlated with deletions of one copy of the human P gene that is highly homologous with its mouse counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A subset of PWS and AS patients also have OCA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients lack one copy of the P gene in the context of a PWS or AS deletion, with a mutation in the remaining chromosomal homologue of the P gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations in both homologues of the P gene of OCA2 patients who do not have PWS or AS have also been detected </plain></SENT>
