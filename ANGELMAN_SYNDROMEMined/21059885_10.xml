<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prototypical for such traits, calving ease is an important breeding objective of cattle (Bos taurus)-improving programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify QTL underlying calving ease, we performed a genome-wide association study using estimated breeding values (EBVs) as highly heritable phenotypes for paternal calving ease (pCE) and related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The massively structured study population consisted of 1800 bulls of the German Fleckvieh (FV) breed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two pCE-associated regions on bovine chromosomes (BTA) 14 and 21 (P = 5.72 × 10(-15) and P = 2.27 × 10(-8), respectively) were identified using principal components analysis to correct for population stratification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two most significantly associated SNPs explain 10% of the EBV variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since marker alleles with negative effect on pCE have positive effects on growth-related traits, the QTL may exert their effects on the birthing process through fetal growth traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The QTL region on BTA14 corresponds to a human chromosome (HSA) region that is associated with growth characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The HSA region corresponding to the BTA21 pCE QTL is maternally imprinted and involved in the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resequencing of positional candidate genes on BTA14 revealed a highly significantly (P = 1.96 × 10(-14)) associated polymorphism ablating a polyadenylation signal of the gene encoding ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates the leverage potential of EBVs in unraveling the genetic architecture of lowly heritable traits </plain></SENT>
