<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical reassessment and the use of molecular studies, including methylation analysis with an SNRPN probe, microsatellite analyses of D15S11, GABRB3 and D15S113 loci, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the SNRPN and GABRB3 probes, are consistent with a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> due to paternal isodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the fourth report case of a translocation 15q15q with paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that some patients with clinical features of AS have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>hyperphagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, and that these features should not rule out a diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
