<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that the SNRPN gene, which is defective in PWS, plays a central role in the imprinting-center regulation of the PWS/AS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To increase our understanding of the regulation of expression of this imprinted gene, we have developed single-cell-sensitive procedures for the analysis of expression of the SNRPN gene during early human development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcripts of SNRPN were detected in human oocytes and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of preimplantation development analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using embryos heterozygous for a polymorphism within the SNRPN gene, we showed that monoallelic expression from the paternal allele occurs by the 4-cell stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the imprinting epigenetic information inherited in the gametes is recognized already in the preimplantation embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The demonstration of monoallelic expression in embryos means that efficient preimplantation diagnosis of PWS may be made by analysis for the presence or absence of SNRPN <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
