<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chromosome 15 contains many segmental duplications, including some at 15q11-q13 that appear to be responsible for the deletions that cause Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> and for other genomic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current version of the human genome sequence is incomplete, with seven gaps in the proximal region of 15q, some of which are flanked by duplicated sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated this region by conducting a detailed examination of the sequenced genomic clones in the public database, focusing on clones from the RP11 library that originates from one individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our analysis has revealed assembly errors, including contig NT_078094 being in the wrong orientation, and has enabled most of the gaps between contigs to be closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have constructed a map in which segmental duplications are no longer interrupted by gaps and which together reveals a complex region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are two pairs of large direct repeats that are located in regions consistent with the two classes of deletions associated with Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are also large inverted repeats that account for the formation of the observed supernumerary marker chromosomes containing two copies of the proximal end of 15q and associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> when involving duplications of maternal origin (inv dup[15] syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We have produced a segmental map of 15q11-q14 that reveals several large direct and inverted repeats that are incompletely and inaccurately represented on the current human genome sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of these repeats are clearly responsible for deletions and duplications in known genomic disorders, whereas some may increase susceptibility to other disorders </plain></SENT>
