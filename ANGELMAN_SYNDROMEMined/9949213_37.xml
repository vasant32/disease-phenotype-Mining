<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the identification of the ancestral gene ( HERC2 ) and a family of duplicated, truncated copies that comprise these low-copy repeats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gene encodes a highly conserved giant protein, HERC2, that is distantly related to p532 (HERC1), a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) implicated in vesicular trafficking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mouse genome contains a single Herc2 locus, located in the jdf2 (juvenile development and fertility-2) interval of chromosome 7C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have identified single nucleotide splice junction mutations in Herc2 in three independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</z:chebi>-induced jdf2 mutant alleles, each leading to exon skipping with premature termination of translation and/or deletion of conserved amino acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mutations in Herc2 lead to the neuromuscular secretory vesicle and sperm acrosome defects, other developmental abnormalities and juvenile <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> of jdf2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined, these findings suggest that HERC2 is an important gene encoding a GEF involved in protein trafficking and degradation pathways in the cell </plain></SENT>
