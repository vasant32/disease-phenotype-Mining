<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities in the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region (PWACR) on chromosome 15 (q11-13) have been described in several individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined five microsatellite markers spread across the 4 Mb PWACR for linkage disequilibrium (LD) in 148 families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) and a subset of 82 families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> using the extended transmission disequilibrium test (ETDT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The markers examined were D15S11, D15S128, D15S1506, GABRB3, and D15S1002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition we have examined the microsatellite D15S822 for hemizygous deletion status in our sample as it had been previously reported to be increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no significant LD with any of the markers tested either in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> families when looking at paternal and maternal meioses combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, as there are known imprinted genes in the region, including possibly GABRB3, we also examined for LD in paternal and maternal meioses separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examining paternal transmissions only, we found marginal evidence for LD with a protective allele at marker D15S11 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> families (Chi-sq 7 df, P = 0.05) and marginal evidence for risk alleles at markers D15S1506 (Chi-sq 13.7, 6 df, P = 0.06), GABRB3 (Chi-sq 15.9, 8 df, P = 0.11) and D15S1002 (Chi-sq 17.7, 9 df, P = 0.08) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> only families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The allele responsible for the association with GABRB3 is the 191 allele which was previously reported to be overtransmitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemizygous deletion of the microsatellite D15S822 was found in 3 out of 340 independent chromosomes in our sample; a rate of 0.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is not significantly different to the frequency in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results did not rule out the involvement of this chromosomal region, but provided further evidence, albeit very limited, to implicate GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further more systematic work in larger samples is required and confirmation that GABRB3 is imprinted is desirable </plain></SENT>
