<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The larger type I deletions appear to coincide with more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000722'>obsessive-compulsive disorder</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The non-imprinted chromosomal segment between breakpoints 1 and 2 involves four highly conserved genes, TUBGCP5, NIPA1, NIPA2, and CYFIP1; the latter three are widely expressed in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, while TUBGCP5 is expressed in the subthalamic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These genes might explain the more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> seen in type I deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe nine cases with a microdeletion at 15q11.2 between BP1-BP2, thus having a haploinsufficiency for TUBGCP5, NIPA1, NIPA2, and CYFIP1 without Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of a pure BP1-BP2 microdeletion has been debated, however, our patients shared several clinical features, including delayed motor and speech development, dysmorphisms and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600104" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">obsessive-compulsive behaviour</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the deletion often appeared to be inherited from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or mildly affected parent, it was de novo in two cases and we did not find it in 350 healthy unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest a pathogenic nature for the BP1-BP2 microdeletion and, although there obviously is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo>, they support the existence of a novel microdeletion syndrome in 15q11.2 </plain></SENT>
