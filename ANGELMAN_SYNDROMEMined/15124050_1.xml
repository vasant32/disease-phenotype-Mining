<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on chromosomal abnormalities, an important cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, are limited in the Taiwanese literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the frequency and pattern of chromosomal abnormalities in school children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> in southern Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of 419 children were collected from November 1999 to January 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">fragile-X syndrome</z:e> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Metaphase chromosome preparations were obtained from peripheral blood cultures, and trypsin-giemsa (GTG) banded chromosomes were examined at the level of 500 to 600 bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization was done for cases whose karyotypes could not be determined by conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 419 enrollees with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, 10 had mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, while most had moderate to profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 22.43% of the cases, with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 being the major chromosomal abnormality, occurring in 77 cases (18.38%, 77/419 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sex chromosome <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidies</z:mp> were found in 3 cases (0.72%, 3/419 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Structural abnormalities of autosomes were found in 13 cases (3.10%, 13/419 cases), including deletion, markers, unbalanced translocations, and inversions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One subject was found to have <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 20 mosaicism (0.24%, 1/419) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal abnormalities occurred in a high proportion of mentally retarded school children from southern Taiwan, with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 21 being the most prevalent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the need for increased attention to prenatal, perinatal and postnatal screening in this population </plain></SENT>
