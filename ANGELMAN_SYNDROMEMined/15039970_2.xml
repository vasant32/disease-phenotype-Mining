<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A paracentric inversion of 15q11-q15 had previously been reported in this family but we show, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), that the rearrangement segregating in this family is not a paracentric inversion but an inverted intrachromosomal insertion, inv ins(15)(q15q13q11.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also describe a further recombinant resulting in a maternal duplication of the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This family illustrates the importance of distinguishing paracentric inversions from intrachromosomal insertions </plain></SENT>
