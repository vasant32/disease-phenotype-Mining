<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, severely impaired expressive language, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo>, tremulousness of limbs and a typical behavioral profile including a happy demeanour, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactive behavior</z:hpo> and low attention span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal electroencephalogram</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> are observed in &gt;80% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cognitive, language and orthopedic problems must be addressed with vigorous rehabilitation programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Classification of functioning disability and health, children and youth adaptation (ICF-CY) can provide the most adequate framework to describe the condition of the persons towards whom rehabilitative efforts are concentrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to test whether the ICF-CY framework is effectively able to capture the various dimensions of health in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied the ICF-CY, to the detail of second level codes, to a cohort of 11 patients with AS of various ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coding was obtained by the multi-professional team following these children for the rehabilitation program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The functional profile obtained applying the ICF-CY is complete and comparable with the characteristics of the syndrome described in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possibility of highlighting not only the problems but also the points of strength appears as very helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second level codes may be too broad to provide insight in the clinical and rehabilitative peculiarities, and the use of the full power of the classification may be more advisable for clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prelimiary study shows that ICF-CY is a valid tool to frame the clinical characteristics of a complex syndrome as AS, and may give a strong foundation for the rehabilitation programming </plain></SENT>
