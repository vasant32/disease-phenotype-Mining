<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chromosome 15q11-13 contains a cluster of imprinted genes essential for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mammalian neurodevelopment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deficiencies in paternal or maternal 15q11-13 alleles result in Prader-Willi or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, respectively, and maternal duplications lead to a distinct condition that often includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of maternally expressed imprinted genes is predicted to cause 15q11-13-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, but a link between gene dosage and expression has not been experimentally determined in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postmortem brain tissue was obtained from a male with 15q11-13 hexasomy and a female with 15q11-13 tetrasomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure 10 15q11-13 transcripts in maternal 15q11-13 duplication, Prader-Willi syndrome, and control brain samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Southern blot, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridisation were used to investigate epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gene expression and DNA methylation correlated with parental gene dosage in the male 15q11-13 duplication sample with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and milder Prader-Willi-like characteristics demonstrated unexpected deficiencies in the paternally expressed transcripts SNRPN, NDN, HBII85, and HBII52 and unchanged levels of maternally expressed UBE3A compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Paternal expression abnormalities in the female duplication sample were consistent with elevated DNA methylation of the 15q11-13 imprinting control region (ICR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expression of non-imprinted 15q11-13 GABA receptor subunit genes was significantly reduced specifically in the female 15q11-13 duplication brain without detectable GABRB3 methylation differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that genetic copy number changes combined with additional genetic or environmental influences on epigenetic mechanisms impact outcome and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of 15q11-13 duplication syndromes </plain></SENT>
