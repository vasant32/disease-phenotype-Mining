<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The D15S9 and D15S63 loci in the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region on chromosome 15 are subject to parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found two Prader-Willi syndrome families in which the patients carry a maternal methylation imprint on the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one of these families, the patients have a small deletion encompassing the gene for the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N, which maps 130 kb telomeric to D15S63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have identified a pair of nondeletion <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> sibs and two isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients who carry a paternal methylation imprint on the maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These Angelman and Prader-Willi syndrome patients may have a defect in the imprinting process in 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose a model in which a cis-acting mutation prevents the resetting of the imprinting signal in the germ line and thus disturbs the expression of imprinted genes in this region </plain></SENT>
