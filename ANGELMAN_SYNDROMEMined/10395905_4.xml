<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that the gene is differentially methylated, the maternal allele being methylated and the paternal allele being unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This maternal methylation is established promptly after fertilization prior to syngamy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also provide data that demonstrate the significance of methylation in the paternal expression of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of the Zfp127 gene in methyltransferase-deficient mice is significantly higher, suggesting that the gene is biallelically expressed in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data presented here will help to understand the mechanism by which the monoallelic expression of the entire 2-Mb Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> region is regulated </plain></SENT>
