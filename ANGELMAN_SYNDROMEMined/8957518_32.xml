<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laboratory diagnosis is currently performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA polymorphism (microsatellite) analysis, or DNA methylation analysis at locus PW71 (D15S63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined another parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation assay at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N gene (SNRPN) in patients referred with clinical suspicion of PWS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These included 30 PWS and 17 AS patients with known deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> status, and a larger cohort of patients (n = 512) suspected of PWS who had been analyzed previously for their methylation status at the PW71 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of SNRPN methylation were consistent with known deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) status as determined by other molecular methods in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 47 cases of PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the larger cohort of possible PWS patients, SNRPN results were consistent with clinical diagnosis by examination and with PW71 methylation results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide support for the use of SNRPN methylation as a diagnostic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because methylation analysis can detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three major classes of genetic defects associated with PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only patients with an abnormal methylation result require further diagnostic investigation by FISH or DNA polymorphism analysis to distinguish among the three classes for accurate genetic counseling and recurrence-risk assessment </plain></SENT>
