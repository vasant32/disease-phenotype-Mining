<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by deficiency of paternally expressed transcript(s) within the human chromosome region 15q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PWS patients harboring balanced chromosomal translocations with breakpoints within small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN) have provided indirect evidence for a role for the imprinted C/D box containing small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (snoRNA) genes encoded downstream of SNRPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed detailed phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses including chromosome analysis, array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH), expression studies, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for parent-of-origin determination of the 15q11.2 microdeletion on an 11-year-old child expressing the major components of the PWS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This child had an ∼236.29 kb microdeletion at 15q11.2 within the larger Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region that included the SNORD116 cluster of snoRNAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of SNP genotypes in proband and mother provided evidence in support of the deletion being on the paternal chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This child also met most of the major PWS diagnostic criteria including infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0008947'>hypotonia, early</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>hypogonadism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Array CGH testing for genomic copy-number changes in cases with complex phenotypes is proving to be invaluable in detecting novel alterations and enabling better genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
