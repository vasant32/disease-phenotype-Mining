<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E6-AP shows brain-specific imprinting and loss of function of maternally inherited E6-AP causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, how the loss of function of E6-AP causes disease pathogenesis is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that E6-AP interacts with and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E6-AP also directly ubiquitinates p27 in an in vitro ubiquitination assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial knockdown of E6-AP increases the level of p27 leading to cell cycle arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, partial knockdown also increases the transcription of p27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we have demonstrated the increased levels of p27 in E6-AP-maternal-deficient and null mice brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our result suggests that E6-AP not only enhances the degradation but also regulates the expression of p27 and its loss of function in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> might cause cell cycle alteration leading to disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
