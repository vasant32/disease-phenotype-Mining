<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in the activity and the dosage of E6AP are linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo>, respectively, highlighting the need for precise control of the enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the exception of HERC2, which modulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of E6AP, little is known about the regulation or function of E6AP normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a proteomic approach, we have identified and validated several new E6AP-interacting proteins, including HIF1AN, NEURL4, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>E6AP exists as part of several different protein complexes, including the proteasome and an independent high-molecular-weight complex containing HERC2, NEURL4, and MAPK6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In examining the functional consequence of its interaction with the proteasome, we found that UBE3C (another proteasome-associated ubiquitin ligase), but not E6AP, contributes to proteasomal processivity in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that E6 associates with the HERC2-containing high-molecular-weight complex through its binding to E6AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These proteomic studies reveal a level of complexity for E6AP that has not been previously appreciated and identify a number of new cellular proteins through which E6AP may be regulated or functioning </plain></SENT>
