<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present the cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic, and molecular genetic results on 20 unrelated patients with an interstitial duplication of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple probes showed that the Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) was included in the duplication in 4/20 patients, each ascertained with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The duplication was also found in two affected but not in three unaffected sibs of one of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four probands had inherited their duplication from their mothers, three of whom were also affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the affected mothers also carried a maternally inherited duplication, whereas the duplication in the unaffected mother and in an unaffected grandmother was paternal in origin, raising the possibility of a parental-origin effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PWACR was not duplicated in the remaining 16 patients, of whom 4 were referred with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 14 families for which parental samples were available, the duplication was inherited with equal frequency from a phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parent, mother or father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparative genomic hybridization undertaken on two patients suggested that proximal 15q outside the PWACR was the origin of the duplicated material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of PWACR probes discriminates between a large group of duplications of no apparent clinical significance and a smaller group, in which a maternally derived PWACR duplication is consistently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and speech difficulties but not with overt features of either Prader-Willi syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
