<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) of chromosome 15, designated "SMC(15)s," are the most common SMC in humans, accounting for as much as 60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the characterization of 46 large SMC(15)s, using both fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction analysis within and distal to the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region (PWACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to establish detailed information on origin, content, and breakpoints, to address the formation of SMC(15)s, and to facilitate genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom we were able to establish the parental origin, the SMC(15)s were maternally derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were observed who had familial SMC(15)s, both inherited from the mother; however, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remaining patients for whom parental samples were available, the SMC(15)s were shown to have arisen de novo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With one exception, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the SMC(15)s were shown to include the entire PWACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detailed investigations of the distal breakpoints categorized the SMC(15)s into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group A, representing approximately two-thirds of the SMC(15)s, had a breakpoint beyond the standard distal PWS/AS deletion breakpoint BP3, at a position close to the microsatellite marker D15S1010 and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome 10I10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group B SMC(15)s were shorter, with more variable breakpoints located around BP3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of the SMC(15)s were shown to have asymmetrical breakpoints, with the two inverted arms of the SMC being unequal in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed an unexpected level of complexity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> among SMC(15)s that is not seen in other chromosome 15 rearrangements, such as deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that multiple mechanisms are involved in the formation of large SMC(15)s </plain></SENT>
