<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones were isolated for 9 previously mapped DNA probes from this region, and for one newly derived marker, LS6-1 (D15S113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A YAC contig of 1-1.5 Mb encompassing four markers (ML34, IR4-3R, PW71, and TD189-1) was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of interphase nuclei was combined with YAC contig information to provide the following order of markers: cen-IR39-ML34-IR4-3R-PW71-TD189-1-LS6++ +-1-TD3-21-GABRB3-IR10-1-CMW1-tel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis was performed on 8 cases of PWS and 3 cases of AS, including 5 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eleven patients were deleted for YACs in the interval from IR4-3R to GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the proximal side of the deletion interval, 10/10 breakpoints fell within a single ML34 YAC of 370 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the distal side, 8/9 breakpoints fell within a single IR10-1 YAC of 200 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a striking consistency in the location of the proximal and distal breakpoints in PWS and AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis on a previously reported case of familial AS confirmed a submicroscopic deletion including YACs corresponding to LS6-1, TD3-21 and GABRB3 and supports the separation of the PWS and AS critical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since these three YACs do not overlap each other, the minimum size of the AS critical region is &gt; or = 650 kb </plain></SENT>
