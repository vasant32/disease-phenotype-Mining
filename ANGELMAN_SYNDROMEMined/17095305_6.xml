<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This deficiency is due to the deletion of the 15q11-q13 region, parental <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of the chromosome 15, or imprinting defect (ID) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation of the UBE3A gene causes approximately 10% of AS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this present study, we describe the molecular analysis and phenotypes of two PWS patients and four AS patients with ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the PWS patients has a non-familial imprinting center (IC) deletion and displayed a severe phenotype with an atypical PWS appearance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and psychiatric vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other PWS and AS patients did not present genetic abnormalities in the IC, suggesting an epimutation as the genetic cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The methylation pattern of two AS patients showed a faint maternal band corresponding to a mosaic ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of these mosaic patients displayed a mild AS phenotype while the other displayed a PWS-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
