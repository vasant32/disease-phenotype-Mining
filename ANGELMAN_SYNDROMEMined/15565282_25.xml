<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The maternally expressed UBE3A gene is affected in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four protein-encoding genes (MKRN3, MAGEL2, NDN and SNURF-SNRPN) and several small nucleolar (sno) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> genes (HBII-13, HBII-436, HBII-85, HBII-438A, HBII-438B and HBII-52) are expressed from the paternal chromosome only but their contribution to PWS is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine the role of the HBII-52 snoRNA genes, we have reinvestigated an AS family with a submicroscopic deletion spanning UBE3A and flanking sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By fine mapping of the centromeric deletion breakpoint in this family, we have found that the deletion affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 47 HBII-52 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the complete loss of the HBII-52 genes in family members who carry the deletion on their paternal chromosome is not associated with an obvious clinical phenotype, we conclude that HBII-52 snoRNA genes do not play a major role in PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the loss of HBII-52 has a phenotypic effect when accompanied by the loss of function of other genes in 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
