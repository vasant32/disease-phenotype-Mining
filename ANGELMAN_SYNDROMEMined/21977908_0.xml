<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) kits from MRC-Holland (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) were used to detect PWS and AS deletion subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with two versions of the MS-MLPA-PWS/AS kit (original A1 and newer B1) in determining methylation status and deletion subtypes in individuals with PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MS-MLPA analysis was performed on DNA isolated from a large cohort of PWS subjects with the MS-MLPA-PWS/AS-A1 and -B1 probe sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both MS-MLPA kits will identify deletions in the 15q11-q13 region but the original MS-MLPA-A1 kit has a higher density of probes at the telomeric end of the 15q11-q13 region, which is more useful for identifying individuals with atypical deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The newer B1 kit contains more probes in the imprinting center (IC) and adjoining small noncoding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> useful in identifying small microdeletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The A1 kit identified the typical deletions and smaller atypical deletions, whereas the B1 kit was more informative for identifying microdeletions including the IC and SNORD116 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both kits should be made available for accurate characterization of PWS/AS deletion subtypes as well as evaluating for IC and SNORD116 microdeletions </plain></SENT>
