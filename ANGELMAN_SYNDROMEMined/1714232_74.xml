<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 (bands 15q11q13) are found in the majority of patients with two distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The deleted regions in the two syndromes, defined cytogenetically and by using cloned DNA probes, are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, deletions in AS occur on the maternally inherited chromosome 15, and deletions in PWS occur on the paternally derived chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation has led to the suggestion that one or more genes in this region show differential expression dependent on parental origin (<z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genetic imprinting</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No genes of known function have previously been mapped to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show here that the gene encoding the GABAA (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>) receptor beta 3 subunit maps to the AS/PWS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deletion of this gene (GABRB3) was found in AS and PWS patients with interstitial cytogenetic deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evidence of beta 3 gene deletion was also found in an AS patient with an unbalanced 13;15 translocation but not in a PWS patient with an unbalanced 9;15 translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The localization of this receptor gene to the AS/PWS region suggests a possible role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in the pathogenesis of one or both of these syndromes </plain></SENT>
