<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene responsible for AS was discovered to be UBE3A and encodes for E6-AP, an ubiquitin ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A unique feature of this gene is that it undergoes <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> in a neuron-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the majority of AS cases, there is a mutation or deletion in the maternally inherited UBE3A gene, although other cases are the result of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> or mismethylation of the maternal gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While most human disorders characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> involve abnormalities in brain structure, no gross anatomical changes are associated with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we have determined that abnormal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) regulation is seen in the maternal UBE3A deletion AS mouse model and is responsible for the major phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Specifically, there is an increased Î±CaMKII phosphorylation at the autophosphorylation sites Thr(286) and Thr(305/306), resulting in an overall decrease in CaMKII activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CaMKII is not produced until after birth, indicating that the deficits associated with AS are not the result of developmental abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present studies are focused on exploring the potential to rescue the learning and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> in the adult AS mouse model through the use of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to increase neuronal UBE3A expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These studies show that increasing the levels of E6-AP in the brain using an exogenous vector can improve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> associated with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the associative learning deficit was ameliorated in the treated AS mice compared to the control AS mice, indicating that therapeutic intervention may be possible in older AS patients </plain></SENT>
