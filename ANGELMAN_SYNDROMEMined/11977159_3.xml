<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, it has been one of the more common submicroscopic telomere deletions seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the phenotypic overlap between <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 22q13.3 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, 44 patients with AS features but without one of the characteristic molecular 15q abnormalities were tested for 22qter deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the study group, 31/44 (70%) were heterozygous for locus D22S163 with probe cMS607 (distance 0.125 Mb from telomere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 13/44 (30%) patients were heterozygous for one or more of four microsatellite markers centromeric from D22S163 in the 22qter region (distances 1.5-4.3 Mb from telomere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the present study, there is no evidence that patients with an "Angelman-like" phenotype are more likely to have a 22qter deletion than other individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
