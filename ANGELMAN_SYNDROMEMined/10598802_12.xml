<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her clinical features form part of a common phenotype characteristic of PWACR duplications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260657" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural problems</z:e> and speech difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis showed that the duplication had arisen de novo, was maternal in origin and involved the entire 4-Mb PWACR between the common deletion breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The existence of cryptic rearrangements emphasises the need for molecular tests alongside conventional cytogenetics when investigating abnormalities involving this imprinted region </plain></SENT>
