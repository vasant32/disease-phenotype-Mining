<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Parental allele-specific methylation is hypothesized to be important in the establishment and maintenance of imprinted gene expression; however, dynamic changes in allele-specific patterns have been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The upstream regulatory region of the small nuclear riboprotein N gene (SNRPN) is an important imprinting control region (ICR) for establishing and maintaining the methylation imprint in the locus on 15q11-13 associated with Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare directly the role of allele-specific methylation patterns and the maintenance of imprinted expression in the PWS region, clonal populations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T lymphocytes were cultured for 22-25 generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A novel long-range semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy was utilized in order to span two different methylation sites, and a polymorphism within SNRPN was used so that allele-specific methylation of both sites could be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription/PCR followed by polymorphism analysis was also performed in order to determine parental allele-specific transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exclusive paternal expression at both SNRPN and IPW was maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> T cell clones and correlated with maternal methylation of the intron 1 NotI site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, biallelic methylation was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones at the previously described paternally methylated HpaII site in intron 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the maintenance of paternal expression of SNRPN and IPW correlates with a strict clonal maintenance of allele-specific methylation at the CpG-dense 5' end of SNRPN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differential maintenance of methylation sites within imprinted genes may depend on the density and chromatin organization of surrounding CpG sites </plain></SENT>
