<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of AS is based on a combination of clinical features and molecular genetic testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, molecular genetic testing (methylation analysis and UBE3A sequence analysis) identifies anomalies in about 90% of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aetiology of the remaining 10% is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a novel deletion encompassing the exons 5-12 of the UBE3A gene in a girl with AS, identified by MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification), which was not detected by the conventional diagnostic protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that copy number analysis of the UBE3A gene should be considered in individuals whose clinical examination is strongly suggestive of AS, after more common mechanisms have been excluded </plain></SENT>
