<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In humans and rodents, UBE3A/Ube3a transcript is maternally imprinted in several brain regions, but the distribution of native UBE3A/Ube3a(1) protein expression has not been comprehensively examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this, we systematically evaluated Ube3a expression in the brain and peripheral tissues of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and Ube3a maternal knockout mice (AS mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed a marked loss of Ube3a protein in hippocampus, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum in AS mice relative to WT littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, Ube3a expression in heart and liver of AS mice showed greater than the predicted 50% reduction relative to WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Co-localization studies showed Ube3a expression to be primarily neuronal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain regions and present in GABAergic interneurons as well as principal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that neuronal function throughout the brain is compromised in AS </plain></SENT>
