<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is due to the presence of a supernumerary marker chromosome formed by the inverted duplication of proximal chromosome 15, resulting in tetrasomy 15p and partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795859" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetrasomy 15q</z:e>, and containing the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region (PWS/ASCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of these idic(15) derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To better define the behavior profile, we studied 22 idic(15) children (15 males and 7 females) observed at our institute between 1986 and 2010, and present, in detail, case studies of five of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have been able to perform standardized and semi-standardized measures of intelligence, and psychopathology in only 13 of our 22 patients, due to the limitations of chronological age, and to the severity of ID (ranging from mild-moderate, in 15%, to severe-profound, in 85% of our sample) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show a distinct developmental profile in idic(15) patients, that may provide a behavioral signature for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>)/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>-like arising from the susceptibility locus on proximal 15q; and suggest that idic(15) individuals are not "true autistic," but distinct "autistic-like" persons with high score in the third ADOS-G and ADI-R area </plain></SENT>
