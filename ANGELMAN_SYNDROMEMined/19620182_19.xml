<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001258'>spastic paraplegias</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>) are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e> characterized by distal axonopathy of the longest corticospinal tract axons, and so their study provides an important opportunity to understand mechanisms involved in axonal maintenance and degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> genes encode proteins that localize to endosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of these is NIPA1 (non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> 1) and we have shown recently that its Drosophila homologue spichthyin inhibits bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling, although the relevance of this finding to the mammalian protein was not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show here that mammalian NIPA1 is also an inhibitor of BMP signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NIPA1 physically interacts with the type II BMP receptor (BMPRII) and we demonstrate that this interaction does not require the cytoplasmic tail of BMPRII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that the mechanism by which NIPA1 inhibits BMP signalling involves downregulation of BMP receptors by promoting their endocytosis and lysosomal degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease-associated mutant versions of NIPA1 alter the trafficking of BMPRII and are less efficient at promoting BMPRII degradation than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> NIPA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we demonstrate that two other members of the endosomal group of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> proteins, spastin and spartin, are inhibitors of BMP signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since BMP signalling is important for distal axonal function, we propose that dysregulation of BMP signalling could be a unifying pathological component in this endosomal group of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi>, and perhaps of importance in other conditions in which distal <z:mp ids='MP_0005405'>axonal degeneration</z:mp> is found </plain></SENT>
