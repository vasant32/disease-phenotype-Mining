<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified a new class of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> patients who have biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, but neither the typical deletion nor <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) or translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, these patients have uniparental DNA methylation throughout 15q11-q13, and thus appear to have a mutation in the imprinting process for this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe detailed clinical findings of five AS imprinting mutation patients (three families) and two PWS imprinting mutation patients (one new family) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients have essentially the classical clinical phenotype for the respective syndrome, except that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> is lower in imprinting mutation AS patients than in deletion AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, imprinting mutation AS and PWS patients do not typically have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo>, which is commonly found in patients with the usual large deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnosis of these cases is initially achieved by DNA methylation analyses of the DN34/ZNF127, PW71 (D15S63), and SNRPN loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter two probes have clear advantages in the simple molecular diagnostic analysis of PWS and AS patients with an imprinting mutation, as has been found for typical deletion or UPD PWS and AS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the recent finding of inherited microdeletions in PWS and AS imprinting mutation families, our studies define a new class of these two syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical and molecular identification of these PWS and AS patients has important genetic counseling consequences </plain></SENT>
