<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UBE3A, the gene associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, is part of a cluster of genes in the human chromosome 15q11-q13/mouse chromosome 7C region, that is subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In human and mouse brain, UBE3A is expressed predominantly from the maternal allele, and the paternal allele is silenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A current model concerning the evolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, the parental conflict hypothesis, posits that this epigenetic phenomenon is restricted to eutherian mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been recently reported, however, that several chicken orthologues of mammalian imprinted loci display DNA replication asynchrony, a property of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A separate group also reported monoallelic expression of chicken IGF2 in developing chicken embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations could suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> may occur in chicken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have assembled the predicted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> consensus sequence for the chicken UBE3A gene using published ESTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report a high degree of homology with the human UBE3A at the nucleotide and protein levels, as well as a highly conserved genomic organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biallelic expression of UBE3A is observed in embryonic chicken brain and limb, indicating that UBE3A is not subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in chicken </plain></SENT>
