<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A de novo deletion is present in 85% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten to 15% are familial cases with more than 90% due to a parental translocation and 5% due to an inversion of chromosome 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the size of the deleted segment varies, the critical segment that is deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients appears to be 5p15.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture is well known in younger patients and includes the typical high-pitched cry, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, growth rate failure, and craniofacial abnormalities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000311'>round face</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000431'>broad nasal bridge</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000494'>downward slanting palpebral fissures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With advancing age, the clinical picture becomes less striking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010314" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">5p deletion syndrome</z:e>, who were between age 16 and 47 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing their phenotype at several ages, a change of their phenotype was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the clinical characteristics became more evident such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000276'>long face</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>macrostomia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were severely or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020796" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">profoundly mentally retarded</z:e> except one patient who was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026106" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mildly mentally retarded</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was difficult to make in some of the patients who were first seen at an older age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In some of them, the craniofacial appearance resembled that seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients had periods of destructive behavior, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000742'>self mutilation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis should be confirmed as soon as possible with cytogenetic investigation to provide specific support, prevention, and treatment of complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is important to perform follow-up studies in young children to determine their outcome after infant-stimulation programs </plain></SENT>
