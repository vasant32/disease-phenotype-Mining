<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) of DTI color-coded orientation maps, the fraction of fibers oriented in the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML) and superioinferior (SI) directions were determined in whole brain white matter of 7 children with AS (mean age: 70±25.78 months, 5 males) and 7 children with typical development (TD, mean age: 79.8±17.25 months, 4 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TBSS of FA map was also performed for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with AS had a significantly lower AP component than the TD group in 9 clusters (3 bilateral and 3 unilateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral clusters were located in inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation and arcuate fasciculus regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unilateral clusters involved left brainstem, left cingulum and right uncinate regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, children with AS had significantly lower ML component than the TD group in 4 clusters (2 in corpus callosum and 2 unilateral clusters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unilateral clusters were located in the left cingulum and left anterior thalamic radiation regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SI component was lower in children with AS in two clusters compared to TD (corticospinal tract and corpus callosum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FA map clusters mostly corresponded with component clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Children with AS have a global impairment of white matter integrity including AP, ML and SI components in whole brain suggesting a potential underlying error with axon guidance mechanisms during brain development possibly due to loss of UBE3A gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some of this aberrant connectivity can be related to the clinical features of AS </plain></SENT>
