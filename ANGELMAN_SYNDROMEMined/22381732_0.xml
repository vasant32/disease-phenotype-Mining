<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a human neuropsychiatric disorder associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, motor abnormalities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, AS is caused by the deletion of the maternal copy of UBE3A gene, which encodes the enzyme ubiquitin ligase E3A, also termed E6-AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mouse model of AS has been generated and these mice exhibit many of the observed neurological alterations in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of clinical and neuroanatomical similarities between AS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, we examined AS model mice for alterations in the neuregulin-ErbB4 pathway, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We focused our studies on the hippocampus, one of the major brain loci impaired in AS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the expression of neuregulin 1 and ErbB4 receptors in AS mice and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates (ages 10-16 weeks) and studied the effects of ErbB inhibition on long-term potentiation in hippocampal area cornu ammonis 1 and on hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed enhanced neuregulin-ErbB4 signaling in the hippocampus of AS model mice and found that ErbB inhibitors could reverse deficits in long-term potentiation, a cellular substrate for learning and memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that an ErbB inhibitor enhanced long-term contextual fear memory in AS model mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neuregulin-ErbB4 signaling is involved in synaptic plasticity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> in AS model mice, suggesting that ErbB inhibitors have therapeutic potential for the treatment of AS </plain></SENT>
