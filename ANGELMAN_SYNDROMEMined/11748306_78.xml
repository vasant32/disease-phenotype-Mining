<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a severe neurobehavioural disorder caused by defects in the maternally derived imprinted domain located on 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients acquire AS by one of five mechanisms: (1) a large interstitial deletion of 15q11-q13; (2) paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) of chromosome 15; (3) an imprinting defect (ID); (4) a mutation in the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase gene (UBE3A); or (5) unidentified mechanism(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> classical patients from these classes exhibit four cardinal features, including severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002187'>mental retardation, profound</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech impairment</z:hpo>, a movement and balance disorder, and AS specific behaviour typified by an easily excitable personality with an inappropriately happy affect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients can display other characteristics, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We restricted the present study to 104 patients (93 families) with a classical AS phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of our patients were evaluated for 22 clinical variables including growth parameters, acquisition of motor skills, and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, molecular and cytogenetic analyses were used to assign a molecular class (I-V) to each patient for genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our patient repository, 22% of our families had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA methylation analyses along 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 44% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> patients had mutations within UBE3A, the largest percentage found to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the five molecular classes can be divided into four phenotypic groups: deletions, UPD and ID patients, UBE3A mutation patients, and subjects with unknown aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Deletion patients are the most severely affected, while UPD and ID patients are the least </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differences in body mass index, head circumference, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity are the most pronounced among the classes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinically, we were unable to distinguish between UPD and ID patients, suggesting that 15q11-q13 contains the only significant maternally expressed imprinted genes on chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
