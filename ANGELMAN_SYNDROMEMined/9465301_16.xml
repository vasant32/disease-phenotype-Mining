<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous UBE3A cDNA analysis has shown a coding region of approximately 2.6 kb and a 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of &lt; 50 bp, whereas Northern analysis has indicated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> sizes of 5-8 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed additional cDNA clones and provide evidence for an additional 0.5 kb of 5'-UTR and &gt; 2 kb of 3'-UTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have established the genomic organization of UBE3A and the sequence of intron-exon borders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have also mapped two highly homologous processed pseudogenes, UBE3AP1 and UBE3AP2, to chromosomes 2 and 21, respectively, and determined their genomic organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results will form the basis for studies of mutation and imprinting of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
