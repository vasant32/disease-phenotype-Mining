<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using two cosmid probes (41A and P13) from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MDLS">Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS)</z:e> critical region in 17p13.3 was performed in a blinded comparison of three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with submicroscopic deletions and in four <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relatives used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The controls showed both chromosome 17 homologues labeled in 85%-95% of cells, while each patient showed only one homologue labeled in 75%-80% of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients with cryptic translocations were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one case, a patient and her mother had the same der(17) (p+), but the reciprocal product of the translocation could not be identified in the mother by G-banding (i.e., it was a "half-cryptic" translocation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FISH revealed a 3q;17p translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other case involved a patient with apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because a large molecular deletion was found, a translocation involving two G-negative telomeres (i.e., a "full-cryptic" translocation) was postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FISH studies on her father and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brother showed an 8q;17p translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MDLS">Miller-Dieker syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More important, parental studies by FISH on patients demonstrating molecular deletions and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype may identify cryptic translocation events, which cannot be detected by other molecular genetic strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similar in situ strategies for deletion detection can be developed for other microdeletion syndromes, such as Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
