<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Self-injurious and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggressive behaviours</z:hpo> are reported as components of some behavioural phenotypes but there are few studies comparing across syndrome groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the prevalence of these behaviours and the associated person characteristics in seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Questionnaire data on self-injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo>, mood, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> and repetitive behaviour were collected on Angelman (AS, n=104), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1393998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Cornelia de Lange</z:e> (CdLS, 101), Cri <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e> Chat (CdCS, 58), Fragile X (FXS, 191), Lowe (LS, 56), Prader-Willi (PWS, 189) and Smith-Magenis (SMS, 42) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significantly higher prevalence of self-injury was evident in CdCS, CdLS, FXS, PWS, LS and SMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> was significantly heightened in AS and SMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Self-injury was associated with repetitive and impulsive behaviour in CdLS, FXS, PWS and LS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100710'>Impulsivity</z:hpo> and overactivity were significantly higher in those showing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> syndrome groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data quantify the risk for self-injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000718'>aggression</z:hpo> in the syndromes studied with implications for early intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associations between these behaviours and person characteristics both within and between syndromes warrant further research </plain></SENT>
