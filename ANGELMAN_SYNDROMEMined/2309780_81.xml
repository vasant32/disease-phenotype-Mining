<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that apparently similar deletions of chromosome 15q occur commonly in the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distinctness of the syndromes suggests that the deletions are not identical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this possibility, the specific bands involved and the sizes of the deletions were compared in seven patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> using high-resolution G-, Q-, and fluorescent R-banding techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parental origin of the nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> for which parents were available for study was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same proximal band was deleted (q11.2) in both syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, the deletion in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> was larger, though variable, and included bands q12 and part of q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the studied deletions in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were of maternal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the predominant paternal origin of the deletion in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two possible reasons for these observations are postulated: 1) the deleted regions are different at the cytologic and/or molecular level because of different exchange points in meiosis in males and females or to different mechanisms of breakage in males and females, resulting in differing breakpoints; 2) the deleted regions are essentially the same, but differential expression of the genes in the homologous chromosome 15 has occurred (imprinting) </plain></SENT>
