<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 10-15% of suspected cases of AS these investigations do not reveal a genetic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the development of a semi-quantitative dosage PCR technique used to identify sub-microscopic deletions involving UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this method we analysed a panel of 26 patients from 24 families, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fulfilling the clinical criteria for AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a deletion of UBE3A exons 8-16 in a sibling pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of parental samples revealed the same deletion in their phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is an inexpensive and valuable method for detecting UBE3A deletions in a small but important proportion of AS cases of unidentifiable cause </plain></SENT>
