<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with disorders involving imprinted genes such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) can have a mutation in the imprinting mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we identified an imprinting center (IC) within chromosome 15q11-ql3 and proposed that IC mutations block resetting of the imprint, fixing on that chromosome the parental imprint (epigenotype) on which the mutation arose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now describe four new microdeletions of the IC, the smallest (6 kb) of which currently defines the minimal region sufficient to confer an AS imprinting mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The AS deletions <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> overlap this minimal region, centromeric to the PWS microdeletions, which include the first exon of the SNRPN gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of five genes or transcripts in the 1.0 Mb vicinity of the IC (ZNF127, SNRPN, PAR-5, IPW, and PAR-1), each normally expressed only from the paternal allele, was expressed in cells from PWS imprinting mutation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AS imprinting mutation patients show biparental expression of SNRPN and IPW but must lack expression of the putative AS gene 250-1000 kb distal of the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data strongly support a model in which the paternal chromosome of these PWS patients carries an ancestral maternal epigenotype, and the maternal chromosome of these AS patients carries an ancestral paternal epigenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IC therefore functions to reset the maternal and paternal imprints throughout a 2-Mb imprinted domain within human chromosome 15q11-q13 during gametogenesis </plain></SENT>
