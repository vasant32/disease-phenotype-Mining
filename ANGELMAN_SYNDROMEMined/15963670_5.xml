<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the results of long-term follow-up studies on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and EEG findings of 23 cases of deletion type AS confirmed by FISH analysis, including seven cases previously reported by Matsumoto et al. in 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age at last follow-up in 23 patients was from 1 to 37 years of age (average: 18.0 years), with 10 patients (43.5%) in their 20s, and five over 30 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>Status epilepticus</z:hpo> was seen in 11 patients (47.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free for more than 3 years were 25% (4/16) at 10 years of age, 70% (7/10) at 20, and 80% (4/5) at 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EEG findings were classified into six patterns according to the previous report: N (no spike, including focal slow waves), HVS (diffuse high-voltage slow bursts with or without spikes), F (focal spikes or multifocal spikes), S (diffuse spike and waves), C (continuous diffuse spike and waves), Hy (hypsarrythmia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002521'>hypsarrhythmia</z:hpo> like waves) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hy was noted at ages 0-2 years in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>C was observed from the ages 2 to 15 years, being most frequently noted at 3-6 years of age, and it was never seen after 16 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>S was observed from ages 1 to 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>F was seen from 2 to 21 years of age, and most frequently during the ages of 2-7 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Even if the spikes disappear with age, when bi-frontal focal slow waves remain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> may occur even in patients over 30 </plain></SENT>
