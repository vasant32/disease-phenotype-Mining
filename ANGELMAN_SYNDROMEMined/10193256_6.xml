<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A postal questionnaire was sent to members of one of the UK lay groups for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (ASSERT) who had a child affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire requested general medical information and information about the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, its treatment, and treatment responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty questionnaires were sent out with an ASSERT routine mailing and 78 completed questionnaires were returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty three patients were boys and 35 were girls; ages ranged from 1.7 to 25 years (mean 7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall general clinical and cytogenetic data were mostly consistent with previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was reported in 68 children, most of whom had a detectable cytogenetic deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types reported by the families were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002121'>absence seizures</z:hpo>, tonic clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>drop attacks</z:hpo>, and myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; in four patients only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002373'>febrile seizures</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was &lt; 2 years in more than half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> drug treatment with valproate (VPA), clonazepam (CZP), and lamotrigine (LTG) as monotherapy or a combination of VPA and CZP or VPA and LTG was more often viewed favourably and considered effective with fewer side effects on the child's behaviour and alertness, versus more frequent adverse effects and increased frequency and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with carbamazepine (CBZ) and vigabatrin (VGB) in monotherapy or in combination with other anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> did tend to improve with age but were still present and disabling at older ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to record parents' opinions about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> drugs, and treatment responses in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and it is one of the largest series on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> to be reported to date </plain></SENT>
