<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the kinematics and kinetics of the squatting movement and associated electromyographic (EMG) activities in 20 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001264'>spastic diplegia</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023529" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periventricular leucomalacia</z:e> (SDPL) or AS and 18 unimpaired children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While movement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects consisted of vertical translation of most body segments, the movement of SDPL children was operated around the fixed knee with backward shift of the hip, and AS children performed a forward flexion of the trunk over the thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trunk stability was correlated with movement velocity in both pathological groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, anticipatory EMG pattern consisted of silencing of hamstring muscle tonic activity prior to movement <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This deactivation was not present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001264'>spastic diplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In SDPL, anticipatory overactivation of ankle joint actuators was recorded and tonic co-contraction persisted throughout the movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In AS, rhythmic EMG bursting was seen during the movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Shoulder, hip and knee trajectories in the sagittal plane showed marked within-group <z:hpo ids='HP_0000733'>stereotypies</z:hpo> in orientation, shape and length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patterns in both pathological groups were therefore distinctive </plain></SENT>
