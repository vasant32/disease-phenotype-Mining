<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deletions and other recurrent rearrangements of this region involve four common 'hotspots' for breakage, termed breakpoints 1-4 (BP1-BP4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Construction of an approximately 4 Mb YAC contig of this region identified multiple sequence tagged sites (STSs) present at both BP2 and BP3, suggestive of a genomic duplication event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interphase FISH studies demonstrated three to five copies on 15q11-q13, one copy on 16p11.1-p11.2 and one copy on 15q24 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, while analysis on two Class I deletion patients showed loss of approximately three signals at 15q11-q13 on one homolog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple FISH signals were also observed at regions orthologous to both human chromosomes 15 and 16 in non-human primates, including Old World monkeys, suggesting that duplication of this region may have occurred approximately 20 million years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A BAC/PAC contig for the duplicated genomic segment (duplicon) demonstrated a size of approximately 400 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the duplicon was found to contain at least seven different expressed sequence tags representing multiple genes/pseudogenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparison of STSs amplified from YAC clones uniquely mapped to BP2 or BP3 showed two different copies of the duplicon within BP3, while BP2 comprised a single copy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The orientation of BP2 and BP3 are inverted relative to each other, whereas the two copies within BP3 are in tandem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of large duplicated segments on chromosome 15q11-q13 provides a mechanism for homologous unequal recombination events that may mediate the frequent rearrangements observed for this chromosome </plain></SENT>
