<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the medical and developmental outcome of 34 singletons born after ICSI (20 males, 14 females; mean ages of 18 mo and 40 mo [SD 9 mo]; range 2 y 10 mo-4 y 8 mo) with 39 case control studies (21 males, 18 females; mean ages of 18 mo and 40 mo [SD 4 mo]; range 3 y-4 y 1 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each child was assessed physically and tested in three development domains (fine motor, gross motor, and language) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five children born after ICSI versus two control children (p=0.2) had major congenital anomalies (MaCAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four children born after ICSI versus no control children had severe MaCAs (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were defined as having a significant impact on development or causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0595985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Hanhart syndrome</z:e> (n=1), and persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000825'>hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia</z:hpo> of infancy (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping in 23 children born after ICSI revealed no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An imprinting defect was found in the child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of developmental assessment were in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at the age of 18 months except for the three children with Angelman and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0595985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Hanhart syndromes</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the second assessment, five more children born after ICSI and four control children showed abnormalities in one or more developmental domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there seems to be a higher frequency of severe major anomalies in children born after ICSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An increased risk for imprinting defects cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If we exclude children with severe MaCAs, the incidence of an abnormal somatic or neurodevelopmental outcome in the fourth year of life in children born after ICSI is similar to that of spontaneously conceived children </plain></SENT>
