<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For many years it was believed the brothers, who both have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, were affected by nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was because, apart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001344'>absent speech</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, the phenotype of the two men was not characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the cousin, in addition to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002463'>language impairment</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo>, has <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the three have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and so in the presence of the brothers' <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> was not considered until a diagnosis was made in the younger distant cousin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report on a familial imprinting center deletion and the importance of considering the mild and atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> phenotypes within the differential diagnosis of intellectual handicap, particularly in clarifying the genetic risk to other family members </plain></SENT>
