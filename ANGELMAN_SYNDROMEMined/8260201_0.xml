<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A molecular-genetic study was performed in 61 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and 14 patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analyses and/or PCR-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphism (DNRP) analyses revealed that 67% of AS patients have DNA deletions ranging from D15S9 to D15S12 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An exception was 3 sib cases whose deletion involved only 2 loci, D15S10 and GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parental origin of the deletions in AS patients were exclusively maternal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) was found in our AS patient series, suggesting that UPD in AS is infrequent than that in PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular deletions were observed in 6 of the 14 PWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to develop a simple, reliable DNA-based diagnostic method, I adopted PCR-mediated DNRPs as genetic markers for the detection of deletions and/or parental origin of chromosomes 15 in AS and/or PWS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This method gave useful diagnostic information in 33 (89%) of 37 AS patients and 12 (86%) of 14 PWS patients, indicating no big difference from the information obtained with Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since this DNRP method dose not require radioisotopes, it may be a first-choice, alternative way when diagnosing AS or PWS patients </plain></SENT>
