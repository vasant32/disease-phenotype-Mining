<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Prader-Willi/Angelman imprinted domain on human chromosome 15q11-q13 is regulated by an imprinting control center (IC) composed of a sequence around the SNRPN promoter (PWS-SRO) and a sequence located 35 kb upstream (AS-SRO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously hypothesized that the primary imprint is established on AS-SRO, which then confers imprinting on PWS-SRO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we examine this hypothesis using a transgene that includes both AS-SRO and PWS-SRO sequences and carries out the entire imprinting process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epigenetic features of this transgene resemble those previously observed on the endogenous locus, thus allowing analyses in the gametes and early embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the primary imprint is in fact established in the gametes, creating a differentially methylated CpG cluster (DMR) on AS-SRO, presumably by an adjacent de novo signal (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The DMR and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16991">DNS</z:chebi> bind specific proteins: an allele-discrimination protein (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) and a de novo methylation protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, being a maternal protein, is involved in both the establishment of DMR in the gametes and in its maintenance through implantation when methylation of PWS-SRO on the maternal allele takes place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, while the AS-SRO is required in the gametes to confer methylation on PWS-SRO, it is dispensable later in development </plain></SENT>
