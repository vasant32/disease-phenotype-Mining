<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the first in-depth study of how a human imprinted domain evolved, analyzing a domain containing several imprinted genes that are involved in human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using comparisons of orthologous genes in humans, marsupials, and the platypus, we discovered that the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region on human Chromosome 15q was assembled only recently (105-180 million years ago) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This imprinted domain arose after a region bearing UBE3A (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>) fused with an unlinked region bearing SNRPN (Prader-Willi syndrome), which had duplicated from the non-imprinted SNRPB/B' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This region independently acquired several retroposed gene copies and arrays of small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> from different parts of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In their original configurations, SNRPN and UBE3A are expressed from both alleles, implying that acquisition of imprinting occurred after their rearrangement and required the evolution of a control locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the evolution of imprinting in viviparous mammals is ongoing </plain></SENT>
