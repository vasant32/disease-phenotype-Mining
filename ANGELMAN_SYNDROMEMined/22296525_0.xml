<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study explored differences in sibling relationships between children with a typically-developing sibling (n = 55) and children with a sibling with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (n = 44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sibling relationships were compared on four factors and 16 sub-scales of the Sibling Relationship Questionnaire-Revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results showed significant differences in mean scores on each of the four factors (i.e. Warmth/Closeness, Conflict, Rivalry and Dominance/Nurturance) and most of the sub-scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ANCOVAs showed that demographic variables (number of siblings, living in a two-parent vs single parent household, gender, participant's age, place of residence) did not influence significant differences in sibling relationships between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Having a brother or sister with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> may influence the way in which the sibling perceives the sibling relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may have important implications for family-centred intervention for this population </plain></SENT>
