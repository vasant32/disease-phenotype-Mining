<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BrdU-33258 Hoechst-Giemsa techniques were used to analyze and compare the late replication patterns in the 15q11.2q12 region between the homologs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asynchronous replication between the homologs was observed in both amniocytes and fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From cells of a marker 15 of known parental origin, the paternal 15q11.2q12 replicated earlier than that of the maternal 15 in 92%-95% of asynchronous metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 5%-8% of asynchronous metaphases displayed maternal early/paternal late replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mosaic pattern of replication in the 15q11.2q12 region may be due to methylation mosaicism of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> or a relative lack of self-control of replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide cytogenetic evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> and delayed replication in the 15q11.2q12 region </plain></SENT>
