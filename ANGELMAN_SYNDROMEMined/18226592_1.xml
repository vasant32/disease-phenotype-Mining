<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the second instance of a complex unbalanced rearrangement consisting of distal <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 6p and 20q due to the concurrent transposition of distal 6p and 20q to the 22q telomere, previously described as a benign familial chromosomal variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the previous case, the nonpathogenicity of the rearrangement was based on the absence of genotypic differences between the affected proband and his <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> father, and on the absence of imprinted genes in the unbalanced region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now describe the same variant in an unrelated affected subject, in whom testing confirmed the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and in his healthy father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular investigations confirmed that the two families have an identical subtelomeric rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, genotyping of the flanking sequences on 22q showed a completely different pattern in the two families, demonstrating that they are indeed unrelated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Array-CGH analysis with a resolution of approximately 20 kb (Kit 244A, Agilent) defined a deletion size of 5.9 Mb on 15q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other imbalances were visible at subtelomeric regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further Array-CGH analysis using DNA of the proband (as test) and his mother (as reference) did not detect any duplication at the 6p and 20q subtelomeric regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proband and his father appear to have a copy number of the transposed regions equal to that of individuals with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> repartition of the subtelomeric regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is not suggestive of a <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> but rather of CNV regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This type of rearrangement could define a new class of polymorphic variants, i.e. positional variants, as observed for pericentromeric heterochromatin </plain></SENT>
