<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether any of the Prader Willi Angelman Chromosome Region (PWCR and ANCR, respectively) loci were duplicated in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the patients could be categorized into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group showed no duplication of the PWCR ANCR loci and appeared to belong to the dup(15)(q12) class which is phenotypically silent and is therefore called the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second group also showed no duplication of the PWCR/ANCR loci. but had a large alpha satellite variant with D15Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that these patients do not have a duplication of 15q12 but rather a centromeric variant which mimics the dup(15)(q12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the importance of evaluating apparent variations in the proximal region of chromosome 15 with FISH </plain></SENT>
