<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical importance of the larger markers in association with the critical region is mentioned in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reports related to marker chromosome 15, and smaller markers are solely associated with minor dysmorphic features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0000809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent miscarriages</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these small sSMC(15)s without the PWACR may also determine a specific phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A dysmorphic examination of an azoospermic patient in a genetics clinic was performed and was followed by a peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal analysis according to standard cytogenetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nucleolar region (NOR) banding, C-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization and a molecular investigation of Y-microdeletions were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical evaluation identified dysmorphic features accompanied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> and severe '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024638" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angle Class II</z:e>, Division 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>Open Bite</z:hpo> Deformity' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The molecular cytogenetic study revealed the small sSMC(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, a Y-microdeletion analysis showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> was not the result of a deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the presented case might represent a coincidental example of supernumerary marker 15 and mandibular anomaly association, the condition may also define a specific phenotype that may be more than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000027'>azoospermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This condition may be characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>malar hypoplasia</z:hpo>, mandibular anomaly, keloid formation and minor dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
