<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological deficits which include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>global developmental delay</z:hpo>, moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>intellectual impairment</z:hpo>, absent or severely <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241210" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delayed speech</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001319'>neonatal hypotonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, more than 50% of patients show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> or autistic-like behavior, and therefore it can be classified as a syndromic form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorders</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis includes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">fragile X syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FGS|FGS1">FG syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over 600 cases of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome have been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most are terminal deletions of âˆ¼100 kb to &gt;9 Mb, resulting from simple deletions, ring chromosomes, and unbalanced translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these deletions include the gene SHANK3 which encodes a scaffold protein in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses, connecting membrane-bound receptors to the actin cytoskeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two mouse knockout models and cell culture experiments show that SHANK3 is involved in the structure and function of synapses and support the hypothesis that the majority of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome neurological defects are due to haploinsufficiency of SHANK3, although other genes in the region may also play a role in the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The molecular connection to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> suggests that potential future treatments may involve modulation of metabotropic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
