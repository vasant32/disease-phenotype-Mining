<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (PWS and AS) typically result from an approximately 4-Mb deletion of human chromosome 15q11-q13, with clustered breakpoints (BP) at either of two proximal sites (BP1 and BP2) and one distal site (BP3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HERC2 and other duplicons map to these BP regions, with the 2-Mb PWS/AS imprinted domain just distal of BP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously, the presence of genes and their imprinted status have not been examined between BP1 and BP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we identify two known (CYFIP1 and GCP5) and two novel (NIPA1 and NIPA2) genes in this region in human and their orthologs in mouse chromosome 7C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These genes are expressed from a broad range of tissues and are nonimprinted, as they are expressed in cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, patients with PWS or AS, and the corresponding mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, replication-timing studies in the mouse reveal that they are located in a genomic domain showing asynchronous replication, a feature typically ascribed to monoallelically expressed loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The novel genes NIPA1 and NIPA2 each encode putative <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> with nine transmembrane domains, suggesting function as receptors or as transporters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses show that NIPA1 and NIPA2 are highly conserved in vertebrate species, with ancestral members in invertebrates and plants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, evolutionary studies show conservation of the four-gene cassette between BP1 and BP2 in human, including NIPA1/2, CYFIP1, and GCP5, and proximity to the Herc2 gene in both mouse and Fugu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations support a model in which duplications of the HERC2 gene at BP3 in primates first flanked the four-gene cassette, with subsequent transposition of these four unique genes by a HERC2 duplicon-mediated process to form the BP1-BP2 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Duplicons therefore appear to mediate genomic fluidity in both disease and evolutionary processes </plain></SENT>
