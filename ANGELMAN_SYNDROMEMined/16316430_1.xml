<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until present, preference assessment in AS has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An adapted Dutch version of the Choice Assessment Scale (CAS) was administered by parents and other caregivers to 105 individuals with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CAS was adapted by adding several items related to water and by adding a sub-scale describing activities and materials that individuals may avoid or escape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The five sub-scales and total scale of the modified CAS had good internal consistency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Water-related items were more often scored as preferred than non-water-related items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No associations were found between sub-scale and total scale scores and demographic characteristics (e.g. genetic subtype, age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that people with AS often have strong preferences for water-related items </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The modified CAS is a reliable and sensitive instrument to assess client preferences </plain></SENT>
