<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of the maternally expressed Ube3a gene in experience-dependent development and plasticity of the mouse visual system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated by optical imaging, rapid ocular dominance (OD) plasticity after brief monocular deprivation (MD) was severely impaired during the critical period (CP) in the visual cortex (VC) of Ube3a maternal-deficient (m-/p+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolonged MD elicited significant plasticity in m-/p+ mice that never matched the level seen in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In older animals after the CP, 7-day MD elicited mild OD shifts in both control and m-/p+ mice; however, the OD shifts in m-/p+ mice lacked the strengthening of visual responses to the two eyes characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult plasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anatomic effects of the maternal deficiency include reduced spine density on basal, but not apical, dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the binocular region of the VC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imprinting of Ube3a expression was not fully established in the early postnatal period, consistent with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of cortical retinotopy and visual acuity that we observed in m-/p+ mice, but was fully established by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that paternal and maternal genomes are not functionally equivalent for cortical plasticity, and that maternally expressed Ube3a is required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> experience-dependent modification of cortical circuits during and after the CP </plain></SENT>
