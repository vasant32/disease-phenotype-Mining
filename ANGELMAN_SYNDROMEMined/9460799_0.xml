<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her karyotype revealed a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 15 with a partial deletion from 15pter to the Angelman region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several members of her family appeared to be carriers of the same translocation, but showed no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The karyotypes showed a marker chromosome, that was not present in the female with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the marker chromosome corresponded to material from chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study is in agreement with the suggestion that <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> is one of the mechanisms involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
