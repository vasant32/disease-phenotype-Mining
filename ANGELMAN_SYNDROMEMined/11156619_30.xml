<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several cytogenetic alterations affect the distal part of the long arm of human chromosome 15, including recurrent rearrangements between 12p13 and 15q25, which cause congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100244'>fibrosarcoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here the construction of a BAC/PAC contig map that spans 2 Mb from the neurotrophin-3 receptor (NTRK3) gene region on 15q25.3 to the proximal end of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005859" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Bloom's syndrome</z:e> region on 15q26.1, and the identification of a set of new chromosome 15 duplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contig reveals the existence of several regions of sequence similarity with other chromosomes (6q, 7p, and 12p) and with other 15q cytogenetic bands (15q11-q13 and 15q24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One region of similarity maps on 15q11-q13, close to the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (PWS/AS) imprinting center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 12p similar sequence maps on 12p13, at a distance to the ets variant 6 (ETV6) gene that is equivalent on 15q26.1 to the distance to the NTRK3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These two genes are the targets of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> recurrent translocations, suggesting that misalignments between these two chromosomes regions could facilitate recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most striking similarity identified is based on a low copy repeat sequence, mainly present on human chromosome 15 (LCR15), which could be considered a newly recognized duplicon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At least 10 copies of this duplicon are present on chromosome 15, mainly on 15q24 and 15q26 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One copy is located close to a HERC2 sequence on the distal end of the PWS/AS region, three around the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32568">lysyl</z:chebi> oxidase-like (LOXL1) gene on 15q24, and three on 15q26, one of which close to the IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) gene on 15q26.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These LCR15 span between 13 and 22 kb and contain high identities with the golgin-like protein (GLP) and the SH3 domain-containing protein (SH3P18) gene sequences and have the characteristics of duplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because duplicons flank chromosome regions that are rearranged in human genomic disorders, the LCR15 described here could represent new elements of rearrangements affecting different regions of human chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
