<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to compare automated fragment detection and analysis with conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> analysis the delta F508 mutation in exon 10 of the cystic <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene was multiplexed with two intragenic microsatellites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the Prader-Willi/Angelman region of chromosome 15 used a panel of five microsatellites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For dystrophin, seven microsatellites covering the entire dystrophin gene were co-amplified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Automated analysis was faster and more accurate than analysis using radiolabelled products with sequencing gels, although some inconsistencies in the sizing of microsatellite alleles were seen </plain></SENT>
