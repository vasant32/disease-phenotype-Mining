<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Improved methods would facilitate the analysis of imprinting, and we describe a simple strategy designed to analyze transcripts for imprinting in mouse and human using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in combination with GC-clamped denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a demonstration, novel polymorphisms in the untranslated portions of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> between CBA/NJ and Skive strains of mice were identified and used to document paternal expression of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (Snrpn) in brain, maternal expression of H19 in liver, and biallelic expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenease (Gapd) in liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method was also used to demonstrate a new polymorphism and monoallelic expression of H19 in human peripheral leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assessment of imprinting for novel or unstudied transcripts requires identification and analysis of polymorphisms at the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level, and we believe that RT-PCR with DGGE is a preferred method for this application, with advantages over nuclease protection and other methods </plain></SENT>
