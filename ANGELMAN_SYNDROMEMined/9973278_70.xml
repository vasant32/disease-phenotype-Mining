<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IC controls resetting of parental imprints in 15q11-q13 during gametogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a larger series of cases of familial PWS, including one case with a deletion of only 7.5 kb, that narrows the PWS critical region to &lt;4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 kb spanning the SNRPN gene CpG island and exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification of a strong DNase I hypersensitive site, specific for the paternal allele, and six evolutionarily conserved (human-mouse) sequences that are potential transcription-factor binding sites is consistent with this region defining the SNRPN gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that promoter elements at SNRPN play a key role in the initiation of imprint switching during spermatogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also identified three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> PWS who have an imprinting mutation (IM) and no detectable mutation in the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An inherited 15q11-q13 mutation or a trans-factor gene mutation are unlikely; thus, the disease in these patients may arise from a developmental or stochastic failure to switch the maternal-to-paternal imprint during parental spermatogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies allow a better understanding of a novel mechanism of human disease, since the epigenetic effect of an IM in the parental germ line determines the phenotypic effect in the patient </plain></SENT>
