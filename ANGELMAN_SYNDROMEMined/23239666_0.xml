<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism for genome-wide paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) has been reported in only seven live born individuals to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation includes manifestations of multiple paternal UPD syndromes with high variability, likely due to the variable levels of mosaicism in different somatic tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report an eighth case in a female patient with mosaicism for genome-wide paternal UPD which highlights the complex clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient had features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e> (BWS), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0002079'>hyperinsulinism</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, organomegaly, hemihyperplasia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumors</z:e>, and cystic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis in our patient was established utilizing microarray-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis performed on leukocyte DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Targeted multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of chromosome regions 11p15 and 15q13 confirmed mosaicism for paternal UPD at these genomic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case represents the first report of microarray-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in the diagnosis of genome-wide paternal UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The application of microarray-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on selected individuals with complex clinical presentations could be a valuable diagnostic tool to improve the detection rate of mosaic genome-wide paternal UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach, which screens many loci simultaneously, is more cost-effective and less labor-intensive than performing multiple targeted DNA methylation-based assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification of individuals with mosaicism for genome-wide paternal UPD is an important goal as it confers a low recurrence risk for the family and identifies individuals who require surveillance due to increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
