<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously identified a testis-specific gene, C15orf2, which maps between NDN and SNURF-SNRPN and is expressed from both alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report on two novel genes (prader-willi region non-protein-coding <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> 1 and 2) located between NDN and C15orf2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By database search we found five partially duplicated copies, of which only one of each appears to be active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWRN2 is expressed only in testis and is biallelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PWRN1 is biallelically expressed in testis and kidney, but monoallelically in fetal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis of a CpG island 15 kb upstream of exon 1 showed absence of methylation in spermatozoa, but methylated and unmethylated alleles in fetal brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reinvestigation of C15orf2 revealed that this gene is also expressed in fetal brain and that expression in this tissue is monoallelic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PWRN1 and C15orf2 may play a role in PWS </plain></SENT>
