<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the molecular characterisation of two families with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> referred for prenatal diagnosis, in which atypical molecular findings resulted in counselling dilemmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first is a familial case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> in which the two affected children have mutations which affect the imprinting mechanism, as shown by the presence of paternal DNA methylation patterns at D15S63 and SNRPN and biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of 15q11-q13 markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA prepared from a 21 week fetal blood sample detected a fetus with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maternal and paternal DNA methylation patterns at D15S63, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the same maternal chromosome 15q11-q13 as the two affected sibs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is probably a result of germline mosaicism in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second is a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> with an atypical deletion of 15q11-q13, which involves both unusual proximal and distal breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deletion was characterised in order to assess the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> in a second pregnancy in the mother of this child </plain></SENT>
