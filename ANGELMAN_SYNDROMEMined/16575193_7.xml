<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present review focuses on the recent advances towards understanding the mode of operation of the imprinting center (IC) within the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (PWS/AS) domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis is put on the elucidation of the functional interaction between the two parts of the center, AS-IC and PWS-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recent studies, on which the review is based, reveal cis-acting elements and trans-acting proteins that constitute the two parts of the IC and presumably provide the molecular mechanism for this interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AS-IC acquires the primary imprint during gametogenesis by establishing the maternal epigenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unmethylated maternal allele of the AS-IC binds, very likely, a trans-acting factor that confers methylation on the PWS-IC maternal allele after fertilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that the PWS-IC paternal epigenotype, once established, spreads across the entire PWS/AS domain in the soma </plain></SENT>
