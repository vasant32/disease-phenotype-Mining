<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a new method for differential diagnosis of Prader-Willi (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes (AS)</z:e> that requires only a small amount of DNA including that obtained from amniocentesis specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This method not only proved to be robust and rapid, but, most importantly, it can be dosage sensitive, supplying additional information useful for genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After methylation-dependent digestion of DNA with HpaII or McrBC, exon 1 of the SNRPN gene is amplified together with a sequence in the CpG island of the H19 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the similarities in sequence composition and methylation status between the amplified sequences, their co-amplification under semiquantitative conditions allows an easy discrimination between single dosage (present in deletions or chromosomal translocations) and a double-dosage state (<z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> or imprinting error), when the appropriate controls are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The method we have developed in combination with standard cytogenetic studies and segregation analysis of microsatellite markers offers a rapid and easy procedure to resolve most suspected cases of PWS and AS, and consequently to provide accurate genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
