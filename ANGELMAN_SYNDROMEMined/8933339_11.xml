<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two unrelated PWS patients with a typical deletion, whose fathers have a balanced translocation involving the PWS/AS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite data suggest that the deletion is the result of an unequal crossover between the derivative chromosome 15 and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that familial translocations involving 15q11-q13 can give rise to interstitial deletions causing PWS or AS and that prenatal diagnosis in such families should include fluorescence in situ hybridisation or microsatellite studies or both </plain></SENT>
