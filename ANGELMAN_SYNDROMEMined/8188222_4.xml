<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) loci have been mapped to chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal deletions of differing parental origin in the two syndromes have been interpreted as being due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genetic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of patients with varying deletions has localized the AS locus to the interval between D15S113 and GABRB3 and the PWS locus between D15S13 and D15S113 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, DNA cloning and physical mapping techniques have been used to characterize the AS/PWS chromosome region in the vicinity of D15S10, a locus that is telomeric to D15S113 and centromeric to GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A CpG island near TD3-21 at D15S10 has been cloned, allowing the identification of a widely expressed 4.5-kb transcript and providing a novel DNA marker, OP3, at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OP3 and TD3-21 have been used to construct a long-range physical map extending over approximately 2800 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clusters of rare-cutting restriction sites on this map locate four other CpG islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since these CpG islands lie within the minimum deletion intervals for AS and PWS, they mark the possible locations of candidate genes for the two syndromes </plain></SENT>
