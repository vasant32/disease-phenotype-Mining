<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBE3A encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase and shows brain-specific imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe UBE3A coding-region mutations detected by SSCP analysis in 13 AS individuals or families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two identical de novo 5-bp duplications in exon 16 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the other 11 unique mutations, 8 were small deletions or insertions predicted to cause frameshifts, 1 was a mutation to a stop codon, 1 was a missense mutation, and 1 was predicted to cause insertion of an isoleucine in the hect domain of the UBE3A protein, which functions in E2 binding and ubiquitin transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the cases were familial, and five were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two familial cases and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> case, mosaicism for UBE3A mutations was detected: in the mother of three AS sons, in the maternal grandfather of two AS first cousins, and in the mother of an AS daughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequencies with which we detected mutations were 5 (14%) of 35 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases and 8 (80%) of 10 in familial cases </plain></SENT>
