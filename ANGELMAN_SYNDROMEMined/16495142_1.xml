<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the electroclinical phenotype in 5 patients with large supernumerary marker chromosome referred as inv dup (15), in an attempt to analyze the electroclinical spectrum in order to determine if the binomial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>-EEG is stereotyped enough to corroborate this challenging diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with large inv dup (15) were submitted to EEG and/or V-EEG, with a minimum duration of 2h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two certified neurophysiologists analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EEG tracings simultaneously, blinded to clinical and molecular data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was characterized by detailed history and a standard questionnaire according to International League Against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> guidelines and corroborated by V-EEG findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> started during infancy in 4 patients, in 3 with spasms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spasms were easily controlled in one but not in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> evolved with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo> in two patients and, generalized and focal in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Currently, 3 patients present refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and two are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one patient, only one isolated episode suggestive of a secondary generalized tonic-clonic event occurred at the age of 12 years without recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding the EEG, patients had distinct features, except for two patients with very high amplitude fast activity, resembling recruiting rhythm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite good <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in 3 patients, EEGs remained remarkably abnormal with frequent epileptiform discharges over poorly organized background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> electroclinical phenotype with generalized and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e>, presenting distinct degrees of severity and refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that it is not possible to delineate an electroclinical phenotype in this neurogenetic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inv dup (15) remains as a diagnostic challenge and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and EEG features are valuable only when inserted in the proper clinical context </plain></SENT>
