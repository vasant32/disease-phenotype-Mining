<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) accounts for approximately 25% of Prader-Willi patients (PWS) and paternal UPD for about 2-5% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings and the parental origin of deletions are evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in the cause of PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural occurrence of UPD individuals allows the study of meiotic mechanisms resulting in chromosomal nondisjunction (ND) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected patients with UPD15 from our sample of 30 PWS and 40 AS patients to study the origin of ND and the recombination along chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were analyzed with 10 microsatellites throughout the entire chromosome 15 (D15S541, D15S542, D15S11, D15S113, GABRB3, CYP19, D15S117, D15S131, D15S984, D15S115) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis disclosed seven heterodisomic PWS cases originating by meiosis I (MI) ND (four showed recombination and three no recombination), and one isodisomic PWS UPD15 originating by postzygotic duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the five paternal UPD15, we detected four isodisomies, three of which showed homozigosity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers, corresponding to a mitotic error, and one case originating from a paternal MII ND </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that besides maternal MI and MII ND, paternal ND occurs when a PWS UPD15 patient originates from mitotic duplication of the maternal chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ND events in AS are mainly due to mitotic errors, but paternal MII ND can occur and give origin to an AS UPD15 individual by two different mechanisms: rescue of a trisomic fetus or fertilization of a nullisomic egg with the disomic sperm, and in this case paternal and maternal ND are necessary </plain></SENT>
