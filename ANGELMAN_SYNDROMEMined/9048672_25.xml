<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and EEG features in a large group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients with AS with a proven chromosome 15q11-13 deletion were retrospectively analyzed with regard to their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and EEG findings by examination of patient files and EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIJ EEGs were reviewed by one of the authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A logistic regression model, with a follow-up from 1 to 39 years (mean, 15 years), was used for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had occurred in 30 (83%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 43% of them, the initial symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002373'>febrile convulsions</z:hpo> in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In childhood, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> could start with almost any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atypical absences and myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> prevailed in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were present in 92% of the adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most typical EEG findings were rhythmic triphasic delta waves of high amplitude with a maximum over the frontal regions, identified in 99 (66%) of 150 EEGs, and continuously or intermittently, in 30 (83%) of 36 patients with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 47% it was present even before a clinical diagnosis of AS was considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-amplitude rhythmic 4-6/s slow activity, seen in 44 (29%) of 150 EEGs, was not present after the age of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports suggesting a decreasing frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with age, we found that 92% of the adult patients with AS continued to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most typical EEG finding in AS, in both children and adults, was the presence of frontal triphasic delta waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In mentally retarded patients, this EEG pattern should point the physician in the direction of AS </plain></SENT>
