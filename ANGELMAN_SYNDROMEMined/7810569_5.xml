<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A much less frequent cause (4%) is paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> of the entire chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general no abnormalities are detectable in familial cases and an inherited submicroscopic deletion was described only once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here a familial case of 2 sibs with AS is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No major cytogenetic or molecular abnormality was identified, but a recombination event had occurred in the AS critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The AS locus, D15S113, D15S10, D15S11, and D15S18 mapped proximal and the GABRB3 gene, D15S97, the GABRA5 gene, and D15S12 distal to the crossover site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This recombination within the AS critical region confirmed the exclusion of GABRB3 as a candidate gene for AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other markers and candidate genes can be tested genetically as well for a possible role in AS </plain></SENT>
