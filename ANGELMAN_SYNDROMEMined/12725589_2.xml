<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 95 patients suspected with the clinical diagnosis of AS were evaluated and 37 cases (39%) were confirmed by cytogenetic or molecular studies as affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical analysis was performed according to a specific clinical protocol for the diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetical analysis was used to detect chromosome rearrangements by determining the karyotype in lymphocytes by GTG banding and revealed an abnormal karyotype in two cases (5.4%), both of them presenting a new pericentromeric inversion in chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analyses included determination of DNA methylation within the 15q11-13 region by Southern blotting and microsattelite analysis within the 15q11-13 region by PCR and the UBE3A gene was also studied by mutational screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases (43.2%) a de novo deletion was detected in the maternal chromosome 15:3 cases (8.1%) presented imprinting defect at the 15q11-13 region; one case is due to a paternal uniparental dissomy (2.7%) and another two cases showed a inherited mutation at the UBE3A gene (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases (35.1%) showed no deletion, no UPD, no imprinting defect, no UBE3A mutation and the diagnosis of AS could be ruled out in 58 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present work was to describe the clinical and laboratory protocols employed at our laboratory in order to establish the AS study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the protocols employed here were efficient for the diagnosis of AS, a frequently underdiagnosed pathology </plain></SENT>
