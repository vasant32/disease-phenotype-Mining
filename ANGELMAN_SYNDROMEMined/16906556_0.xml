<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> persons with probable AS or PWS (n = 184) were studied using the DNA methylation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individuals with abnormal methylation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> further tested by chromosomal and FISH analysis, and if necessary for <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and UBE3A gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen cases with abnormal methylation test result were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven of them had AS, including six (85.7%) due to 15q11-13 deletion and one paternal UPD15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve subjects had PWS: 4 (33%) 15q11-13 deletions, 6 (50%) maternal UPD15, 1 unbalanced chromosome 14;15 translocation resulting in a chromosome 15pter-q13 deletion, and 1 Robertsonian 15q;15q translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The minimum livebirth prevalence in 1984-2004 for AS was 1:52,181 (95% CI 1:25,326-1:1,29,785) and for PWS 1:30,439 (95% CI 1:17,425-1:58,908) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The livebirth prevalence of AS and PWS increased within this period, but the change was statistically significant only for PWS (P = 0.032), from expected 1:88,495 (95% CI 1:24,390-1:3,22,580) to expected 1:12,547 (95% CI 1:540-1:29,154) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six individuals with AS and 11 with PWS were alive on the prevalence day (January 1, 2005), indicating the point prevalence proportion of 1:56,112 (95% CI 1:25,780-1:1,52,899) and 1:30,606 (95% CI 1:17,105-1:61,311), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results showing the birth prevalence of AS 1.7 times less than PWS challenge the opinion that both syndromes are equally represented, and are in line with the view that mutations in sperm and oocytes occur at different frequencies </plain></SENT>
