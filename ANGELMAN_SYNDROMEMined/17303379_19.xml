<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Standard methods used for genomic methylation analysis allow the detection of complete absence of either methylated or non-methylated alleles but are usually unable to detect changes in the proportion of methylated and unmethylated alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compare two methods for quantitative methylation analysis, using the chromosome 15q11-q13 imprinted region as model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Absence of the non-methylated paternal allele in this region leads to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) whilst absence of the methylated maternal allele results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A proportion of AS is caused by mosaic imprinting defects which may be missed with standard methods and require quantitative analysis for their detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence-based quantitative methylation analysis (SeQMA) involves quantitative comparison of peaks generated through sequencing reactions after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is simple, cost-effective and can be easily established for a large number of genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, our results support previous suggestions that methods based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment may be problematic for exact quantification of methylation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) avoids <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It detects changes in both CpG methylation as well as copy number of up to 40 chromosomal sequences in one simple reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once established in a laboratory setting, the method is more accurate, reliable and less time consuming </plain></SENT>
