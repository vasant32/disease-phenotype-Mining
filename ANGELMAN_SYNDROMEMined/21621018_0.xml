<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SMC(15)s can be classified into two major groups according to their length: small SMC(15) and large ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Depending on the amount of euchromatin, the carriers may either present with a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> or with a recognizable syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, dysmorphic features and pigmentary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His karyotype was 47,XY,+mar[41]/46,XY[9] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed the SMC to be originating from chromosome 15, dicentric and containing four copies of the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> Critical Region (PWACR), including the OCA2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies indicated that it is maternally derived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report supports the previous observations assuming that severity of phenotype in patients with SMC(15) depends on the dosage of the PWACR and that skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> is correlated to OCA2 gene copy number </plain></SENT>
