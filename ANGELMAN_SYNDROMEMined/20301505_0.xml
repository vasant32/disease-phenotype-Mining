<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motor milestones and language development are delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals have some degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>Hypogonadism</z:hpo> is present in both males and females and manifests as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003241'>genital hypoplasia</z:hpo>, incomplete pubertal development, and, in most, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000789'>infertility</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>Short stature</z:hpo> is common; characteristic facial features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> are often present, and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> often occurs in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria are accurate, but the mainstay of diagnosis is DNA-based methylation testing to detect abnormal parent-specific imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) on chromosome 15; this testing determines whether the region is maternally inherited only (i. e., the paternally contributed region is absent) and detects more than 99% of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Methylation-specific testing is important to confirm the diagnosis of PWS in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals, but especially those who have atypical findings or are too young to manifest sufficient features to make the diagnosis on clinical grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: in infancy, special nipples or gavage feeding to assure adequate nutrition; physical therapy may improve muscle strength; hormonal and surgical treatments can be considered for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In childhood, strict supervision of daily food intake based on height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) to provide energy requirements while limiting <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (keeping BMI &lt;30) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Replacement of sex hormones at puberty produces adequate secondary sexual characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In adulthood, a group home for individuals with PWS that regulates behavior and weight management may prevent morbid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and growth hormone may help to maintain muscle bulk </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: PWS is caused by absence of the paternally derived PWS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> region of chromosome 15 by one of several genetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The risk to the sibs of an affected child of having PWS depends on the genetic mechanism that resulted in the absence of the paternally contributed PWS/AS region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The risk to sibs is less than 1% if the affected child has a deletion or <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, up to 50% if the affected child has a mutation of the imprinting control center, and up to 25% if a parental chromosomal translocation is present </plain></SENT>
