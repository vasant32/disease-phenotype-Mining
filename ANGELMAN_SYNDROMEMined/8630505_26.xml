<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The predominant genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 15q11-q13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, maternal deletions and paternal chromosome 15 UPD are associated with a different neurogenetic disorder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A few PWS-associated microdeletions involving a putative imprinting centre (IC) proximal to SNRPN have also been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have mapped the breakpoint of a balanced translocation (9;15)pat associated with most of the PWS features between SNRPN and IPWIPAR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methylation and expression studies indicate that the paternal SNRPN allele is unaffected by the translocation, while IPW and PAR1 are unexpressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This focuses the attention on genes distal to the breakpoint as the main candidate for PWS genes, and is consistent with a cis action of the putative IC, and suggests that further studies of translocational disruption of the imprinted region may establish genotype-phenotype relationships in this presumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
