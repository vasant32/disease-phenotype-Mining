<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution GTG- and GBG-banded chromosomes were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standard molecular analysis with six 15q11q13 DNA sequences was used to analyze copy number and parental origin of 15q11q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concordance between molecular and cytogenetic data was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined data showed that 23 of the 27 probands (85%) on whom we had definitive results have deletions of the chromosome 15q11q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two classes of deletion were detected molecularly: most patients were deleted for the 5 more proximal probes, but in 2 cases the deletion extended distally to include in sixth probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 13 cases where the parental origin of the deleted chromosome 15 could be established, it was maternal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cytological observations of the relative sizes of the heterochromatic regions of the short arm of chromosome 15 suggested that chromosomes with large heterochromatic blocks may be more prone to de novo deletion </plain></SENT>
