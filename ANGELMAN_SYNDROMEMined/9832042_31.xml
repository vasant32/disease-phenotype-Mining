<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present two unrelated subjects, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> G banding analysis, in whom 22q telomere deletions were serendipitously detected at two different institutions using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both probands presented with several of the previously described features associated with 22q deletions, including <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, and absence of speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our two cases increase the total number of reported 22q telomere deletions to 19, the majority of which were identified by cytogenetic banding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the limited sensitivity of routine cytogenetic studies (approximately 2-5 Mb), these two new cases suggest that the actual prevalence of 22q telomere deletions may be higher than currently documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of additional interest is the phenotypic overlap with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> as it raises the possibility of a 22q deletion in patients in whom AS has been ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of telomeric probes as diagnostic reagents would be useful in determining an accurate prevalence of chromosome 22q deletions and could result in a significantly higher detection rate of subtelomeric rearrangements </plain></SENT>
