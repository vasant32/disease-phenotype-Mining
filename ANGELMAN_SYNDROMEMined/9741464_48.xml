<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Duplications of chromosome region 15q11q13 often occur as a supernumerary chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Less frequently they occur as interstitial duplications [dup(15)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of three patients with de novo dup(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients, two males and one female (ages 3-21 years), had nonspecific findings that included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic behavior</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, and variable degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent, orientation, and parental origin of the duplications were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization, microsatellite analyses, and methylation status at D15S63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had large direct duplications of 15q11q13 [dir dup(15)(q11q13)] that extended through the entire <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>/Prader-Willi syndrome (AS/PWS) chromosomal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their proximal and distal breaks, at D15S541 or D15S9 and between D15S12 and D15S24, respectively, were comparable to those found in the common AS/PWS deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that duplications and deletions may be the reciprocal product of an unequal recombination event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These two duplications were maternally derived, but the origin of the chromatids involved in the unequal crossing over in meiosis differs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the duplication originated from two different maternal chromosomes, while in the other patient it arose from the same maternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The third patient had a much smaller duplication that involved only D15S11 and parental origin could not be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no obvious correlation between phenotype and extent of the duplication in these patients </plain></SENT>
