<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is a rapidly accumulating body of evidence from family, adoption and twin studies suggestive of a genetic component to many common <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In some cases, the transmission of abnormalities has been shown to be dependent upon the sex of the parent from whom they are inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Such 'parent-of-origin effects' may be explained by a number of genetic mechanisms, one of which is '<z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In imprinted genes one allele is silenced according to its parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This in turn means that imprinted traits are passed down the maternal or paternal line, in contrast to the more frequent Mendelian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> that is indifferent to the parental origin of the allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present review, we survey the evidence for the influence of imprinted genes on a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e>, ranging from explicit imprinted conditions, where in some cases abnormalities have been mapped to particular gene candidates, to examples where the evidence for parent-of-origin effects is less strong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also consider, briefly, the wider implications of imprinted effects on mental dysfunction, in particular with respect to evolutionary pressures on mammalian brain development and function </plain></SENT>
