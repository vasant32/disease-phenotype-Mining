<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a neurogenetic disorder caused by an expression defect of the maternally inherited copy of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene from chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the most common genetic defects include maternal deletions of chromosome 15q11-13, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> and imprinting defect, mutations in the UBE3A gene have been identified in approximately 10% of AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Chinese girl of 28 months presented clinical manifestation of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic diagnosis and molecular genetic defects were studied by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and linkage analysis by short tandem repeat (STR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further performed sequence analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the coding exons and flanking sequences of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The novel mutation screening was also performed in 100 unrelated healthy individuals to exclude the possibility of identifying a polymorphism variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MS-PCR analysis of the patient showed biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of chromosome 15 with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern in the 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And STR analysis revealed that the patient also inherited biparental alleles for six microsatellites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A novel mutation, cDNA1199 C&gt; A (p.P400H), in exon 9 of the maternal UBE3A gene, was identified in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the mutation was observed in the patient's mother who had a <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to perform the UBE3A gene mutation analysis in non-deletion/non-UPD/non-ID patients with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of the patient is concordant with that observed in previously reported AS patients with UBE3A mutation </plain></SENT>
