<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES/AIMS: To review seven children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> undergoing 16 general <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> for both invasive and noninvasive procedures to determine if these children are at greater risk for <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi>-related complications than the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Children with AS may exhibit unpredictable responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51373">GABA agonists</z:chebi> because of abnormal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormal receptors may affect AS patients' responses to sedation and general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study design was a retrospective chart review of seven patients with AS who underwent a total of 16 general <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> for a variety of invasive and noninvasive procedures between the years 4/25/2005 and 12/31/2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the preoperative orders, anesthesia record and PACU records for preoperative medication orders and intraoperative and PACU adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We could not find documentation of complications attributed to the delivery of general anesthesia regardless of chromosomal defect, the use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> activating drugs, or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients received a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-based <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> while 10 patients received potent inhalation agent for <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no statistical differences between the PACU lengths of stay (LOS) for AS patients as compared to the average PACU LOS for the 60 969 postprocedure patients cared for between 1/1/06 through 12/31/10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found no data to suggest that these patients demonstrate exaggerated responses to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> stimulating drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In fact, it appears that regardless of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agent</z:chebi>, the perioperative course was unremarkable </plain></SENT>
