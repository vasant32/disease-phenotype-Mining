<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> (LBW) is increased in subjects born after assisted reproduction technology (ART), and defective imprinting has frequently been identified in patients with Beckwith-Wiedermann and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> conceived by ART </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, we examined methylation pattern in a girl born after ART who had Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) which can be caused by maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for chromosome 7 and by hypomethylation of the differentially methylated region (DMR) of H19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined methylation status of 31 cytosines at the CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the DMR of PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e> on 7q32.2 and 23 cytosines at the CpG <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> in the DMR of H19 on 11p15, using leukocyte genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of the 31 cytosines in the patient and four of the 31 cytosines in the father were hypermethylated in the PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e>-DMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the H19-DMR, no abnormal methylation pattern was identified in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that hypermethylation of paternally expressed genes including PEG1/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MEST</z:e>, which usually have growth-promoting effects, may be relevant to LBW in subjects conceived by ART </plain></SENT>
