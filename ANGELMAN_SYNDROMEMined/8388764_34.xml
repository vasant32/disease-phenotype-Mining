<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The probe [locus] order extending distally from the centromere is 34[D15S9]-IR4-3R[D15S11]-189-1[D15S13]-PW71++ + [D15S63]-3-21[D15S10]-28 beta 3-H3[GABRB3]-IR10-1 [D15S12] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This order agrees with that recently reported (1) with the exception of PW71 [D15S63] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, a second <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (GABAA) receptor, the alpha 5 subunit, has been localized within the reference map to between GABRB3 and D15S12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The locus order was further confirmed by DNA hybridization analysis of two patients, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and one with Prader-Willi syndrome, with different unbalanced translocations and molecular extents of deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a framework map of chromosome 15q11-q13 into which additional markers can be oriented and allow a further differentiation of the critical genetic regions of the two syndromes </plain></SENT>
