<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4-Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11-q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a de novo frequency of approximately.67-1/10,000 births, these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events, we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analyses of rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, and FISH of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) at or near the breakpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The END-repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene (HERC2), many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of five PWS/AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process </plain></SENT>
