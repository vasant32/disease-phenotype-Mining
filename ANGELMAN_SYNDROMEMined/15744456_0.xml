<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PWS and AS patients with imprinting mutation have microdeletions, which share a 4.3 kb short region of overlap (SRO) at the 5' end of the paternal SNURF-SNRPN gene in PWS, or on the maternal allele, which shares a 880 bp SRO located at the 35 kb upstream of the SNURF-SNRPN promoter in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed an essential role of PWS-SRO in the postzygotic maintenance of the appropriate epigenotype on the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For AS-SRO, however, there is insufficient experimental evidence exists to determine the direct functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the complete deletion of AS-SRO does not cause any anomalies of imprinted gene expression or DNA methylation on the mutated human chromosome 15, further supporting the idea that AS-SRO is dispensable for post implantation imprint maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This implies that AS-SRO is not essential for the robust epigenotype preservation in somatic cells </plain></SENT>
