<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the first case of a child with a balanced 15;15 translocation and AS in whom molecular studies were crucial in confirming a diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DNA polymorphisms demonstrated paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> for chromosome 15, consistent with the diagnosis of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular studies also showed the patient to be homozygous at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci for which the father was heterozygous, suggesting that the structural rearrangement was an isochromosome 15q and not a Robertsonian translocation </plain></SENT>
