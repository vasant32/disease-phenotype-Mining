<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>YACs were isolated from two human genomic libraries by PCR and hybridization screening methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three sequence-tagged sites (STSs) were mapped within the contig, a density of approximately 1 per 200 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overlaps between YAC clones were identified by Alu-PCR dot-blot analysis and confirmed by STS mapping or hybridization with ends of YAC inserts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN), recently identified as a candidate gene for Prader-Willi syndrome, was localized within this contig between markers PW71 and TD3-21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loci mapped within and immediately flanking the Prader-Willi/Angelman chromosome region contig are ordered as follows: cen-IR39-ML34-IR4-3R-TD189-1-PW71-SNRPN -TD3-21- LS6-1-GABRB3,D15S97-GABRA5-IR10-1-CMW1+ ++-tel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This YAC contig will be a useful resource for more detailed physical mapping of the region, for generation of new DNA markers, and for mapping or cloning candidate genes for the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
