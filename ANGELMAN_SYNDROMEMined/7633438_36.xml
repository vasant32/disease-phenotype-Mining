<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is extensive evidence that recombination rate is influenced by chromatin conformation and that events are primarily initiated at gene promoter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to determine the pattern of chromatin condensation and recombination at meiosis in an imprinted region, fine scale genetic mapping in the approximately 4 Mb Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> deletion region was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the male-female recombination ratio can vary significantly over short regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A male recombination hotspot is localized to between the 3' end of GABRA5 and D15S156, which is adjacent to but outside the putative AS/PWS imprinted regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, a region of relatively high recombination in females is observed between D15S128 and D15S97, which spans a domain of paternal allele-specific transcription implicated in the Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is inferred that the inactivation and relative condensation of this latter region on the maternal chromosome occurs as a post-meiotic modification </plain></SENT>
