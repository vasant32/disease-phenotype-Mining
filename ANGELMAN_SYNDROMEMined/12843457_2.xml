<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To further our understanding of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> it will be essential to identify key control elements, and to investigate their regulation by both epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation) and trans-acting factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, sequence elements that regulate parental allele-specific gene expression have been identified in a number of imprinted loci, either because of their differential DNA methylation or through functional studies in transgenic mice (1,2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A systematic search for allele-specific chromatin features constitutes an alternative strategy to identify elements that regulate imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The validity of such an in vivo chromatin approach derives from the fact that in several known imprinting control-elements, a specialized organization of chromatin characterized by nuclease hypersensitivity is present on only one of the two parental chromosome (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, the differentially methylated 5 -portion of the human SNRPN gene-a sequence element that controls imprinting in the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>' domain on chromosome 15q11- q13-has strong DNase-I hypersensitive sites on the unmethylated paternal chromosome (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A differentially methylated region that regulates the imprinting of H19 and that of the neighboring insulin-like growth factor-2 gene on mouse chromosome 7 was also found to have parental chromosome-specific hypersensitive sites (5,6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The precise nature of the allelic nuclease hypersensitivity in these and other imprinted loci remains to be determined in more detail, for example, by applying complementary chromatin methodologies (7,8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it is commonly observed that a nuclease hypersensitive site corresponds to a small region where nucleosomes are absent or partially disrupted </plain></SENT>
