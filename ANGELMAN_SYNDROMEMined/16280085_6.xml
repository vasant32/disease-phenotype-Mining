<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PWS and AS) patients typically have an approximately 5 Mb deletion of human chromosome 15q11-q13, of opposite parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mouse model of PWS and AS has a transgenic insertion-deletion (TgPWS/TgAS) of chromosome 7B/C subsequent to paternal or maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we define the deletion endpoints and examine the impact on expression of flanking genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using molecular and cytological methods we demonstrate that 13 imprinted and 11 non-imprinted genes are included in the TgPWS/TgAS deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> expression levels were found in TgPWS brain for genes extending 9.1- or 5.6-Mb centromeric or telomeric of the deletion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our molecular cytological studies map the proximal deletion breakpoint between the Luzp2 and Siglec-H loci, and we show that overall <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of Luzp2 in TgPWS and TgAS brain are significantly reduced by 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, 5' Chrna7 shows 1.7-fold decreased levels in TgPWS and TgAS brain whereas there is a &gt; or =15-fold increase in expression in neonatal liver and spleen of these mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By isolating a Chrna7-Tg fusion transcript from TgAS mice, we mapped the telomeric deletion breakpoint in Chrna7 intron 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Based on the extent of the deletion, TgPWS/TgAS mice are models for PWS/AS class I deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other than for the first gene promoters immediately outside the deletion, since genes extending 5.6-9.1 Mb away from each end of the deletion show <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression levels in TgPWS brain, this indicates that the transgene array does not induce silencing and there are no additional linked rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using gene expression, non-coding conserved sequence (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="17141">NCCS</z:chebi>) and synteny data, we have genetically mapped a putative Luzp2 neuronal enhancer responsible for approximately 33% of allelic transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Chrna7 results are explained by hypothesizing loss of an essential neuronal transcriptional enhancer required for approximately 80% of allelic Chrna7 promoter activity, while the Chrna7 promoter is upregulated in B lymphocytes by the transgene immunoglobulin enhancer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mapping of a putative Chrna7 neuronal enhancer inside the deletion has significant implications for understanding the transcriptional regulation of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>-susceptibility candidate gene </plain></SENT>
