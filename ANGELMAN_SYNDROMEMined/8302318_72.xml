<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Type II (tyrosinase-positive) oculocutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> disorder that has recently been mapped to chromosome segment 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of this disorder is greatly increased in patients with Prader-Willi or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, both of which involve deletions of chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The P protein is a transmembrane <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> that may transport small molecules such as tyrosine, the precursor of melanin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The P gene is located in chromosome segment 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the tyrosinase and P genes in three patients with type II oculocutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo>, one of whom also had Prader-Willi syndrome, and in one patient with a milder syndrome known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001107'>ocular albinism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Individual exons of these genes were amplified from the DNA of each patient by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by simultaneous analyses of single-stranded conformation polymorphisms and heteroduplexes and subsequent DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutations of the P gene were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These included one frame shift, three missense mutations that result in amino acid substitutions, and one mutation that affects <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient with Prader-Willi syndrome plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> had a typical deletion of the paternal chromosome 15, rendering him hemizygous for a maternally inherited mutant allele of the P gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001107'>ocular albinism</z:hpo> was heterozygous for two different mutations in the P gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the P gene are associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, including type II oculocutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome, and at least some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001107'>ocular albinism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
