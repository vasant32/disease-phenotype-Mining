<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation plays a role in the control of imprinted gene expression, but so far only a few 5'-CG-3' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> within the recognition sites of the methylation sensitive enzymes have been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As part of a study on DNA methylation patterns in the human genome, we have applied the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> protocol of genomic sequencing to study <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5'-CG-3' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> around exon 1 of SNRPN and at the D15S63 locus, which contains a start site for alternative SNRPN transcripts possibly involved in imprint switching during gametogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 17 PCR products derived from single chromosomes of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals as well as PWS and AS patients have been sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> residues outside 5'-CG-3' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> are always unmethylated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, &gt; 96% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 23 5'-CG-3' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi> around SNRPN exon 1 are methylated on the maternal chromosome and completely devoid of methylation on the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding is in contrast to the D15S63 locus, where only the two Cfol/Hhal sites are methylated on the maternal chromosome at the same frequency as seen for the SNRPN segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the other five 5'-CG-3' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotides</z:chebi>, differential methylation is less pronounced, i.e. 45-70% on the maternal chromosome and 5-14% on the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences between SNRPN and D15S63 methylation may reflect different biological functions of the alternative SNRPN transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The systematic investigation of 5'-CG-3' methylation patterns as reported here will provide the basis for a PCR-based methylation test to diagnose PWS and AS </plain></SENT>
