<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IC/ SNRPN transcripts are initiated at two alternative start sites, which share a high degree of sequence similarity with each other and with two newly identified sites 63 and &gt;700 kb further upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of these sites are hypermethylated on the maternal chromosome, whereas one displays an oppositemethylation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also identified novel splice variants of the IC/ SNRPN transcripts and hitherto undetected exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of these exons, which we designate u5, is deleted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Angelman syndromepatients with a microdeletion of the IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that elements of the IC region have undergone multiple duplication events and that u5 or a sequence close by may play a role in <z:mp ids='MP_0003122'>maternal imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
