<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a rare congenital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> with complex genetic aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis may be difficult and there is severe life-long disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An AS clinic was commenced in Sydney, Australia, in 1993 with the aim of gathering information about the natural history of AS, management issues and parental concerns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Patients were referred from metropolitan Sydney, rural New South Wales and interstate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire, history, physical examination and diagnostic tests were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first year, 24 patients with AS were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 11 males and 13 females, whose ages ranged from 3 to 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age of diagnosis was 12.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by neurologists in four cases, by clinical geneticists in three cases, by paediatricians in two cases and 15 cases were diagnosed at the AS clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A clear history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was obtained in 19 (79%) and in 15 of these patients the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was during the first 4 years of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An EEG had been performed in 21 patients, and in two the EEG was reported as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the patients (62.5%) could walk independently and in this cohort there was a significant sex difference in walking: 10/11 males compared to 5/13 females (P &gt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five patients (21%) were in full-time permanent care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing with appropriate DNA probes from chromosome 15 (q11-13), complete in 20 families, showed deletion in 12 patients (60%),<z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> in 1(5%) and no detectable abnormality in 7 (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of AS should be considered in any patient with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disability</z:e> particularly if there is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> and lack of speech </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is a major management problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to establish the frequency and type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, the response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> and to determine if improvement can be expected with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mobility of patients should be assessed regularly, to determine the most appropriate options for intervention </plain></SENT>
