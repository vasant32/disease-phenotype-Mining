<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MeCP2 is a nuclear protein that binds specifically to methylated DNA and functions as a general transcription repressor in the context of chromatin remodeling complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RS shares clinical features with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, an imprinting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In AS patients, the maternally expressed copy of UBE3A that codes for the ubiquitin protein ligase 3A (E6-AP) is repressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The similar phenotype of these two syndromes led us to hypothesize that part of the RS phenotype is due to MeCP2-associated silencing of UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, UBE3A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein are shown here to be significantly reduced in human and mouse MECP2 deficient brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This reduced UBE3A level was associated with biallelic production of the UBE3A antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, MeCP2 deficiency resulted in elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 acetylation and H3(K4) methylation and reduced H3(K9) methylation at the PWS/AS imprinting center, with no effect on DNA methylation or SNRPN expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude, therefore, that MeCP2 deficiency causes epigenetic aberrations at the PWS imprinting center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> modifications result in loss of imprinting of the UBE3A antisense gene in the brain, increase in UBE3A antisense <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> level and, consequently reduction in UBE3A production </plain></SENT>
