<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The term "imprinted gene" refers to genes whose expression is conditioned by their parental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among theories to unravel the evolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, the kinship theory prevails as the most widely accepted, because it sheds light on many aspects of the biology of imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While most assumptions underlying this theory have not escaped scrutiny, one remains overlooked: mothers are the only source of parental investment in mammals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>But, is it reasonable to assume that fathers' contribution of resources is negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is not in some key mammalian orders including humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this research, I generalize the kinship theory of <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> beyond maternal contribution only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to deriving new conditions for the evolution of imprinting, I have found that the same gene may show the opposite pattern of expression when the investment of one parent relative to the investment of the other changes; the reversion, interestingly, does not require that fathers contribute more resources than mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This exciting outcome underscores the intimate connection between the kinship theory and the social structure of the organism considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the insight gained from my model enabled me to explain the clinical phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This syndrome is caused by the paternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of a deletion of the PWS/AS cluster of imprinted genes in human Chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As such, children suffering from this syndrome exhibit a striking biphasic phenotype characterized by poor sucking and <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> before weaning but by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002591'>voracious appetite</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> after weaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interest in providing an evolutionary explanation to such phenotype is 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the one hand, the kinship theory has been doubted as being able to explain the symptoms of patients with Prader-Willi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the post-weaning symptoms remain as one of the primary concern of pediatricians treating children with Prader-Willi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this research, I reconcile the clinical phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome with the kinship theory, contending that paternal investment relative to maternal investment increases after weaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>I also propose a genetic composition of the PWS/AS cluster, discuss the effects of new types of mutations, and contemplate the potential side effects of reactivating silent genes for medical purposes </plain></SENT>
