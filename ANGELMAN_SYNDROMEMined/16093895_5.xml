<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The notched delta pattern is one of the characteristic EEG features found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using the notched delta pattern as a detection tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients by analyzing its frequency in a tertiary care pediatric center, its specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and the age at which it was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors performed a retrospective review of the video-EEG recordings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients who had either the notched delta pattern or a phenotype consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The notched delta was observed in 1.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the EEGs performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its specificity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> was evaluated at 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The youngest age at which it was noted was 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the notched delta pattern is relatively rare, but more frequent than expected, and is easily recognizable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern was observed not only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients, but also in children with a spectrum of conditions wider than reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is a powerful detection tool for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> when correlated to a suggestive phenotype, and the association of these features should raise suspicion for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> in both infants and adults </plain></SENT>
