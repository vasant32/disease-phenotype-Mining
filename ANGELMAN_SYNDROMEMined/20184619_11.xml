<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The TCF4 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor which belongs to the family of E-proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>E-proteins form homo- and heterodimers with other members of the HLH family and bind to the common DNA sequence called E-box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene has been found to be associated with the Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PTHS is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000154'>wide mouth</z:hpo> plus other distinctive facial features (<z:mp ids='MP_0003774'>fleshy lips</z:mp>, beaked nose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000431'>broad nasal bridge</z:hpo>) and breathing abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of some phenotypical overlap with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, it has been suggested that PTHS be considered in its differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To explore this possibility, we screened 86 patients who were suspected of having AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were negative for UBE3A testing, and 53 were known to be negative for methylation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified two TCF4 mutations in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The p.S384Tfsx7 mutation lacks the bHLH domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The p.R582P mutation lies within the bHLH domain in which seven other missense mutations have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both mutations most likely affect the critical function of the bHLH domain of the TCF4 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found two TCF4 mutations in 86 patients (2%) suspected to have AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Screening for mutations in this gene should be considered in patients who present with findings of AS but who have been negative for methylation and UBE3A testing </plain></SENT>
