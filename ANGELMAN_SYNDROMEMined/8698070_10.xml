<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A receptor mapping technique using <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 iomazenil and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography (SPET) was employed to examine <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor binding in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000748'>inappropriate laughter</z:hpo> and ataxic movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this entity there is a cytogenic deletion of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15q11-q13, where the gene encoding the GABAA receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3) is located </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor is constructed as a receptor-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24869">ionophore</z:chebi> complex that contains the GABAA receptor, it is a suitable marker for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>-ergic synapsis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine whether <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor density, which indirectly indicates changes in GABAA receptor density, is altered in the brain in patients with AS, we investigated a 27-year-old woman with AS using 123I-iomazenil and SPET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Receptor density was quantitatively assessed by measuring the binding potential using a simplified method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was also measured with N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptor density is severely decreased in the cerebellum, and mildly decreased in the frontal and temporal cortices and basal ganglia, a result which is considered to indicate decreased GABAA receptor density in these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the deletion of GABRB3 was not observed in the present study, we indirectly demonstrated the disturbance of inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by the GABAA receptor in the investigated patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>123I-iomazenil with SPET was useful to map <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors, which indicate GABAA receptor distribution and their density </plain></SENT>
