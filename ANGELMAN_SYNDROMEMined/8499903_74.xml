<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further study the molecular mechanisms involved in these disorders and to improve molecular diagnostic methods, we have isolated three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat markers in the PWS/AS critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An Alu-CA PCR method was used to isolate CA-repeat markers directly from yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones identified by probes IR4-3R (D15S11), LS6-1 (D15S113), and GABAA receptor B3 (GABRB3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three markers with 6-11 alleles and 73-83% heterozygosities were identified and analyzed by multiplex PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene-centromere mapping was performed on a panel of ovarian <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratomas</z:hpo> of known meiotic origin, and showed the most proximal marker, IR4-3R, to be 13 cM (95% confidence limits: 7-19 cM) from the centromere of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Molecular diagnostic studies were performed on 20 PWS and 9 AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients with deletions, the parental origin of deletion was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten PWS patients were shown to have maternal heterodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since these markers are only 13 cM from the centromere, heterodisomy indicates that maternal meiosis I nondisjunction is involved in the origin of UPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two paternal disomy cases of AS showed isodisomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markers tested along the length of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests a paternal meiosis II nondisjunction event (without crossing over) or, more likely, monosomic conception (due to maternal nondisjunction) followed by chromosome duplication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
