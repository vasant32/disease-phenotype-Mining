<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study its effect on copy number variation (CNV), known to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire comprises the largest human gene family, it was selected for this study, which was carried out within and between three populations, derived from 150 individuals from the 1000 Genome Project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 3872 CNVs detected among 791 OR loci, in which 307 loci showed CNV, revealed the following novel findings: Sex bias in CNV was significantly more prevalent in uncommon than common CNV variants of OR pseudogenes, in which the male genome showed more CNVs; and in one-copy number loss compared to complete deletion of OR pseudogenes; both findings implying a more recent evolutionary role for gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex bias in copy number gain was also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another novel finding was that the observed sex bias was largely dependent on ethnicity and was in general absent in East Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using a CNV public database for sick children (International Standard Cytogenomic Array Consortium) the application of these findings for improving clinical molecular diagnostics is discussed by showing an example of sex bias in CNV among kids with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional clinical relevance is discussed, as the most polymorphic CNV-enriched OR cluster in the human genome, located on chr 15q11.2, is found near the Prader-Willi syndrome/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> bi-directionally imprinted region associated with two well-known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As olfaction represents the primitive cognition in most mammals, arguably in competition with the development of a larger brain, the extensive retention of OR pseudogenes in females of this study, might point to a parent-of-origin indirect regulatory role for OR pseudogenes in the embryonic development of human brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus any perturbation in the temporal regulation of olfactory system could lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> disorders including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
