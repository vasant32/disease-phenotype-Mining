<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have evaluated fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for the clinical laboratory detection of the 15q11-q13 deletion seen in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> using probes for loci D15S11, SNRPN, D15S10, and GABRB3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a series of 118 samples from patients referred for PWS or AS, 29 had deletions by FISH analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included two brothers with a paternally transmitted deletion detectable with the probe for SNRPN only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-banding analysis was less sensitive for deletion detection but useful in demonstrating other cytogenetic alterations in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Methylation and CA-repeat analyses of 15q11-q13 were used to validate the FISH results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings of patients with deletions were variable, ranging from newborns with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> as the only presenting feature to children who were classically affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that FISH analysis is a rapid and reliable method for detection of deletions within 15q11-q13 and whenever a deletion is found, FISH analysis of parental chromosomes should also be considered </plain></SENT>
