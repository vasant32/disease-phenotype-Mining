<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>Hypopigmentation</z:hpo> has been identified in the Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined 6 individuals with AS to further characterize the pigment pattern in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age of the 5 girls and one boy ranged from 2.4 to 7.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None had obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001022'>albinism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hair color ranged from light blond to brown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin was type I in 3 and type II in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eye changes included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> in 2, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> in 4, and reduced <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean hairbulb tyrosinase activity was 0.37 +/- 0.44 pmol/hb/120 min for the individuals with AS, with a range of 0.00 to 1.13 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brown control 1.49 +/- 0.79, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blond control 1.50 +/- 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic examination of hairbulb melanocytes showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> melanosome and melanocyte architecture and number, but reduced melanin formation, with many stage II and III premelanosomes but few stage IV fully melanized melanosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>Hypopigmentation</z:hpo> characterized by light skin, reduced <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment, low hairbulb tyrosinase activity, and incomplete melanization of melanosomes is part of the phenotype of AS, and is similar to that found in PWS </plain></SENT>
