<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the "classic" features of AS are well described, few large-scale studies have delineated the clinical features in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present baseline data from 92 children with a molecular diagnosis of AS between 5 and 60 months old who are enrolled in the National Institutes of Health <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rare Diseases</z:e> Clinical Research Network <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> Natural History Study from January 2006 to March 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent of participants had deletions, 14% had either <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) or imprinting defects, and 12% had UBE3A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants with UPD/imprinting defects were heavier (P = 0.0002), while those with deletions were lighter, than the general population (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty out of 92 participants were underweight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had deletions or UBE3A mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight out of 92 participants (6/13 (46%) with UPD/imprinting defects and 2/11 (18%) with UBE3A mutations) were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four out of 92 participants (80%) had absolute or relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No participant was macrocephalic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common behavioral findings were mouthing behavior (95%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000736'>short attention span</z:hpo> (92%), ataxic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002136'>broad-based gait</z:hpo> (88%), history of sleep difficulties (80%), and fascination with water (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Frequent, easily provoked laughter was observed in 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were reported in 65% of participants but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> electroencephalograms (EEGs) were abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the most characteristic feature of AS is the neurobehavioral phenotype, but specific EEG findings are highly sensitive for AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> is common among those with UPD/imprinting defects </plain></SENT>
