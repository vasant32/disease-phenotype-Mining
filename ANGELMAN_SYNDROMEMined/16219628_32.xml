<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that IVF and assisted reproduction technologies (ART) may result in abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, leading to an increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> and Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome (BWS) in IVF children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To learn how ART might alter the epigenome, we examined morulas and blastocysts derived from C57BL/6J X M. spretus F1 mice conceived in vivo and in vitro and determined the allelic expression of four imprinted genes: Igf2, H19, Cdkn1c and Slc221L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IVF-derived mouse embryos that were cultured in human tubal fluid (HTF) (Quinn's advantage) media displayed a high frequency of aberrant H19 imprinting, whereas in vivo and IVF embryos showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maternal expression of Cdkn1c and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biallelic expression of Igf2 and Slc221L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from IVF blastocysts also showed abnormal Igf2/H19 imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allele-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulphite</z:chebi> PCR reveals <z:mp ids='MP_0008877'>abnormal DNA methylation</z:mp> at a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) site in the imprinting control region (ICR), as the normally unmethylated maternal allele acquired a paternal methylation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate an increase of lysine 4 methylation (dimethyl Lys4-H3) on the paternal chromatin and a gain in lysine 9 methylation (trimethyl Lys9-H3) on the maternal chromatin at the same CTCF-binding site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that de novo DNA methylation on the maternal allele and allele-specific acquisition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation lead to aberrant Igf2/H19 imprinting in IVF-derived ES cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that ART, which includes IVF and various culture media, might cause imprinting errors that involve both aberrant DNA methylation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> methylation at an epigenetic switch of the Igf2-H19 gene region </plain></SENT>
