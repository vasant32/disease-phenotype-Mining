<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and traditional cytogenetic techniques, and to explore the clinical application of these techniques in delineating de novo marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> patient received chromosome test by ordinary G banding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CGH and FISH techniques were used to analyze the origin of the de novo SMC, and N banding technique and C banding techniques were used to analyze the SMC structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic effects of the SMC were analyzed after the karyotype was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By G banding technique, the patient was showed to have a mosaic karyotype with SMC: mos.47, XX, +mar [31]/48, XX, +2mar[29] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CGH analysis showed a gain of 15q11 --&gt; q14, and the result was confirmed by FISH with chromosome 15 painting probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The further FISH analysis showed the SMC had two signals with UBE3A probe for detecting Prader-willi syndrome/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PWS/AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>N banding and C banding analysis showed the SMC had a double satellite and double centromere, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined with the above results, the karyotype of the patient was: mos.47, XX, +der (15) (pter --&gt; q14::q14 --&gt; pter) [31]/48, XX, +2der (15) (pter --&gt; q14::q14 --&gt; pter) [29]. ish der(15)(WCP15+, UBE3A++, PML-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CGH is a valuable method to detect imbalanced chromosomal rearrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined with FISH and the traditional cytogenetic technique, it provides a valuable technique platform for characterizing the structure of the de novo SMC, and a basis for exploring the relation between karyotype and phenotype, prognosis and recurrent risk </plain></SENT>
