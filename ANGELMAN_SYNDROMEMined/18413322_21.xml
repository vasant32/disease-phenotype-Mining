<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases of AS are caused by mutations which disrupt expression of maternal UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although some progress has been made in understanding hippocampal-related memory and learning aspects of the disorder using Ube3a deficient mice, the numerous motoric abnormalities associated with AS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002345'>action tremor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>sialorrhea</z:hpo> and excessive chewing/mouthing behaviors) have not been fully explored with mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we use a novel quantifiable analysis of fluid consumption and licking behavior along with a battery of motor tests to examine cerebellar and other motor system defects in Ube3a deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice with a maternally inherited Ube3a deficiency (Ube3a(m-/p+)) show defects in fluid consumption behavior which are different from Ube3a(m-/p-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rhythm of fluid licking and number of licks per visit were significantly different among the three groups (m-/p-, m-/p+, m+/p+) and indicate that not only was fluid consumption dependent on Ube3a expression in the cerebellum, but may also depend on low levels of Ube3a expression in other brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional neurological testing revealed defects in both Ube3a(m-/p+) and Ube3a(m-/p-) mice in rope climbing, grip strength, gait and a raised-beam task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term observation of fluid consumption behavior is the first phenotype reported that differentiates between mice with a maternal loss of function versus complete loss of Ube3a in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying mouse fluid consumption defects specifically associated with maternally inherited Ube3a deficiency may reveal important new insights into the pathobiology of AS in humans </plain></SENT>
