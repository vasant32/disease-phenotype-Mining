<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the variability of smiling and laughing behaviors of 3 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> was examined across typical social contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that laughing and smiling increased during social situations and occurred at low levels during non-social situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The behaviors, therefore, did not occur totally inappropriately, as has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings illustrate the need to divert attention to the examination of environmental influences on purported phenotypic behavior in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0567439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
