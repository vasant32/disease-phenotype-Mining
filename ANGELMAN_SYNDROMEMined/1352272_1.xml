<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe two female siblings with similar clinical features consisting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000268'>scaphocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, mongoloid eye slant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000581'>blepharophimosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, supernumerary mouth frenula and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Routine cytogenetic studies in the elder patient did not reveal any abnormality, and initially it was assumed that the syndrome had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a slightly larger chromosome 13 was seen in routine G-banded metaphases of the mother and the youngest of the two siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A shorter chromosome 15 was detected in the mother only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High resolution banding showed that the abnormal chromosome 13 contained an extra G-positive band at 13q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The short chromosome 15 in the mother appeared to have a deletion of band q12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization using DNA markers specific to chromosomes 13 and 15 unequivocally showed that the mother was a carrier of a balanced reciprocal translocation t(13;15)(q12;q13), whereas the youngest sibling's karyotype was 46,XX,-13,+der(15)t(13;15)(q12;q13)mat, resulting in partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 13pter----q12 and partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 15pter----q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proband is thus trisomic for the critical region responsible for Prader-Willi syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>; this was confirmed by DNA analysis demonstrating one paternal and two maternal alleles from multiallelic marker loci mapping to 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This report illustrates the sensitivity and specificity offered by fluorescence in situ hybridization and its usefulness in the diagnosis and delineation of subtle chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
