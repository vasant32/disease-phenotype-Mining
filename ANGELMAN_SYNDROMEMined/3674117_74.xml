<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a number of other clinical entities have also been associated with similar, if not identical, cytogenetic defects, arguing for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> associated with abnormalities in this region of chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 3 patients who <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> appear to have deletions in 15q11-15q12, such as described for many patients with Prader-Willi syndrome; however, none of these patients has classical clinical features of the Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient is a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams syndrome</z:e>, the second, Angelman (Happy Puppet) syndrome, and the third is a child with <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> of infancy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, but who does not meet specific diagnostic criteria for the Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that different molecular abnormalities involving specific points or segments along the long arm of chromosome 15 might account for the clinical diversity seen among these and other patients </plain></SENT>
