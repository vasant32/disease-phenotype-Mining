<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present our analysis of eight such unbalanced translocations that, depending on the parental origin of the rearranged chromosome, were associated with either Prader-Willi or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, using FISH with specific BAC clones, we characterized the chromosome 15 breakpoint of each translocation and demonstrate that four of them are clustered in a small 460 kb interval located in the proximal 15q14 band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Second, analyzing the sequence of this region, we demonstrate the proximity of a low-copy repeat 15 (LCR15)-duplicon element that is known to facilitate recombination events at meiosis and to promote rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence, in this region, of both a cluster of translocation breakpoints and a LCR15-duplicon element defines a new breakpoint cluster (BP6), which, to our knowledge, is the most distal breakpoint cluster described in proximal 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Third, we demonstrate that the breakpoints for other rearrangements including large inv dup (15) chromosomes do not map to BP6, suggesting that it is specific to translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, the translocation breakpoints located within BP6 result in very large proximal 15q deletions providing new informative genotype-phenotype correlations </plain></SENT>
