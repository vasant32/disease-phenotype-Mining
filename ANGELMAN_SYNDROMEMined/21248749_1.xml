<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several individuals with deletions flanked by BP3 and BP4 on 15q13, immediately distal to, and not including the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (PW/AS) critical region and proximal to the BP4-BP5 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region, have been reported; however, because the deletion has also been found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relatives, the significance of these alterations is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified six individuals with deletions limited to the BP3-BP4 interval and an additional four individuals with deletions of the BP3-BP5 interval from 34â€‰046 samples submitted for clinical testing by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of four individuals with BP3-BP4 deletions for whom parental testing was conducted, two were apparently de novo and two were maternally inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparison of clinical features, available for five individuals in our study (four with deletions within BP3-BP4 and one with a BP3-BP5 deletion), with those in the literature show common features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp>, and premature breast development in some individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the BP3-BP4 deletion does not yet demonstrate statistically significant enrichment in abnormal populations compared with control populations, the presence of common clinical features among probands and the presence of genes with roles in development and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system function in the deletion region suggest that this deletion may have a role in abnormal phenotypes in some individuals </plain></SENT>
