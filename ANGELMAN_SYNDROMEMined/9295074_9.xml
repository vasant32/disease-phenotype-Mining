<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amniocentesis was performed on a 36-year-old woman at 16.5 weeks of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis documented a 45,XX,der(15;15) (q10;q10) chromosome pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No evidence of a deletion was observed by FISH using a SNRPN DNA probe associated with the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies in the family using six polymorphic markers for chromosome 15 and Southern blot analysis of DNA methylation for the CpG island near the SNRPN gene showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of chromosome 15, excluding <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was counseled that her child would not be able to bear off-spring without clinical assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Otherwise the health and intellect of her child were not expected to be affected by the translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We consider this to be the first prenatal case identified with a balanced der(15;15)(q10;q10) Robertsonian translocation and a phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> female outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prenatally identified cases of der(15;15)(q10;q10) warrant further investigation by molecular methodology </plain></SENT>
