<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with an imprinting defect have apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 15 of biparental origin, but are recognised by @parental DNA methylation at D15S63 (PW71) or SNURF-SNRPN exon 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the methylation status of five additional loci in 12 such patients with or without a deletion in the imprinting centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each patient, the imprinting defect affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During routine diagnostic testing we identified four patients who had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> methylation pattern at SNURF-SNRPN exon 1, but an abnormal pattern at D15S63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two of these patients, who were suspected of having PWS, this change was restricted to D15S63 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients suspected of having AS, several but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a newly developed methylation-specific PCR test for D15S63 we found that these methylation changes are rare in patients suspected of having AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although we can not prove that the methylation changes in the four patients are causally related to their disease, our findings demonstrate that spatially restricted changes in methylation can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In some cases, these changes may reflect incomplete imprint spreading </plain></SENT>
