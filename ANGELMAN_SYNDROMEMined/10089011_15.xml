<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous reports of individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> with maternal duplications of 15q11-q13, the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region, suggest this area as a source of candidate genes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maternal truncation mutations in UBE3A, which encodes for E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase, have been shown to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, which can also result from the absence of maternal chromosomal material from this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite showing no evidence for imprinting in other tissues, this gene was recently discovered to be preferentially maternally expressed in human brain and expressed solely from the murine maternal chromosome in the hippocampus and cerebellar Purkinje cells, regions implicated in the neuropathology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on this evidence, the coding region and a putative promoter region were sequenced in ten autistic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several polymorphisms were detected, but no evidence was found for a functional mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence for likely altered regulation of UBE3A expression in maternal 15q11-q13 duplications suggests further investigation of the regulatory regions of this gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
