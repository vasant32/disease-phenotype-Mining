<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these defects may be due to abnormal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> levels in different regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ube3a, a gene that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> when maternally deleted and is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> when maternally duplicated has recently been shown to regulate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> synthesis in the Drosophila brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> levels in striatum, ventral midbrain, frontal cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex and hippocampus in Ube3a deficient and Ube3a duplication animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>), a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> affected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, was elevated in the striatum and cortex of AS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">Dopamine</z:chebi> levels were almost uniformly elevated compared to control littermates in the striatum, midbrain and frontal cortex regardless of genotype in Ube3a deficient and Ube3a duplication animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the duplication 15q <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> mouse model, paternal but not maternal duplication animals showed a decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> levels when compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermates, in accordance with previously published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, maternal duplication animals show no significant changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> levels throughout the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These abnormal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> levels could be responsible for many of the behavioral abnormalities observed in both AS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, but further investigation is required to determine if any of these changes are purely dependent on Ube3a levels in the brain </plain></SENT>
