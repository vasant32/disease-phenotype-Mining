<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From this region we have identified novel transcripts, which represent alternative transcripts of the SNRPN gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The novel exons lack protein coding potential and are expressed from the paternal chromosome only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also identified intragenic deletions and a point mutation in patients who have Angelman or Prader-Willi syndrome due to a parental imprint switch failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that imprint switching on human chromosome 15 may involve alternative SNRPN transcripts </plain></SENT>
