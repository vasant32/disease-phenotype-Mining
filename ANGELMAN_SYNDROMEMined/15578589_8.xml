<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study compared behavioral characteristics of 62 individuals with genetically confirmed AS and 29 individuals with presumed AS from clinical features, with a control group of young persons with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> (ID) derived from an Australian epidemiological register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve behavioral items from the developmental behavior checklist (DBC) were used for this comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The groups were matched for chronological age, gender, and level of ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the AS group, significant differences were found for 10 behaviors, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000736'>poor attention span</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100710'>impulsivity</z:hpo> being less common, and overactivity/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, chewing or mouthing objects, eating non-food items, gorging food, food fads, fascination for water, hand flapping and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> being more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, there was no difference in prevalence of unprovoked laughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the results of the genetically confirmed with the genetically unconfirmed AS cases showed no significant differences between individual behavior prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that a "behavioral phenotype" of AS can be distinguished from others of similar level of ID, but it is different from that hitherto published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal food related behaviors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, fascination for water, hand flapping, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbance</z:hpo> should be included in a "behavioral phenotype" for AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Apart from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo>, "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ADHD</z:e>-type" behaviors are not more characteristic of AS than in ID generally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the Consensus Criteria for the diagnosis of AS need to be reviewed </plain></SENT>
