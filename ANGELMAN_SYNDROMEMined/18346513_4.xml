<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We performed [(11)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) and examined <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor expression in 7 patients with AS of various genotypes (5 with the deletion, 1 with an imprinting defect [ID], and 1 with a UBE3A mutation) and 4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Relative to the control subjects, the [(11)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> binding potentials (BPs) were significantly higher in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in the 5 patients with the deletion and in the 1 patient with a UBE3A mutation, and were less frequently or barely increased in adult patients with the deletion and in the patient with IDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor expression was increased in patients with AS with various genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a developmental dysregulation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor subunits occurs in patients with AS </plain></SENT>
