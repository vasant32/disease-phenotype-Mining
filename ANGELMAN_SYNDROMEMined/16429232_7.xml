<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The human chromosome 15q11-q13, or mouse chromosome 7C, is an imprinting domain controlled by bipartite imprinting centers (ICs): Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)-IC and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PWS-IC functions to maintain the paternal epigenotype on the paternal chromosome in somatic cells, while AS-IC plays a role in the establishment of the maternal epigenetic mark at PWS-IC in the female germline or early embryos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several alternative exons and promoters of Snurf-Snrpn (SNRPN upstream reading frame-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N) are expressed as "IC transcripts" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that IC-transcript expression is restricted to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied expression of the mouse IC-transcript in tissues including brain and oocytes as well as in cultured neurons and glia cells by RT-PCR and by in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) in oocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IC transcript was strongly expressed in brain (especially in neurons) and ovary (especially in oocytes and granulosa cells), while no expression was found in other tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed by quantitative analysis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Expression levels in the brain were 7-fold higher compared to those in ovaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e> signals were observed in oocytes and granulosa cells of the secondary and developing follicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with previous data, suggest that the IC transcript may be associated with the establishment of PWS-IC methylation on the maternal chromosome as an AS-IC cis-acting element </plain></SENT>
