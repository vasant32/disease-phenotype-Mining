<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case, a 26-year-old pregnant woman was referred for amniocenthesis and microdeletion Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing at 18 weeks of gestation due to history of a previous child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PWS/AS region deletion was excluded by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A de novo supernumerary, non-satellited, monocentric marker chromosome was detected during conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the use of FISH testing, it was found that the marker chromosome originated from chromosome 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the marker chromosome was found not to contain the Smith-Magenis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MDLS">Miller Dieker syndrome</z:e> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After detailed review of the literature, genetic counseling was given to the family, and the family decided to continue the pregnancy to term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A female child was born at term without any phenotypical abnormalities and clinical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 15 months-of-age revealed no developmental abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, our patient is the first reported prenatal case with a de novo monocentric, supernumerary marker chromosome derived from chromosome 17 in a non-mosaic form that resulting in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
