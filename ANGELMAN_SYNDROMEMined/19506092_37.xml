<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Copy-number variants (CNVs) are substantial contributors to human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A central challenge in CNV-disease association studies is to characterize the pathogenicity of rare and possibly incompletely penetrant events, which requires the accurate detection of rare CNVs in large numbers of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cost and throughput issues limit our ability to perform these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have adapted the Illumina BeadXpress SNP genotyping assay and developed an algorithm, SNP-Conditional OUTlier detection (SCOUT), to rapidly and accurately detect both rare and common CNVs in large cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This approach is customizable, cost effective, highly parallelized, and largely automated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We applied this method to screen 69 loci in 1105 children with unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, identifying pathogenic variants in 3.1% of these individuals and potentially pathogenic variants in an additional 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified seven individuals (0.7%) with a deletion of 16p11.2, which has been previously associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results widen the phenotypic spectrum of these deletions to include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also detected 1.65-3.4 Mbp duplications at 16p13.11 in 1.1% of affected individuals and 350 kbp deletions at 15q11.2, near the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region, in 0.8% of affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to published CNVs in controls they are significantly (P = 4.7 x 10(-5) and 0.003, respectively) enriched in these children, supporting previously published hypotheses that they are neurocognitive disease risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More generally, this approach offers a previously unavailable balance between customization, cost, and throughput for analysis of CNVs and should prove valuable for targeted CNV detection in both research and diagnostic settings </plain></SENT>
