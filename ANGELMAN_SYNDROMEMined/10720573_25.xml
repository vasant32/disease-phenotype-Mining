<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, a chromosome 15 duplicon was discovered in the common breakpoint regions of Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified previously the large HERC2 transcript as an ancestral gene in this duplicon, with approximately 11 HERC2-containing duplicons, and demonstrated that recessive mutations in mouse Herc2 lead to a developmental syndrome, juvenile development and fertility 2 (jdf2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have now constructed and sequenced a genomic contig of HERC2, revealing a total of 93 exons spanning approximately 250 kb and a CpG island promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A processed ribosomal protein L41 pseudogene occurs in intron 2 of HERC2, and putative VNTRs occur in intron 70 (28 copies, approximately 76-bp repeat) and 3' exon 40 through intron 40 (6 copies, approximately 62-bp repeat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparisons show that HERC2-containing duplicons have undergone several deletion, inversion, and dispersion events to form complex duplicons in 15q11, 15q13, and 16p11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To further understand the developmental role of HERC2, a highly conserved Drosophila ortholog was characterized, with 70% amino acid sequence identity to human HERC2 over the carboxy-terminal 743 residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Combined, these studies provide significant insights into the structure of complex duplicons and into the evolutionary pathways of formation, dispersal, and genomic instability of duplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results establish that some genes not only have a protein coding function but can also play a structural role in the genome </plain></SENT>
