<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to further our understanding of the epigenetic modifications of DNA and its role in imprinting, we examined DNA methylation patterns of human tissues of uniparental origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform moles</z:mpath> (CHM), which are totally androgenetic conceptions, to examine the paternal methylation pattern in the absence of a maternal contribution and we used ovarian <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratomas</z:hpo> to represent the maternal counterpart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We carried out an analysis of DNA methylation of a gene which has been shown to contain sites which are differentially methylated in a parent-specific fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The gene, ZNF127, is located on chromosome 15q11-q13 in the region associated with Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parent-of-origin DNA methylation has been postulated to reflect the presence of an imprint and recent studies have confirmed that ZNF127 is differentially expressed only from the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified a unique pattern of hyper- and hypomethylated sites in androgenetic conceptions which was nearly identical to the paternal pattern found in sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This may represent the paternal germ-line methylation imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also studied partial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_456'>hydatidiform moles</z:mpath>, non-molar triploid conceptions, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chorionic villi, and somatic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrated a modified DNA methylation pattern characteristic of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chorionic villi with only limited findings of the imprint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that human androgenetic conceptions may provide an excellent model to analyze epigenetic DNA modifications, such as methylation, in imprinted genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The paternal allele-specific methylation imprint will also be useful clinically to confirm the androgenetic nature of suspected molar conceptions in which parental blood samples may not be available </plain></SENT>
