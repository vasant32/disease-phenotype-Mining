<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution cytogenetic studies showed a deletion of the proximal chromosome 15q(q11-q13) region in approximately 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the same deletion was described in another distinct <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorder</z:e>: the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This deletion was confirmed by molecular analyses, and a new mechanism was reported: <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (maternal in PWS and paternal in AS) strongly implicate <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> in this chromosomal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The principal aim of our group is to apply cytogenetic and molecular biology techniques to perform diagnosis and genetic counselling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient studies were usually based on high resolution cytogenetic analysis, quantitative Southern blotting (with D15S9, D15S11, D15S10, D15S12 loci) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphism assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (IR4 .3R and GABARB3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combination of these different methods allowed us to propose a diagnostic strategy for PWS </plain></SENT>
