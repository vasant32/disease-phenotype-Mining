<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the general population, the syndrome occurs in about 1 in 20,000 live births and its prevalence in severely mentally retarded individuals is 1.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These figures, however, may be an underestimate, because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>variable phenotype</z:hpo> of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this work was to investigate AS patients among a group of mentally retarded subjects, using the methylation pattern of the SNRPN gene, as determined by Southern blotting molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecular investigation of 75 institutionalized individuals with severe to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002187'>profound mental retardation</z:hpo> resulted in the detection of 1 case with an abnormal methylation pattern of the SNRPN gene, corresponding to AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's phenotype was classified as atypical, without outbursts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000748'>inappropriate laughter</z:hpo> or a happy disposition; the patient would not have been diagnosed in the usual screens for AS, which only select patients who demonstrate the typical clinical findings characteristic of the disease </plain></SENT>
