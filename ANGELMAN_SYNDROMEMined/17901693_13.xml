<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many of these imbalances are caused by submicroscopic deletions or duplications not detected by conventional cytogenetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) is considered to be superior for the investigation of chromosomal aberrations in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>, and has been demonstrated to improve the diagnostic detection rate of these small chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we used 1 Mb genome-wide array-CGH to screen 48 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> for submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances, where the underlying cause was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children were clinically investigated and subtelomere FISH analysis had been performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suspected microdeletion syndromes such as deletion 22q11.2, Williams-Beuren and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> were excluded before array-CGH analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified de novo interstitial chromosomal imbalances in two patients (4%), and an interstitial deletion inherited from an affected mother in one patient (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In another two of the children (4%), suspected imbalances were detected but were also found in one of the non-affected parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The yield of identified de novo alterations detected in this study is somewhat less than previously described, and might reflect the importance of which selection criterion of patients to be used before array-CGH analysis is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, array-CGH proved to be a high-quality and reliable tool for genome-wide screening of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> patients of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
