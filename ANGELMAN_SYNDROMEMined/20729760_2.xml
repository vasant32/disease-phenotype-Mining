<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> with minimal speech and certain behavioral characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used standardized measures to characterize the developmental profile and to analyze genotype-phenotype correlations in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The study population consisted of 92 children, between 5 months and 5 years of age, enrolled in a Natural History Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each participant was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III), the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-four percent had a deletion and 26% had <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp>, an imprinting defect or a UBE3A mutation ("non-deletion") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean +/- standard deviation BSID-III cognitive scale developmental quotient (DQ) was 40.5 +/- 15.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Participants with deletions were more developmentally delayed than the non-deletion participants in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> BSID-III domains except in expressive language skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cognitive DQ was higher than the DQ in each of the other domains, and the receptive language DQ was higher than the expressive language DQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the [ corrected] VABS-II, deletion participants had weaker motor and language skills than the non-deletion participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Children with AS have a distinct developmental and behavioral profile; their cognitive skills are stronger than their language and motor skills, and their receptive language skills are stronger than expressive language skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Developmental outcomes are associated with genotype, with deletion patients having worse outcomes than non-deletion patients </plain></SENT>
