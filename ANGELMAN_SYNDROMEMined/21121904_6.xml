<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to utilize diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine alterations in white matter pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, with an emphasis on correlations with clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: DTI was used to examine the arcuate fasciculus (AF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), and the corpus callosum (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 14 children aged 8 to 17 years (mean age 10y 8mo; SD 2y 7mo) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (seven male; seven female) and 13 typically developing children, aged 8 to 17 years, for comparison (five male; eight female; mean age 12y; SD 2y 9mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were assessed using standardized measures of development, language, and behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> exhibited lower fractional anisotropy and increased radial diffusivity values than the comparison group for the AF, UF, ILF, and CC (p &lt; 0.006 corrected for multiple comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also had lower fractional anisotropy values for the IFOF and higher radial diffusivity values for the left IFOF (p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> had significantly higher apparent diffusion coefficient values in the AF, CC, ILF, and the left IFOF (p &lt; 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations were noted between DTI parameters and some of the clinical assessment outcomes (e.g. language, socialization, cognition) for three of the temporal pathways (AF, UF, ILF; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interpretation: Changes in DTI parameters in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> suggest decreased/delayed myelination, decreased axonal density or diameter, or aberrant axonal organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a generalized white matter alteration throughout the brain in those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>; however, only the alterations in temporal white matter pathways were associated with language and cognitive and social functioning </plain></SENT>
