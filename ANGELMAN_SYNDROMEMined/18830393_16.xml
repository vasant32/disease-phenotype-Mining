<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is due to lack of expression of the UBE3A gene, an imprinted gene located on chromosome 15q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we review the main features of this phenotype, characterized by happy demeanor with prominent smiling, poorly specific laughing and general exuberance, associated with hypermotor behavior, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000733'>stereotypies</z:hpo>, and reduced behavioral adaptive skills despite proactive social contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these phenotypic characteristics are currently difficult to quantify and have been subject to some differences in interpretation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many of these features may occur in other syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, but their combination, with particularly prominent laughter and smiling may be specific of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Management of problematic behaviors is primarily based on behavioral approaches, though psychoactive medication (eg, <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptics</z:chebi> or antidepressants) may be required </plain></SENT>
