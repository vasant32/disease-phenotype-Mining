<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In mice and humans, the locus encoding the gene for small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N (SNRPN/Snrpn), as well as other loci in the region are subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SNRPN promoter is embedded in a maternally methylated CpG island, is expressed only from the paternal chromosome and lies within an imprinting center that is required for switching to and/or maintenance of the paternal epigenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that a 0.9-kb deletion of exon 1 of mouse Snrpn did not disrupt imprinting or elicit any obvious phenotype, although it did allow the detection of previously unknown upstream exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a larger, overlapping 4.8-kb deletion caused a partial or mosaic imprinting defect and <z:mp ids='MP_0002081'>perinatal lethality</z:mp> when paternally inherited </plain></SENT>
