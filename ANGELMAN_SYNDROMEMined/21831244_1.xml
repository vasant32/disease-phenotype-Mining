<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo>, lack of speech, and low threshold for laughter; it is considered a 'syndromic' form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have indicated overlap of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> and AS, primarily in individuals with larger (∼6 Mb) Class I deletions of chromosome 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Questions remain regarding whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> solely contributes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> features in AS and how <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> features in AS change over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used a dimensional approach to examine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> symptom severity in individuals with AS Class I versus Class II deletions within the context of cognitive development over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 17 participants with a larger, Class I deletion and 25 participants with a smaller Class II deletion (∼5 Mb) were enrolled (age range = 2-25 years; 5 years 5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized measures of cognition, language, motor skills, adaptive skills, maladaptive behavior, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, and sensory-seeking behaviors/aversions were given at baseline and after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Despite equivalent cognition and adaptive behavior, the results of repeated measures analyses of variance indicate that participants with Class I deletions have greater impairment in social affect (F = 8.65; p = .006) and more repetitive behaviors (F = 7.92; p = .008) compared to participants with Class II deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although both groups improve in cognition over time, differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> behaviors persist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of differences in cognition or adaptive behavior, individuals with Class I deletions have greater severity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> features and sensory aversions that remain over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are four genes (NIPA 1, NIPA 2, CYFIP1, and GCP5) missing in Class I and present in Class Il deletions, one or more of which may have a role in modifying the severity of social affect impairment, and level of restricted/repetitive behaviors in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest the utility of a dimensional, longitudinal approach to the assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> features in populations of individuals who are low functioning </plain></SENT>
