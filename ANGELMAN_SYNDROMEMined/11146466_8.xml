<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most instances of maternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD) start as <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomies</z:mp> and, similar to the latter, show a significant increase of mean maternal age at delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the incidence of UPD in offspring of older mothers, we investigated two groups of patients: 1) 50 patients with unclassified developmental defects born to mothers 35 years or older at delivery were tested for UPD for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> autosomes by means of microsatellite marker analysis; 2) The incidence of UPD versus other etiologies in correlation, with maternal age below versus 35 years and above at delivery was studied in patients investigated in our laboratory for maternal UPD 15 (Prader-Willi syndrome, PWS), paternal UPD 15 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, AS), and maternal UPD 7 (Silver-Russell syndrome, SRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In group 1, four patients of 50 showed UPD for an autosome that clarified the etiology of their developmental problems: a 27-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">early puberty</z:e> disclosed maternal heterodisomy 14; a 15-year-old girl revealed paternal isodisomy 15; a 6-year-old boy with suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175694" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="SLOS">Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome</z:e> was shown to have maternal heterodisomy 16 with additional mosaic partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 16(pter-p13); a 16-month-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and a dysmorphic pattern revealed maternal heterodisomy 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group 2 the offspring of older mothers showed a clear increase of UPD compared with the mothers below 35 years at delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The binomial distribution gave P-values of 1.9 x 10(-10), 2.6 x 10(-4), and 0.01 for PWS, AS, and SRS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The correlation between increase of paternal UPD 15 with advanced maternal age might be explained by maternal non-disjunction leading to hypohaploid gamete (nullisomy) for chromosome 15 with subsequent or concomitant duplication of the paternal homologue (paternal isodisomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The three UPD 15 AS cases with mothers older than 35 years at delivery revealed isodisomy, whereas the three cases from younger mothers showed heterodisomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> is a not negligible cause of congenital developmental anomalies in children of older mothers </plain></SENT>
