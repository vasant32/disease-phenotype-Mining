<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a small group of patients, the disease is due to an imprinting defect (ID) that silences the maternal UBE3A allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of a faint maternal band detected by methylation-specific PCR analysis of the SNURF-SNRPN locus in approximately one-third of patients who have an ID but no imprinting center deletion suggested that these patients are mosaics of ID cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients studied, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> was proven by molecular and cellular cloning, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>X inactivation studies of cloned fibroblasts from one patient suggest that ID occurred before the blastocyst stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To quantify the degree of mosaicism, we developed a novel quantitative methylation assay based on real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients tested, the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells ranged from &lt;1% to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis suggests that patients with a higher percentage of normally methylated cells tend to have milder clinical symptoms than patients with a lower percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we suggest that the role of mosaic imprinting defects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> is underestimated </plain></SENT>
