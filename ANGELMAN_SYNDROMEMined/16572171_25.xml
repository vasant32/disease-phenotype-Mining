<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As chromosome 15 is one of seven human chromosomes with a high rate of segmental duplication, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the duplication structure of the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Segmental duplications in chromosome 15 are largely clustered in two regions, on proximal and distal 15q; the proximal region is notable because recombination among the segmental duplications can result in deletions causing Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis shows that the proximal and distal regions of 15q share extensive ancient similarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a simple approach, we have been able to reconstruct many of the events by which the current duplication structure arose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We find that most of the intrachromosomal duplications seem to share a common ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that some remaining gaps in the genome sequence are probably due to structural polymorphisms between haplotypes; this may explain a significant fraction of the gaps remaining in the human genome </plain></SENT>
