<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied cytogenetic/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results and clinical evaluation of 110 marker cases identified from approximately 100,000 cases referred for prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical follow-up performed was focused on cases with de novo markers not derived from chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 110 SMCs, 79 (71.8%) were de novo, 24 (21.8%) were familial, and the origin was undetermined in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight of the SMCs originated from nonacrocentric chromosomes and 52 SMCs were derived from acrocentric chromosomes, with 27 originating from chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of the SMCs from chromosome 15 did not contain the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> was ruled out in 19/19 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical information ranging from birth to 4 years was obtained for 46 de novo cases with nonchromosome-15-derived SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these cases, 11/11 acrocentric SMCs resulted in <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 4/23 cases with single nonacrocentric SMCs and 3/5 cases with two or more SMCs resulted in an abnormal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests an overall low risk for acrocentric SMCs and a higher risk for nonacrocentric SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phenotypes associated with markers derived from some specific chromosomes are also discussed </plain></SENT>
