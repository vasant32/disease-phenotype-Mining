<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This suggests the occurrence of abnormal hypersynchrony in the thalamocortical system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the thalamus, the efficacy of inhibitory synapses between thalamic reticular (RE) neurons is selectively compromised, and thalamic oscillations in vitro are prolonged and lack spatial phase gradients () </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we used computational models to examine how intra-RE inhibition regulates intrathalamic oscillations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A major effect is an abbreviation of network responses, which is caused by long-lasting intra-RE inhibition that shunts recurrent excitatory input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, differential activation of RE cells desynchronizes network activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Near the slice center, where many cells are initially activated, there is a resultant high level of intra-RE inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This leads to RE cell burst truncation in the central region and a gradient in the timing of thalamocortical cell activity similar to that observed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although RE cell burst durations were shortened by this mechanism, there was very little effect on the times at which RE cells began to burst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The above results depended on widespread stimuli that activated RE cells in regions larger than the diameter of intra-RE connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, more focal stimuli could elicit oscillations that lasted several cycles and remained confined to a small region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intra-RE inhibition restricts intrathalamic activity to particular spatiotemporal patterns to allow focal recurrent activity that may be relevant for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thalamocortical function while preventing widespread synchronization as occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
