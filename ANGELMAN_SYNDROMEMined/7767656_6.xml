<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using DNA probes of the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> (PWS/AS) critical region and chromosome-15-specific alpha-satellite, combined with molecular analysis using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47885">dinucleotide</z:chebi> repeat polymorphisms within the PWS/AS region and the parent-of-origin specific methylation sites at the locus D15S63, shed light on how the abnormal karyotype was formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a translocation between the two homologues of maternal chromosomes 15 resulted in the formation of dup(15q) and two reciprocal products: an acentric fragment of 15q that was lost and a centric fragment that underwent U-type reunion to form inv dup(15) </plain></SENT>
