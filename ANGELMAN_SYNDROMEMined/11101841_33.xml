<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A subset of mammalian genes is monoallelically expressed in a parent-of-origin manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These genes are subject to an imprinting process that epigenetically marks alleles according to their parental origin during gametogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Imprinted genes can be organized in clusters as exemplified by the 2-Mb domain on human chromosome 15q11-q13 and its mouse orthologue on chromosome 7c (ref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of this 2-Mb domain on the paternal or maternal allele results in two neurogenetic disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microdeletions on the paternal allele share a 4.3-kb short region of overlap (SRO), which includes the SNRPN promoter/exon1, cause PWS and silence paternally expressed genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microdeletions on the maternal allele share a 0.88-kb SRO located 35 kb upstream to the SNRPN promoter, cause AS and alleviate repression of genes on the maternal allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individuals carrying both AS and PWS deletions on the paternal allele show a PWS phenotype and genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that cis elements within the AS-SRO and PWS-SRO constitute an imprinting box that regulates the entire domain on both chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a minitransgene composed of a 200-bp Snrpn promoter/exon1 and a 1-kb sequence located approximately 35 kb upstream to the SNRPN promoter confer imprinting as judged by differential methylation, parent-of-origin-specific transcription and asynchronous replication </plain></SENT>
