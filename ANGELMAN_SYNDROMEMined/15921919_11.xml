<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It results from lack of the functional maternal allele of UBE3A, which encodes a ubiquitin-protein ligase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Different mechanisms of UBE3A inactivation correlate with clinical phenotypes of varying severity; the majority of cases of AS are due to a de novo maternal deletion of the 15q11-q13 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ube3a maternal-deficient mice (Ube3a m-/p+) were generated in a C57Bl/6J background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study compares cortical EEG and architecture of the sleep-waking cycle in adult Ube3a m-/p+ mice compared with those of age-matched WT (m+/p+) mice, under baseline conditions or after 4-h sleep deprivation (SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ube3a m-/p+ mice exhibited: reduced slow-wave sleep (SWS) amount with increase waking (W) at the dark/light transitions; increased SWS and W episode numbers; and deterioration of paradoxical sleep (PS) over 24 h [amount: -44%; episode duration: -46%; episode number: -40%; theta peak frequency (TPF) acceleration: 7.6 Hz vs. 7.0 Hz in WT mice] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Characteristic paroxysmal EEG discharges are observed during W and SWS associated with synchronous muscle bursting activity during <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactive</z:mp> W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the recovery period following SD, Ube3a m-/p+ mice exhibited no rebound either in slow-wave activity (+89% in WT) or in delta-power spectra but a slight rebound in PS amount (+20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data validate the mouse model produced by null mutation of the maternal Ube3a gene and provide useful results to investigate and better understand the molecular basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> in AS patients </plain></SENT>
