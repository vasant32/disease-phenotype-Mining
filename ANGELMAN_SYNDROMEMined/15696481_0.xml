<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The imprinted SNP rs220028 was chosen as a model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA, after being digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, were typed by mutagenically separated PCR (MS-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism of restriction site was excluded by PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By post-digestion MS-PCR, the methylated allele was detected selectively, the maternal origin of which was confirmed by pedigree analysis; A=0.5085, G=0.4915,PIC=0.3749 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The multiplex analysis of methylation markers and SNP can be achieved by post-digestion MS-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The imprinted SNP locus rs220028 is a potentially useful marker in screening Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
