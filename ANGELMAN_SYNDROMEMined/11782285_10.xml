<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Proximal chromosome 15q is implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> including Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> and developmental abnormalities resulting from chromosomal deletions or duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A subset of genes in this region are subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp>, the expression of the gene from only one parental allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have now identified the NDNL2 (also known as MAGE-G) gene within the 15q <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004352" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">autistic disorder</z:e> susceptibility region and have mapped its murine homolog to the region of conserved synteny near necdin (Ndn) on mouse Chr 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NDNL2/MAGE-G is a member of a large gene family that includes the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> MAGE cluster, MAGED1 (NRAGE), MAGEL2 and NDN, where the latter two genes are implicated in Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have now determined that NDNL2/Ndnl2 is widely expressed in mouse and human fetal and adult tissues, and that it is apparently not subject to <z:mp ids='MP_0003121'>genomic imprinting</z:mp> by the PWS/AS Imprinting Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although NDNL2/MAGE-G in the broadly defined chromosome 15 autistic disorder susceptibility region, it is not likely to be pathogenic based on its wide expression pattern and lack of imprinted expression </plain></SENT>
