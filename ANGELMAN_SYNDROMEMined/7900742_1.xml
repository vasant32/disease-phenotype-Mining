<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although these syndromes are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes, these features are difficult to distinguish in the newborn and early childhood periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such cases, demonstration of chromosomal involvement through cytogenetic studies is of vital importance in arriving at an accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article results of microdeletion analysis of 31 cases comprising 16 cases of Prader-Willi syndrome, 3 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, 7 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MDLS">Miller-Dieker syndrome</z:e>, and 5 of <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied with both high-resolution chromosome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the majority of cases there is 100% concordance between the two techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in one patient suspected of having <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype at the 750 band level, fluorescence in situ hybridization identified a deletion within the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without fluorescence in situ hybridization studies on this patient, it would not have been possible to confirm the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> cytogenetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these results and other studies reported in the literature, it is recommended that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspected cases of microdeletion syndromes should be studied using fluorescence in situ hybridization, irrespective of high-resolution chromosome results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, because of the difficulties associated with clinical diagnosis of these syndromes, fluorescence in situ hybridization should not replace standard chromosome analysis </plain></SENT>
