<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, UBE3A lies within chromosome 15q11-q13 region, where maternal, but not paternal, duplications cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The UBE3A gene product, E6-AP, has been shown to function both as an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and as a transcriptional coactivator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the specific role of E6-AP in the brain, or how loss of function of E6-AP results in AS, is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein, we show, using a recombinant transgenic mouse expressing a Ube3a(YFP) fusion gene, that the maternal Ube3a(YFP) allele is upregulated and preferentially expressed in neurons, and that the fusion protein, E6-AP:YFP, is enriched in the nucleus and dendrites in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also show that E6-AP:YFP localizes to the nucleus and to presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments in cultured hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that cerebellar Purkinje cell number and dendritic branching are not affected in Ube3a maternal-deficient mice, but that dendritic spine development, including spine <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, number and length, is affected on cerebellar Purkinje cells and on pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data suggest that the neurological deficits observed in AS patients and in AS mice may result from specific abnormalities in synaptic development and/or plasticity </plain></SENT>
