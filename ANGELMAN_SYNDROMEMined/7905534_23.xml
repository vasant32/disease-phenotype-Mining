<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These families are associated with a low recurrence risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in a minority of families, more than one child is affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No deletion has been found in these families, except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> in these families is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> modified by imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> cases, with no observable deletion, therefore pose a counselling dilemma as there could be a recurrence risk as high as 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present a series of 93 AS patients, showing the relative contribution of these different genetic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one AS patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases while 12 cases came from six families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty cases had deletions in 15q11-13 detected by a set of highly polymorphic (CA)n repeats markers and conventional RFLPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 familial cases had no detectable deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, two cases of de novo deletions occurred in a chromosome 15 carrying a pericentric inversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one of these the AS child had a cousin with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) arising from a de novo deletion in an inv(15) inherited from his father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One case arose from a maternal balanced t(9;15)(p24;q15) translocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were three cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients were monoallelic for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci across the minimal AS critical region, but the presence of a deletion cannot be confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In familial cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected sibs inherited the same maternal chromosome 15 markers for the region 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two cases were observed with a de novo deletion starting close to the locus D15S11 (IR4-2R), providing evidence for the development of classical AS with smaller deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis proved limited in its ability to detect deletions, detecting only 42 out of 60 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, cytogenetic analysis is still essential to detect chromosomal abnormalities other than deletions such as inversions and balanced translocations since both have an increased risk for deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A staged diagnostic strategy based on the use of highly informative (CA)n repeat markers is proposed </plain></SENT>
