<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of conventional cytogenetics, FISH, Southern blotting and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, it was possible to sub-classify the 17 mar(15)s into six distinct morphological and molecular groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of DNA and metaphase spreads from the probands and their parents using probes and primers from the pericentromeric and Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> critical regions (PWS/AS), clearly differentiated between marker 15s which included the PWS/AS critical regions and those which did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A direct correlation between the presence of the PWS/AS region in the mar(15) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, a system of classification of supernumerary marker 15 chromosomes is proposed </plain></SENT>
