<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of the LGIT for the treatment of refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> cohort with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was treated with the LGIT and followed prospectively over 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parents recorded a daily <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> log for a minimum of 1 month prior to the start of treatment as well as throughout the LGIT trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography (EEG) and neuropsychological assessments (Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2nd Edition were obtained for each subject at both baseline and 4-month follow-up time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluations of subjects were completed by a neurologist and dietitian at the time of enrollment, as well as following both the first and fourth months of dietary therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At each time point, blood for laboratory chemistries was drawn and anthropometric measures were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Six children (mean age 3.3 years, range 1.1-4.8) with genetically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> initiated the LGIT, and completed the trial with no significant adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cohort averages for indices of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> severity were as follows: age of 1.6 years at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 3 lifetime <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs tried (range 1-6), and baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency of 10.1 events/week (range: 0.4-30.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had a decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency on the LGIT, with five of six exhibiting &gt;80% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> posttrial EEG studies showed improvement and three of four children with epileptiform activity on his or her baseline EEG had no discharges present on follow-up EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Developmental gains were noted by parents in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, although few of these neurocognitive gains were statistically significant on neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first prospective study assessing the LGIT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that this dietary therapy is highly effective in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The diet was well tolerated by subjects as evidenced by five of six subjects remaining on the LGIT after completion of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Beyond the prospective trial window, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five subjects who remained on the diet had &gt;90% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> reduction after 1 year of LGIT therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite the small sample size in this prospective study, the results indicate a potentially higher degree of efficacy of the LGIT for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> population than that observed in the general <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although this study is too small to make definitive recommendations, these results suggest that the LGIT is a promising treatment option for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
