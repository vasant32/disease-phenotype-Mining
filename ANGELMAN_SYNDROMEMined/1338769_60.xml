<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), which is caused by either paternal deletion of this region or maternal disomy for chromosome 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, 40% of AS patients inherit an apparently intact copy of chromosome 15 from each parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We now describe a family in which three sisters have given birth to four AS offspring who have no evidence of deletion or paternal disomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that AS in this family is caused by a mutation in 15q11-13 that results in AS when transmitted from mother to child, but no phenotype when transmitted paternally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the loci responsible for AS and PWS, although closely linked, are distinct </plain></SENT>
