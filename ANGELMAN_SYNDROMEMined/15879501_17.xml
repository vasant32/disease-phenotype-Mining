<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of UPD has largely been performed through labour intensive screening of DNA from patients and their parents, using microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to diagnose whole chromosome and segmental UPD and to study the occurrence of continuous or interspersed heterodisomic and isodisomic regions in six patients with Silver-Russell syndrome patients who had maternal UPD for chromosome 7 (matUPD7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have devised a new high precision and high-throughput computational method to confirm UPD and to localise segments where transitions of UPD status occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our method reliably confirmed and mapped the matUPD7 regions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high density SNP arrays can be reliably used for rapid and efficient diagnosis of both segmental and whole chromosome UPD across the entire genome </plain></SENT>
