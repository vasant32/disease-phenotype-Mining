<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated activity-dependent regulation of the AIS, including homeostatic changes in AIS length, membrane excitability, and the localization of voltage-gated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mouse model of AS has been generated and these mice exhibit multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo> similar to those observed in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined intrinsic properties of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA1 from AS model mice and observed alterations in resting membrane potential, threshold potential, and action potential amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The altered intrinsic properties in the AS mice were correlated with significant increases in the expression of the α1 subunit of Na/K-ATPase (α1-NaKA), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel NaV1.6, and the AIS anchoring protein ankyrin-G, as well as an increase in length of the AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings are the first evidence for pathology of intrinsic membrane properties and AIS-specific changes in AS, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
