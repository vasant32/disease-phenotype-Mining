<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to identify genes in the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region, radiolabeled cDNA probes from poly(A)+ <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from mouse tissues were used to identify potential exon-containing genomic DNA fragments in cosmid or phage clones from appropriate yeast artificial chromosomes, and these fragments were subsequently used to screen human cDNA libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A mouse brain cDNA probe was effective in detecting control genes of various abundance including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N (SNRPN), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyl transferase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17138">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, and beta-actin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two genes mapping within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One gene was found to encode the E6-associated protein (E6-AP; gene symbol HPVE6A), a protein which interacts with the E6 protein of human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_445'>papilloma</z:mpath> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other gene is previously uncharacterized and is designated PAR-2 (D15S225E) for Prader-Willi and Angelman region-gene 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imprinting analysis using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from fibroblasts and lymphoblasts of deletion Prader-Willi and Angelman patients demonstrated imprinting of SNRPN with exclusive expression from the paternal allele, but E6-AP and PAR-2 were not imprinted in these cultured human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ability to analyze for imprinting and expression of SNRPN and other genes in this region in cultured human cells will be a valuable tool for analyzing the molecular basis of the Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e>, although imprinting may differ between cultured cells and tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
