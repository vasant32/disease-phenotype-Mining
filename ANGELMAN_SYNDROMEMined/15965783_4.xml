<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed the presence of two novel paternally expressed intergenic transcripts at the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman Syndrome</z:e> (PW/AS) locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transcripts were termed Pec2 and Pec3, for paternally expressed in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imprinting of these transcripts was confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR products in F(1) hybrids between Mus musculus musculus C57BL/6 and Mus musculus castaneus, following identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms between the two strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Imprinting of Pec2 was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two transcripts are separated by 0.5 Mb and are transcribed in the same orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They are located in a long interspersed transposable element (LINE)-rich region midway between the PW/AS imprinting center and the paternally expressed genes Ndn, Magel2, and Mkrn3, which are under imprinting center control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our analysis also revealed imprinting of Magel2, Mkrn3, Ndn, Ube3a, and Usp29, as well as Pec2 and Pec3, in embryonic brain 15.5 dpc, and provided a survey of biallelically expressed genes on proximal Chrs 7 and 15 in embryonic and neonatal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
