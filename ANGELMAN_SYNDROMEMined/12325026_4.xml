<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a rapid, accurate, and quantitative method for the detection of methylation differences at specific CpG sites based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi> treatment of DNA followed by primer extension and ion-pair reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (IP RP HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The application of the method is illustrated by analysis of differentially imprinted alleles arising from Prader-Willi and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to convert unmethylated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosines</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi>, plasmid and genomic DNA samples were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26709">sodium bisulfite</z:chebi> and the targeted sequence was then amplified using oligodeoxynucleotide primers specific for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17137">bisulfite</z:chebi>-deaminated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PCR product(s) from this step was used as a template for a primer extension reaction and the products were subsequently analyzed chromatographically using IP RP HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method eliminates the need to use restriction enzymes to determine the methylation status of the amplicon and circumvents the need for radio labeling for the quantitative measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, this method removes the need for nucleotide sequencing because it is not solely reliant on the presence or absence of one or more PCR products, as is the case with related methods </plain></SENT>
