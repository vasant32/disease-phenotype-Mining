<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor of methylated genes, but MECP2 mutation does not directly affect the imprinted expression of genes within 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested a potential role for MeCP2 in the homologous pairing of imprinted 15q11-13 alleles in human brain tissue and differentiated neurons by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis of control cerebral samples demonstrated a significant increase in homologous pairing specific to chromosome 15 from infant to juvenile brain samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant and specific deficiencies in the percentage of paired chromosome 15 alleles were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RTT</z:e>, AS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> brain samples when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SH-SY5Y <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells also showed a significant and specific increase in the percentage of chromosome 15q11-13 paired alleles following induced differentiation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfection with a methylated oligonucleotide decoy specifically blocked binding of MeCP2 to the SNURF/SNRPN promoter within 15q11-13 and significantly lowered the percentage of paired 15q11-13 alleles in SH-SY5Y cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These combined results suggest a role for MeCP2 in chromosome organization in the developing brain and provide a potential mechanistic association between several related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
