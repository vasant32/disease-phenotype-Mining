<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome 15q11-q14 has been proposed to harbor a gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> susceptibility because deletion of the region leads to Prader-Willi syndrome or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, having phenotypic overlap with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor 3 (RyR3) gene, which is located in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the first study, to our knowledge, that has investigated the association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 14 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 166 Japanese patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> and 375 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the patients and controls in allelic frequencies or genotypic distributions of the 14 SNPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis after confining the subjects to males showed similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides no positive evidence for the association between the RyR3 gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
