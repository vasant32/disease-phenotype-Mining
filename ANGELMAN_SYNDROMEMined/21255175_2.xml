<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> appear strongly motivated by social contact, but there have been few studies that have examined the relationship between sociability and familiarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we compared social behaviour in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> when in contact with mothers and strangers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We systematically manipulated adult familiarity, eye contact and speech to examine the effect on social approach behaviours in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven children (deletion 15q11-13) participated and were observed during interactions with their mother and an unfamiliar adult, while adult eye contact and talking were manipulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laughing and smiling, looking and social approach were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no effect of familiarity on laughing and smiling or eye contact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants showed more social approach towards their mother than the unfamiliar adult but only when their mother was looking at them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, looking at adults, laughing and smiling appear to be unaffected by the familiarity of the adult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, approach behaviours are more common with mothers than strangers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The function of the approach behaviours might be to increase investment from the primary caregiver </plain></SENT>
