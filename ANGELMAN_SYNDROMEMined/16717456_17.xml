<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with features reminiscent of AS, including a pattern of characteristic facial anomalies as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and frequent laughter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the patient had features not commonly associated with AS such as heart malformations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was negative in SNURF-SNRPN exon 1 methylation studies and the G-banded karyotype was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization disclosed a deletion of maximally 1 Mb at 17q21.31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deleted region contains the MAPT gene, implicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e>, and the STH and NP_056258.1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another gene, such as CRHR1, might also be included based on maximum possible size of the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that microdeletions within the 17q21.31 segment should be considered as a possible cause of phenotypes resembling AS, particularly when easily controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> are also present </plain></SENT>
