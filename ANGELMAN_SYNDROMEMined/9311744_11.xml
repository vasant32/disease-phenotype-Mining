<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The lack of normally active paternal genes in 15q11-q13, as an outcome of either a paternal deletion or maternal disomy, accounts for &gt;95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms, including imprinting mutations and unbalanced translocations involving pat 15q11-q13, have been described elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present a patient with a rare balanced, de novo translocation-46,XY,t(2;15)(q37.2;q11.2)-involving breakage within the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> region of the paternal homologue, without an apparent deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient demonstrated several manifestations of the Prader-Willi syndrome but was clinically atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic and molecular studies of this case demonstrated the translocation breakpoint to be between SNRPN and IPW, with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of SNRPN and PAR-5 but absence of IPW and PAR-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that disruption of either IPW expression or a nearby gene by an upstream break may contribute to the Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype and that expression of SNRPN or other upstream genes is responsible for other aspects of the classical Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype </plain></SENT>
