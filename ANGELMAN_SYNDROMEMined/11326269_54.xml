<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although AS patients have infrequent mutations in the gene encoding an E6-AP ubiquitin ligase required for long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP), most cases are attributed to de novo maternal deletions of 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here that a novel maternally expressed gene, ATP10C, maps within the most common interval of deletion and that ATP10C expression is virtually absent from AS patients with imprinting mutations, as well as from patients with maternal deletions of 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
