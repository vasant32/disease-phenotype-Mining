<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>YAC and cosmid clones from 15q11-q14 were used for FISH analysis, to detect the presence or absence of material on each inv dup(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe two types of inv dup(15): those that break between D15S12 and D15S24, near the distal boundary of the PWS/AS chromosomal region, and those that share a breakpoint immediately proximal to D15S1010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the latter group, no breakpoint <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> could be detected with the available probes, and one YAC (810f11) showed a reduced signal on each inv dup(15), compared with that on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of breakpoint <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> may be the result of a U-type exchange involving particular sequences on either homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parent-of-origin studies revealed that, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases analyzed, the inv dup(15) was maternal in origin </plain></SENT>
