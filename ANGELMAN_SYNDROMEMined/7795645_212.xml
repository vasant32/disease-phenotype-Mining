<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using probes from a newly established 160-kb contig including D15S63 (PW71) and SNRPN, we have identified inherited microdeletions in two AS families and three PWS families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletions probably affect a single genetic element that we term the 15q11-13 imprinting centre (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In our model, the IC regulates the chromatin structure, DNA methylation and gene expression in cis throughout 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the imprinting centre can be transmitted silently through the germline of one sex, but appear to block the resetting of the imprint in the germline of the opposite sex </plain></SENT>
