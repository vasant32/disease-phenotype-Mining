<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested that abnormal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurotransmission may underlie some of these deficits, but no effective treatment currently exists for the core features of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A clinical trial of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">L-DOPA</z:chebi>) in AS is ongoing, although the underlying rationale for this treatment strategy has not yet been thoroughly examined in preclinical models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that AS model mice lacking maternal Ube3a (Ube3a(m-/p+) mice) exhibit behavioral deficits that correlated with abnormal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These deficits were not due to <z:mp ids='MP_0003244'>loss of dopaminergic neurons</z:mp> or impaired <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, Ube3a(m-/p+) mice exhibited increased <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> release in the mesolimbic pathway while also exhibiting a decrease in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> release in the nigrostriatal pathway, as measured with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate the complex effects of UBE3A loss on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> signaling in subcortical motor pathways that may inform ongoing clinical trials of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">L-DOPA</z:chebi> therapy in patients with AS </plain></SENT>
