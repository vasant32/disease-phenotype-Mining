<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that the alpha 7-nicotinic receptor gene (CHRNA7) may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alpha 7-nicotinic receptor gene (CHRNA7) is involved in P50 auditory sensory gating deficits, and the genomic locus for this gene lies in the chromosome 15q13-14 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human gene is partially duplicated (exons 5-10) with four novel upstream exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The marker D15S1360 has been shown to be significantly linked with the phenotype of abnormal P50 suppression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marker L76630 is 3 kb in the 3' direction from the last exon of the CHRNA7 gene and is located in the duplicated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The function of the two L76630 copies is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We genotyped three polymorphic markers D15S1360, D15S165, and L76630 that are localized in a genomic fragment containing the CHRNA7 in 31 Azorean <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> families/trios (including 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> individuals and 97 unaffected families members) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An overall analysis utilizing the family-based association test revealed significant linkage disequilibrium between L76630 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> (P = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the extended transmission disequilibrium test and limiting the analysis to one triad per family, transmission disequilibrium of D15S1360 was near significance (P = 0.078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 15q13 region overlaps with the location of two well-known genomically imprinted disorders: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and Prader-Willi syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated maternal and paternal meioses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We found significant transmission disequilibrium for D15S1360 through paternal transmission (P = 0.0006) in our <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The L76630 marker showed a significant disequilibrium in maternal transmissions (P = 0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No parent-of-origin effect was found in D15S165 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results suggest that the CHRNA7 may play a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A parent of origin effect may be present and requires further study </plain></SENT>
