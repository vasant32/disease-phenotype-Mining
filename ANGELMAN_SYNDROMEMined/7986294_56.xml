<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A model for the clinical delineation of atypical cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is based on the presence, at age &gt; or = 10 years, of combined clusters of at least 3 of 6 primary criteria and at least 5 of 11 supportive manifestations appearing through childhood with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model was applied to 16 mentally retarded females, aged 11-47 years (median: 23) who were considered to manifest atypical variants of the syndrome (8 formes frustes, 6 late regression, 2 congenital variants) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of the 16 patients had an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> history as the initial abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the number of supportive manifestations in a series of 41 females over 10 years of age with classic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> are given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differentiating power was tested on 8 patients with a chromosome-verified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the model applied here has the capacity to identify and distinguish <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett syndrome</z:e> variants of different types, to sift out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029576" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">other developmental disorders</z:e> in routine clinical work, and to have potential as a useful research tool </plain></SENT>
