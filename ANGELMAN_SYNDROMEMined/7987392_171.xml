<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two novel transcripts located within 300 kilobases telomeric to the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> N gene (SNRPN) were paternally expressed in cultured cells, along with SNRPN, defining a large imprinted transcriptional domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three PWS patients (two sibs), small deletions remove a differentially methylated CpG island containing a newly described 5' exon alpha of SNRPN, and cause loss of expression for the three imprinted transcripts and altered methylation over hundreds of kilobases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The smallest PWS deletion is familial and asymptomatic with maternal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data imply the presence of a <z:mp ids='MP_0003123'>paternal imprinting</z:mp> control region near exon alpha </plain></SENT>
