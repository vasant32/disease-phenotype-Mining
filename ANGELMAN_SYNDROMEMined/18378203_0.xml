<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a healthy adult male carrying an sSMC(15) with two copies of PWACR in 20-50% of cells from different tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular analyses showed the sSMC(15) as resulting from a PWACR-duplicated region spanning 8Mb which is larger than those in the only two other healthy PWACR-duplicated sSMC(15) carriers previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism level and mosaic cell line rate variation among different tissues observed in our case support mosaicism in critical tissues as of relevance for sSMC(15) phenotype-genotype correlations </plain></SENT>
