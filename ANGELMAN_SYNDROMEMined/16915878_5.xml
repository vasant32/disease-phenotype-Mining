<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to better characterize sensory processing patterns in persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Parents of 340 persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> between 3 and 22 years of age completed a standardized measure of sensory processing, the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results confirmed a high degree and variety of sensory processing abnormalities in persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These problems were most prominent in the areas of hypo-responsiveness to tactile and vestibular input, consistent with reports of sensory seeking behaviors in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensory processing deficits were not related to gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder, or genetic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, some behaviors were correlated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides the first systematic description of sensory processing abnormalities in a large sample of persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Considerations for enhancing occupational performance and social participation in this population through occupational therapy interventions are discussed </plain></SENT>
