<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 protein Ring1B is an ubiquitin ligase that modifies nucleosomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2A, a modification which plays a critical role in regulation of gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that self-ubiquitination of Ring1B generates multiply branched, "noncanonical" polyubiquitin chains that do not target the ligase for degradation, but rather stimulate its activity toward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding implies that Ring1B is targeted by a heterologous E3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified E6-AP (E6-associated protein) as a ligase that targets Ring1B for "canonical" ubiquitination and subsequent degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that both the self-ubiquitination of Ring1B and its modification by E6-AP target the same lysines, suggesting that the fate of Ring1B is tightly regulated (e.g., activation vs. degradation) by the type of chains and the ligase that catalyzes their formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, inactivation of E6-AP affects downstream effectors: Ring1B and ubiquitinated H2A levels are increased accompanied by repressed expression of HoxB9, a PRC1 target gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, E6-AP knockout mice display an elevated level of Ring1B and ubiquitinated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H2A in various tissues, including cerebellar Purkinje neurons, which may have implications to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> caused by deficiency of E6-AP in the brain </plain></SENT>
