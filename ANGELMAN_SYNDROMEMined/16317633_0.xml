<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it presents a number of different systemic conditions that must also be taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the symptomatic spectrum of AS, we sought the aid of families linked to AS associations by sending them a questionnaire designed to investigate the clinical characteristics of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The families were sent a questionnaire aimed at determining the medical and behavioural characteristics of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results from 68 patients were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 4.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first symptoms that called parents' attention were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011968'>feeding problems</z:hpo>, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002020'>gastroesophageal reflux</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean age at which patients were capable of maintaining a sitting posture was 18 months, while autonomous walking was not achieved until 43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e>, which was present in 91% of cases, began with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002373'>febrile seizures</z:hpo> in 55% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study we found that a high percentage of patients with AS have a high resistance to pain (67%), a very common symptom in Prader-Willi syndrome, but little known in AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study offers a wide array of information about the clinical spectrum of AS obtained from an extensive populational sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Some highly prevalent clinical aspects, such as the relative insensitivity to pain, have not been reported in previous publications as a symptom that is typical of AS </plain></SENT>
