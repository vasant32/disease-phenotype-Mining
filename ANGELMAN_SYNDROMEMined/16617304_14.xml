<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To look for locus-specific differences, we have used microsatellites to determine the parental and chromosomal origins of a large series of patients with de novo deletions of chromosome 7q11.23 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175702" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Williams syndrome</z:e>), 15q11-q13 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, Prader-Willi syndrome) and 22q11 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>Di George syndrome</z:mp>) and duplications of 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall the majority of rearrangements were interchromosomal, so arising from unequal meiotic exchange, and there were approximately equal numbers of maternal and paternal deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duplications and deletions of 15q11-q13 appear to be reciprocal products that arise by the same mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion arising from interchromosomal exchanges varied among deletions with 22q11 the highest and 15q11-q13 the lowest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, parental and chromosomal origins were not always independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For 15q11-q13, maternal deletions tended to be interchromosomal while paternal deletions tended to be intrachromosomal; for 22q11 there was a possible excess of maternal cases among intrachromosomal deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several factors are likely to be involved in the formation of recurrent rearrangements and the relative importance of these appear to be locus-specific </plain></SENT>
