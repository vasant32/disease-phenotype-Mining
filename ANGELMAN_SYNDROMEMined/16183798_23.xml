<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome (AS)</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1535926" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">neurodevelopmental disorder</z:e> characterised by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, dysmorphic features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and typical behavioural characteristics, including a happy sociable disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS is caused by maternal deficiency of UBE3A (E6 associated protein ubiquitin protein ligase 3A gene), located in an imprinted region on chromosome 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although there are four different molecular types of AS, deletions of the 15q11-q13 region account for approximately 70% of the AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These deletions are usually detected by fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The deletions can also be subclassified based on their size into class I and class II, with the former being larger and encompassing the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 22 patients with AS due to microdeletions using a microarray based comparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) assay to define the deletions and analysed their phenotypic severity, especially expression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> phenotype, in order to establish clinical correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, children with larger, class I deletions were significantly more likely to meet criteria for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, had lower cognitive scores, and lower expressive language scores compared with children with smaller, class II deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children with class I deletions also required more medications to control their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> than did those in the class II group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are four known genes (NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1, &amp; GCP5) that are affected by class I but not class II deletions, thus raising the possibility of a role for these genes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo> as well as the development of expressive language skills </plain></SENT>
