<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By DNA sequence analysis of cDNA and genomic clones, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and reverse transcriptase-PCR, we have determined that the active human PARN gene is located in 16p13 and that a truncated copy lacking the 5' end is located in 15q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The truncated gene maps close to a copy of the D15F37 gene family at the proximal Prader-Willi/Angelman (PWS/AS) deletion breakpoint region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other copies of the F37 gene family are located at the distal PWS/AS deletion breakpoint region and on 16p11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although PARN and F37 gene sequences are present on 15q and 16p, our data suggest that the synteny of these loci is the result of independent genetic events </plain></SENT>
