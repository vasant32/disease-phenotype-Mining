<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report we show that short probes can be recovered and amplified quantitatively following hybridisation to genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This simple observation forms the basis of a new approach to determining locus copy number in complex genomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The power and specificity of multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation is demonstrated by the simultaneous assessment of copy number at a set of 40 human loci, including detection of deletions causing Duchenne <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> and Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Assembly of other probe sets will allow novel, technically simple approaches to a wide variety of genetic analyses, including the potential for extension to high resolution genome-wide screens for deletions and amplifications </plain></SENT>
