<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chromosome deletions of 15q11q13, paternal <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> (UPD), UBE3A gene mutations, and imprinting center defects are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> commonly recognized mechanisms that disrupt the function of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here two patients with different atypical etiologies of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient is a 3-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>global developmental delay</z:hpo>, severe speech deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and very happy disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis for the maternal and paternal chromosome 15 methylation products showed a mosaic methylation pattern, suggesting an imprinting center defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient is a 4(1/2)-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>global developmental delay</z:hpo>, no expressive language, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) demonstrated a loss in copy number for two overlapping clones encompassing the UBE3A gene, indicating a partial deletion within UBE3A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His mother, who was adopted, had an identical pattern, suggesting that her deletion was probably on her paternally imprinted allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients illustrate the expanding spectrum of molecular findings in AS, reinforce the need to maintain suspicion when clinical features suggest AS but initial testing is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and show the power of CGH as a tool to uncover partial UBE3A deletions </plain></SENT>
