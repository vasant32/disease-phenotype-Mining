<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify such families, cytogenetic polymorphisms of chromosome 15 have been studied in both affected and unaffected siblings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in those cases with a cytogenetically visible 15q11q13 deletion where the recurrence risk is low, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> siblings inherit either maternal chromosome 15 homologue with impunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in cases where the proband does not demonstrate a cytogenetic 15q11q13 deletion, unaffected siblings tend to inherit the alternative homologue to that found in their affected siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings may have importance for genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
