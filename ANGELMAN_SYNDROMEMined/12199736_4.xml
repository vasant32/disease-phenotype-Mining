<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Several studies attempted to clarify the genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inverted duplication of chromosome 15</z:e> [inv dup(15)], which is usually characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in individuals with large duplications including the Prader-Willi/Angelman region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two patients with inv dup(15) who, in spite of a large duplication, had a mild phenotype including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report may help to define the milder spectrum of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 25-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo> had a 6-year history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002121'>absence seizures</z:hpo>, with occasional head drop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interictal EEG revealed diffuse spike-wave complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was well controlled by a combination of lamotrigine (LTG) and valproate (VPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other patient, a 27-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo>, had a 5-year history of rare generalized tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> during sleep, and frequent episodes of unresponsiveness, which appeared to be <z:hpo ids='HP_0007270'>atypical absence seizures</z:hpo> on video-EEG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combination of VPA and LTG led to a remarkable improvement, although no complete control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Molecular analysis revealed a large inv dup15 in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy between the mild phenotype and the severe chromosomal abnormality detected in these two patients further supports the notion that the site of breakpoint might be contributory to the inv dup(15) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inv dup(15) should be considered in atypical cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">generalized epilepsy</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> without clear-cut etiology </plain></SENT>
