<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DEVELOPMENT: The most useful models for studying this problem are the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> in which the genetic defect has been discovered or is being traced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In parallel with advances in genetics, the behaviour patterns found in each disorder are also being defined and are known as behaviour phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this article we aim to illustrate information currently available in the field of behaviour phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The behaviour and intellectual characteristics of the following syndromes are therefore described: fragile X, premutation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016667" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">fragile X syndrome</z:e>, velocardiofacial, Prader Willi, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RTT">Rett</z:e>, Angelman and Williams </plain></SENT>
