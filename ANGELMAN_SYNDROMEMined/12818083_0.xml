<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This marking leads to differential expression of imprinted genes during embryonal development and in adult life </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These can be due to a variety of genetic events, such as loss or mutation of the active imprinted gene allele, disruption of imprinting in parental gamets so that both alleles are imprinted in the same way, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of a chromosome or part of chromosome bearing imprinted genes from a single parent </plain></SENT>
