<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few reports in the ophthalmic literature regarding ocular manifestations of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2,3) We present the case of a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and we review the ophthalmic and systemic findings, as well as recent advances in molecular genetics, in these patients </plain></SENT>
