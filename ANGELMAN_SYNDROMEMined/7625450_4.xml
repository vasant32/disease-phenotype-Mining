<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High resolution banding showed a microdeletion in the 15q11-q13 region in 7 out of 15 PWS patients, and FISH analysis of the D15S11 and SNRPN cosmids demonstrated absence of the critical region in three additional cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Likewise 8 out of 14 AS patients were found to be deleted with FISH, using the GABRB3 specific cosmid, whereas only 4 of them had a cytogenetically detectable deletion </plain></SENT>
