<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We explored the relationship between myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002121'>absence seizures</z:hpo> (MAS) and underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chromosome disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 14 patients with MAS observed in three centers, 5 had typical cryptogenic myoclonic <z:mp ids='MP_0003216'>absence epilepsy</z:mp> (MAE), 2 had MAS associated with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types (1 with signs of a neuronal migration abnormality and 1 with signs of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorder</z:e>), and 7 had MAS, with or without other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types, complicating a chromosome abnormality syndrome-2 with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 12p, 4 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e>, and 1 with inv dup (15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chromosomopathy</z:e>, MAS appeared at a mean age of 2.9 years (range 4 months to 6 years 6 months), had a duration of 4-20 s, and were accompanied by reduced awareness and rhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonic jerks</z:hpo> involving proximal limb muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ictal EEG showed 2- to 3-Hz generalized spike-and-wave discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these patients, MAS differed slightly from those of typical MAE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was earlier, absences were of shorter duration, and no clear increase in muscular tone was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal expression of genes codifying for the subfamily of K+ channels and for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi>-3 subunit receptors (GABRB3), both located in the chromosome segments involved in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008626" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chromosomopathies</z:e> presented by our patients, could be responsible for the same generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosome analysis should be performed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and MAS, especially when the ictal pattern does not completely overlap that observed in MAE </plain></SENT>
