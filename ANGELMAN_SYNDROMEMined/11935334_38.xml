<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the molecular characterisation of 16 independent interstitial duplications, including those of one individual who carried a duplication on both of her chromosomes 15, and three interstitial triplications of the Prader-Willi/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> critical region (PWACR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probands except one, the rearrangement was maternal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one family, the duplication was paternal in origin, yet appeared to segregate in a sibship of three with an abnormal phenotype that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioural disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten duplications were familial, five de novo and one unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 duplications, including two not visible by routine G-banding, were of an almost uniform size and shared the common deletion breakpoints of Prader-Willi syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Like deletions, the formation of duplications can occur in both male and female meiosis and involve both inter- and intrachromosomal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This implies that at least some deletions and duplications are the reciprocal products of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed no instances of meiotic instability in the transmission of a duplication, although recombination within the PWACR occurred in two members of the same family between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the duplicated chromosome 15 homologues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three triplications arose de novo and included alleles from both maternal chromosomes 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Triplication breakpoints were more variable and extended distally beyond the PWACR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The molecular characteristics of duplications and triplications suggest that they are formed by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
