<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>UBE3A encodes an ubiquitin-protein ligase and shows brain-specific imprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have done conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) mutation analysis of the UBE3A coding region in nine AS patients, who had shown a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biparental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> and methylation pattern of the 15q11-q13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disease-causing mutations were identified in five of them: three deletions (1930delAG, 3093delAAGA) and two missense mutations (902A --&gt; C, 975T --&gt; C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both deletions have also been detected in other AS patients, suggesting these sites may be prone to deletions in the UBE3A gene </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening for the UBE3A mutations in the AS patients was found useful both for the confirmation of diagnosis and genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CSGE was found to be a sensitive and simple screening method for these mutations </plain></SENT>
