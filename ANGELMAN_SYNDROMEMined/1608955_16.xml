<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using microdissection, we have recently isolated several DNA probes for the critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report that microclone MN7 detects multiple loci in 15q11-13 and 16p11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones, two genomic phage clones, and two placenta cDNA clones were isolated to analyze these loci in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the YAC clones map to 16p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six YAC clones and two genomic phage clones contain a total of four or five different MN7 copies, which are spread over a large distance within 15q11-13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One cDNA clone is from chromosome 15 and one is from chromosome 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 15 cDNA detects transcripts of 14 and 8 kilobases in various human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of multiple copies of the MN7 gene family in proximal 15q may conceivably be related to the instability of this region and thus to the etiology of associated disorders </plain></SENT>
