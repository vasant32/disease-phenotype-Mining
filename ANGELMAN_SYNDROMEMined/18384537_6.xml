<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Behavioural flexibility scores were assessed in 129 individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> using 11 items from the Behavioural Flexibility Rating Scale-Revised (Green et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Level of behavioural flexibility scores in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> (N = 129) was compared with that of people with non-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> (ID) (N = 90), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (N = 398) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>Autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (N = 235) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparative analyses show that individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> were more flexible than those with non-specific ID (P &lt; 0.001) and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000729'>Autism spectrum disorder</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in behavioural flexibility scores between individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (P = 0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is concluded that individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> are comparatively flexible in their behaviour </plain></SENT>
