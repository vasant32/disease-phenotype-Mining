<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency and extent of epimutations associated with the nine reported imprinting syndromes varies because it is evident that aberrant preimplantation maintenance of imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) may affect multiple loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a custom Illumina GoldenGate array targeting 27 imprinted DMRs, we profiled allelic methylation in 65 imprinting defect patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identify multilocus hypomethylation in numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004903" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008255'>transient neonatal diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (TNDM), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000852'>pseudohypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> 1B patients, and an individual with Silver-Russell syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data reveal a broad range of epimutations exist in certain imprinting syndromes, with the exception of Prader-Willi syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162635" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Angelman syndrome</z:e> patients that are associated with solitary SNRPN-DMR defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mutation analysis identified a 1Â bp deletion in the ZFP57 gene in a TNDM patient with methylation defects at multiple maternal DMRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observe missense variants in ZFP57, NLRP2, and NLRP7 that are not consistent with <z:mp ids='MP_0003718'>maternal effect</z:mp> and aberrant establishment or methylation maintenance, and are likely benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This work illustrates that further extensive molecular characterization of these rare patients is required to fully understand the mechanism underlying the etiology of imprint establishment and maintenance </plain></SENT>
