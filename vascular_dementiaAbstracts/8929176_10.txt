OBJECTIVE: To identify biochemical differences in brain tissue between patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and vascular dementia. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to compare 10 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and 8 age-matched patients with vascular dementia. RESULTS: The ratios of N-acetyl groups to creatine and N-acetyl groups to choline were lower in regions of subcortical white matter in patients with vascular dementia than in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (P < .02). CONCLUSION: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be useful in distinguishing between dementia of the Alzheimer type and vascular dementia.
