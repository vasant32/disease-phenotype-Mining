Three cases of neuroradiologically diagnosed "leucoencephalopathy" are reported. Histopathological examination disclosed Binswanger's encephalopathy in Case 1, congophilic angiopathy with secondary leucoencephalopathy in Case 2, and HIV encephalopathy with secondary white matter changes in Case 3. These three cases demonstrate the unspecificity of neuroradiological findings in "leucoencephalopathy".
