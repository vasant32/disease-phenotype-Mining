N-isopropyl-p-[I-123] iodoamphetamine (I-123 IMP) SPECT studies were performed on a 75-year-old patient who could be clinically classified as subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was quantitatively measured by a microsphere model, and was diffusely decreased in the whole brain (mean rCBF: 36 ml/100 g/minute). After a ventriculoperitoneal shunt operation, his clinical symptoms were markedly improved, and the improvement was validated by a 32% increase of mean rCBF. However, MRI and CT images showed no significant interval changes before and after the shunt operation. Regional rCBF measurement by I-123 IMP SPECT should be performed and plays an important role in the evaluation of Binswanger's disease.
