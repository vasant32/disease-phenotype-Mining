October 2004. A 49-year-old right-handed man developed progressive cognitive difficulties over a 4-month period. There was impairment in recent memory, calculations and language. He also developed fatigue, weight loss, gait imbalance and urinary incontinence. Past history included transfusion-associated Hepatitis C. Neurologic exam showed mild dysarthria, dysnomia, left sided neglect, bilateral Babinski signs, and a prominent grasp reflex. Laboratory testing provided no positive etiologic data. An EEG showed generalized intermittent slowing suggestive of a diffuse encephalopathy and decreased background in the right hemisphere, suggestive of a structural lesion. MRI showed multiple areas of high signal on FLAIR imaging and patchy enhancement. FDG-PET showed multi-focal areas of increased uptake, correlating with the abnormal areas on MRI, on a background of decreased uptake. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram showed no abnormalities. A brain biopsy showed diffuse infiltrates of large malignant cells that were immunoreactive with antibodies to CD20, diagnostic of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In summary, the clinical presentation suggested bilateral hemispheric involvement, which was supported by physical examination, EEG, MRI, and PET scans. The differential diagnosis for this presentation is limited to demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis, vascular dementia, and infiltrating neoplasm such as glioblastoma multiforme or lymphoma. Diagnosis was made by morphologic and immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue.
