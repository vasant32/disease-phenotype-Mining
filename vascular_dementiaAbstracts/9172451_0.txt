BACKGROUND: Binswanger's disease is the most substantial part of the continuum of ischemic vascular dementia (IVD). IVD is the second most frequent cause of dementia in industrialised countries. The frequency of IVD generally, and of the Binswanger's disease especially, is due to the method of statistical data collection, in the Czech republic not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crude rate of Binswanger's disease diagnosed histologically among the autopsies of 132 men and 212 woman aged 60-99 yr. performed at Thomayer's University Hospital from 1. 7. 1995 to 1. 7. 1996 by use of by principle of "epidemiologic" autopsy was estimated at 7.9%. This is about a half of the crude rate of Alzheimer's disease found in the same cohort. By estimating of histological "ischemic score", which is independent on clinical data, it is possible to diagnose the Binswanger's disease with high probability. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnosis IVD generally and of BN in particular is low. IVD/BN is one of the most frequent and consequential ailment in higher age groups. IVD/BN is preventable and curable at earlier stages of development. Knowledge and precise and timely diagnosis of IVD/BN is fundamentally important for patients.
