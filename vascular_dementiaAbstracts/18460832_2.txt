Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) are widely accepted in medical research because this model has been used for studies in neurodegenerative diseases such as vascular dementia and stroke. In the present study, we observed newly generated neuronal precursors using doublecortin (DCX, a marker of neural proliferation and differentiation) in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in SHRs compared to Sprague-Dawley rats (SDRs) at various age stages. DCX immunoreactivity, immunoreactive cell numbers and its protein level in the dentate gyrus of the SHRs were higher than those in the SDRs at postnatal month 1 (PM 1). At PM 8, DCX immunoreactivity, immunoreactive cell numbers and protein levels in both groups were markedly decreased compared to those at PM 1; however, they were higher than those in the SDRs. They were decreased in the both groups with age: DCX immunoreactive cells in the SDRs were few at PM 12. Our results indicate that newly generated neuronal precursors are more abundant in SHRs than in SDRs during their life.
