Sapogenins from Anemarrhenae asphodeloides was reported to improve the learning and memory abilities. In this study, we investigated the effect of Timosaponin B-II(TB-II), a purified extract from A. asphodeloidesb on rat vascular dementia (VD) produced by transient (2h) middle cerebral artery occlusion. The learning and memory abilities of rats were measured by water maze task and passive avoidance task. Daily oral administration of TB-II at two different dose levels of 100 and 200 mg/kg resulted in a significant improvement of the deficit in the learning of the water maze task, beginning 14 days after ischemia. Shortened mean escape latency was detected in TB-II group compared with model group during the same trial days. TB-II treatment also significantly reversed the ischemia-induced retention deficit determined by a one trial step-down type of passive avoidance task. Meanwhile, the expression of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and its receptor were significantly increased in TB-II treated VD rats. The results presented the first evidence of a neuroprotective effect of TB-II in the model of vascular dementia. We suggest that the anti-dementia effect by TB-II is derived at least in part from its anti-inflammatory properties.
