Knowledge about the health economic implications of vascular dementia (VaD) is insufficient. The impact of cardiovascular comorbidities must also be taken into consideration when resource utilization and costs in patients with VaD are analyzed. It is also of great importance that the analysis be done from a societal perspective. In the rural Nordanstig cohort of the Kungsholmen project in Sweden, the major cost drivers in the RUD (Resource Utilization in Dementia) instrument were used. The cost from a societal perspective was 23% higher for patients with VaD compared with patients with Alzheimer's disease ( p = .02).
