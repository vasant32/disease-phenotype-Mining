OBJECTIVE: To discuss the possible role of platelets in Binswanger's disease by studying the changes of organelles and membrane glycoprotein in platelets. METHODS: The organelles (dense bodies, alpha granules, and mitochondria) within platelets were measured with transmission electron microscopy in 25 patients with Binswanger's disease and matched controls, while alpha granule membrane glycoprotein CD62 and lysosomal integral membrane glycoprotein CD63 on platelet membrane were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The percentage of CD62-positive platelets was 3.6% +/- 2.1% and 5.7% +/- 2.4% in controls and in patients, respectively (P < 0.01). The percentage of CD63 expression platelets was 3.1% +/- 2.2% and 3.2% +/- 2.3% in controls and patients, respectively (P > 0.05). When compared with controls, platelets of patients contained fewer alpha granules (P < 0.01), and had no changes in dense bodies and mitochondria (P > 0.05). CD62 levels were different among patients with regarding to the degree of white matter low attenuation. CONCLUSION: There is selective degranuation of platelets in patients with Binswanger's disease and the abnormalities of platelet secretion may play a role in the pathophysiology of this illness.
