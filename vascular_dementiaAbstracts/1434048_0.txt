Marked advances in the treatment of neurological disorders which affect the elderly have been established in recent years. Cerebrovascular disorders including stroke and vascular dementia are still among the most frequent diseases in the Japanese elderly. For treatment of hypertensive patients with or without a history of stroke, slight decrease of blood pressure (BP) is recommended since recent PET studies have revealed that an excessive drop of BP markedly decreases cerebral blood flow. Furthermore, 24-hour-monitoring of BP revealed that physiological fluctuation of BP consisting of high daytime BP and low nocturnal BP disappears in hypertensive patients with vascular dementia and those with non-symptomatic vascular lesions on MRI. Recommendable BP levels for the hypertensive elderly must be established. The efficacy of both aspirin and ticlopidine for prevention of stroke has been established. Recent multi-centric trials have revealed that ticlopidine is more effective in preventing stroke but has more dangerous adverse effects than aspirin. Aspirin is reported to improve both the intellectual scale and cerebral blood flow in vascular dementia. In Parkinson's disease (PD), L-DOPA therapy, usually in combination with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, is common. Other dopaminergic drugs including bromocriptine, lisuride and pergolide are used clinically or are being studied. Recently selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors have been used in order to slow clinical progression of the disease, in addition to an attempt to increase the potential of dopamine through inhibition of MAO. Neural transplants to the striatum of PD were first applied using autografts of the adrenal medulla in 1985, but resulted in transient or only slight improvements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
