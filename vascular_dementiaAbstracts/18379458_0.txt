Neuromidin (ipidacrin) was administered to 41 patients, aged 51-79 years, with mild cognitive impairment (MSI) (19) and vascular dementia (22). The drug was prescribed in increasing dosages from 10 to 40 mg during 6 months (a dosage of 40 mg was administered from the 4th week of the treatment). Cognitive functioning was assessed using some clinical scales (CGI, MMSE, GDS etc) and common neuropsychological tests at the base-line and on the 3rd and 6th month of the treatment. A statistically significant therapeutic effect of neuromidin was revealed in both types of cognitive disorders, with the maximal improvement on the first 3 months and further maintenance of the effect. The most distinct dynamics was observed for memory, attention, abstract reasoning, constructive abilities and general mental activity. The drug was well tolerated.
