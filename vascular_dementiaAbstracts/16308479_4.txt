Frontotemporal dementia regards a group of presenile progressive neurodegenerative form of dementias which includes Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease, frontal lobe degeneration, dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex, familial non-specific dementia mapping to chromosome 3, non-Alzheimer degenerative dementia lacking distinctive histological features as well as a number other infrequent syndromes with dementia and focal neurological signs. The aim of this study was to investigate the regional distribution of metallothionein-I-II, an ubiquitary group of buffering proteins, in cases of frontotemporal dementia. The aim of the present study was to study the metallothionein-I-II expression in relationship to the expression in astrocytes of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as we have already done in previous studies of Alzheimer's and Binswanger's diseases [31,32]. Our findings indicate that metallothionein-I-II expression in the most affected areas is likely to be regionally distinct and layer-dependent, in that it is highest in the deep layers of the frontotemporal cortex and the allocortex (hippocampus) while insignificantly immunopositive in the occipital cortex. In addition, the potential use of metallothionein-I-II as a new pharmacological approach to contrast some deleterious aspects of this disease has been also discussed.
