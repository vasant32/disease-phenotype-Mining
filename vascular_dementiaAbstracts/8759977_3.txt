OBJECTIVE: To examine published imaging criteria that separate cranial computed tomographic (CT) scans into grades of increasing support for a diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD). DESIGN: Patients were divided into 4 grades of increasing extent of vascular lesions on CT. The frequency of VaD was compared between these grades. SETTING: A university department of neurology. PATIENTS: Forty-two consecutive patients who underwent neuropsychological assessment for possible dementia and who had a CT scan performed within 6 months following any stroke causing dementia. Patients with delirium, severe aphasia, and motor and/or sensory deficits that impaired neuropsychological testing and patients with mass lesions or nonvascular white matter disease shown on CT were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria for probable VaD. RESULTS: The frequency of VaD was greater in patients with grade 1 (7 [50%] of 14, P = .01), grade 2 (2[50%] of 4, P = .2), and grade 3(7[78%] of 9, P = .002) scans than the frequency of VaD with grade O scans (1[7%] of 15). There was a linear association of the frequencies of VaD between imaging grades (P = .0008). In a subgroup of patients with neuropsychological deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, there was a linear association of the severity of the deficits between imaging grades (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our criteria can separate CTs into increasing levels of support for a diagnosis of VaD. The extent of vascular lesions on CT reflects the severity of associated neuropsychological deficts.
