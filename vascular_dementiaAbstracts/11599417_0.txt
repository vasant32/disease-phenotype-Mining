We examined the spontaneous and metal-ion-catalyzed oxidative modification plasma blood proteins in the group of healthy adults and elderly ones and patients with vascular dementia (mild and severe). We determined the spectrophotometric measurement of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives formed by reactions with protein carbonyls. The level of metal-ion-catalyzed oxidation proteins in the aged patients both with and without dementia was high in comparison to the healthy adults. The patients with severe dementia showed lower amount of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone deriviates. Low levels of metal-ion-catalysed protein oxidation strongly correlated with the degree of psychoorganic disturbances. The elderly persons with both and without dementia showed a high level of plasma nonenzymatic H2O2 scavenging in comparison with the healthy adult ones. We discovered an imbalance between enzymatic and nonenzymatic components of the antioxidant system. The latter indicates that the oxidative modification of brain tissue proteins probably plays an important role in aging and mental disorders.
