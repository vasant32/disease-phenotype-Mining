The myelin basic protein (MBPi) accounts for the main encephalitogenic antigen of the demyelinating encephalopathy, but other myelin elements also be noted by some articles. We tried to determine the relationship between W1 protein and the demyelinating encephalopathies. The 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phospho-diesterase(CNPase, a gift from Dr. Yasuzo Tuskada) monoclonal antibody was used as a probe to study the W1 protein level in 5 different demyelinating encephalopathies and 2 normal adult brains with immunocytochemical technique. Two different demyelinating types of W1 protein level were found out. Type 1 showed the W1 protein level parallel with demyelinated feature in general pathology whereas the type 2 showed demyelinated in the general pathology but the W1 protein level was normal in the immunocytochemical study. Multiple system degeneration, Binswanger's disease and postvaccinal encephalopathy of type B encephalitis belong to type 1 and multiple sclerosis and Balo's concentric sclerosis belong to type 2. These results might indicate the different pathogenesis of demyelinating encephalopathies.
