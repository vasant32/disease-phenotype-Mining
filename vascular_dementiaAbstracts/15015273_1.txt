OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effect of Tianzhi Granule (TZK) on senile vascular dementia (VaD), which is classified as sthenia of liver-yang. METHOD: Two hundred VaD patients were treated with TZK (0.5 g/bag), which was taken one bag each, three times a day. The treatment course was one month and they were treated for rwo courses. RESULT: TZK could remarkably increase gnosia and activity, with no striking difference from that of positive control group (P > 0.05). Simultaneously, TZK could significantly improve the clinical syndrome of traditional Chinese medicine and viability. It could also drastically reduce the whole blood and plasma viscosity and improve erythrodegeneration and abnormality of aggregation index in the abnormal blood viscosity patients.
