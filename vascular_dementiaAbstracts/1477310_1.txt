This article discusses the role of some pathogenetical factors in the main morphological variants of vascular dementia and their correlation with certain clinical parameters. On the basis of computer-tomographical (CT) studies of 62 patients with dementia, it was possible to distinguish three groups of patients, according to the type of parenchymatous brain lesions: (1) 14 patients with "pure" leukoaraiosis (LA); (2) 23 patients with ischemic foci (IF), and (3) 25 patients with a combination of LA and IF. A comparative study of these groups confirmed the concept that in the development of LA and dementia related to it, a special role is being attributed to such factors as arterial hypertension and aging.
