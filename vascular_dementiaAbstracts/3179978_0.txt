This paper discusses the conditions which may be associated with diffuse periventricular hypodensity on CT. Of these conditions, subacute arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease) is a common differential diagnostic consideration. This condition results from ischemic demyelination with loss of axons and astrogliosis. CT usually shows diffuse bilateral confluent hypodensities in the cerebral white matter. This is most prominent and seen earliest in the periventricular region and may extend more diffusely into the centrum semiovale. It is important to differentiate this condition from normal pressure hydrocephalus and primary nonischemic demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis).
