 OBJECTIVE: Vascular risk factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia, as well as in Alzheimer disease. The effect of antihypertensive medication on risk of dementia is unclear. The aim was to investigate the association between antihypertensive prescriptions and incident dementia, using a primary care database. METHODS: The analysis was based on 575 general and internal practices in Germany (10/2003 - 09/2008) (Disease analyzer database). Antihypertensive medication (ATC codes) during 3 years before newly diagnosed dementia (ICD codes or specific medication) in 1,297 patients was compared to 1,297 controls without dementia after matching for age (mean age: 80.6 ± 8.6 y), sex (females: 62%) and date of diagnosis. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate crude and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals). RESULTS: Betablocker prescriptions (≥ 1 per year over 3 y) showed a significant inverse association with newly diagnosed dementia (Odds ratio, OR: 0.79 95% CI 0.61 - 0.99) after adjusting for demographic covariates, health care use, and cardiovascular and neurological comorbidity. In the fully adjusted model, ACE inhibitors also tended to be inversely associated with incident dementia, but failed statistical significance (OR 0.84 95% CI 0.65 - 1.08). Calcium channel blockers were positively related to cognitive impairment only in the crude analysis. The other drug groups were not significantly related to dementia (diuretics OR: 0.89; 0.67 - 1.19; angiotensin- 1-inhibitors OR: 1.04; 0.66 - 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: This practice-based case-control study indicated a possible protective effect of some antihypertensive agents (betablockers, ACE-inhibitors) on the development of dementia. Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm this finding.
