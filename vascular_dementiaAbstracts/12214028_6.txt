The protein clusterin has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its expression is increased in brain regions affected by AD pathology, and to elucidate if there is a concomitant increase of clusterin also in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in different neurological disorders, CSF samples from patients with AD, vascular dementia (VAD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and controls were analysed. Also longitudinal (five occasions) samples from patients with acute stroke were analysed, to follow any degenerative/regenerative phase after acute brain damage. However, there were no changes in CSF-clusterin levels from patients in AD, VAD, PD or acute stroke, as compared to controls. The increase of clusterin in brain tissue is suggested to reflect a regenerative response process, which here is shown not to be followed by a concomitant increase in the CSF. Thus, CSF-clusterin can not be used as an indicator or a diagnostic marker for AD.
