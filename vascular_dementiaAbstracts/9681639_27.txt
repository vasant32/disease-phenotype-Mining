The distribution of three DNA polymorphisms (XbaI, EcoRI, and I/D) of the apolipoprotein B (APOB) gene, and of the I/D polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene was investigated in 53 patients with vascular dementia, in 80 patients with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease, and in 153 age-matched control subjects. Furthermore, plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured in the three groups and the involvement of the genetic variation at APOB locus on lipid levels was determined. Major findings of this work are (1) no genotype or allele of the polymorphisms examined here seemed to be associated with vascular dementia or with Alzheimer's disease, (2) total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were lower in Alzheimer's disease patients than in vascular dementia patients and in elderly controls, and (3) the dementia patients with APOB EcoRI R+R- genotype had higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels than R+R+ homozygotes.
