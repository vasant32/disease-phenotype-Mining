Involvement of vascular pathology has been suggested in hypertension as well as vascular dementia (VaD), which also have a very high degree of co-occurrence in ageing population. We have recently reported that experimental diabetes as well as hyperhomocystenemia induces VaD. In the present research work, for the first time we are reporting the genesis of VaD by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt induced experimental hypertension. Furthermore, we have also investigated the beneficial effect of telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) and donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), on DOCA-salt hypertension induced VaD in rats. DOCA-salt hypertensive rats performed poorly on Morris water maze, reflecting impairment in their learning and memory. Furthermore, DOCA-salt treatment has shown a significant impairment of vascular endothelial function (DOCA attenuated acetylcholine induced endothelium dependent relaxation), with a significant reduction in serum nitrite/nitrate levels, along with increased aortic, serum and brain oxidative stress levels (aortic superoxide anion, serum and brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species, brain glutathione) and brain acetylcholinesterase activity. Treatments of telmisartan as well as donepezil significantly attenuated DOCA-salt hypertension induced learning and memory deficits, endothelial dysfunction, and changes in various biochemical parameters. It may be concluded that DOCA-salt hypertension induces VaD in rats. ARBs and AChEIs may be considered as potential pharmacological agents for the management of hypertension induced VaD.
