The authors determined rates of brain atrophy, as assessed by the boundary shift integral on serial MRI, in patients with dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB, n = 10), AD (n = 9), vascular dementia (VaD, n = 9), and age-matched controls (n = 20). Mean % +/- SD atrophy rates per year were as follows: DLB, 1.4 +/- 1.1; AD, 2.0 +/- 0.9; VaD, 1.9 +/- 1.1; and controls, 0.5 +/- 0.7. Dementia subjects had higher rates than controls (p < 0.001), but there were no significant differences between the three dementia groups. The authors found accelerating atrophy with increasing severity of cognitive impairment, further emphasizing the need for early diagnosis and intervention in dementia.
