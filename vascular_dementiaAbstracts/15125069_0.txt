We evaluated 143 patients referred to the Memory Clinic St. Gallen for ambulatory dementia assessment between 1995 and 1999. We assessed demographic data, medical results and follow-up data over a mean period of 16 months. 63% of the patients suffered from dementia, 14% had a mild cognitive impairment, 1% had a preexisting debility and 22% had no cognitive deficit. The cause of dementia was Alzheimer's disease in 40% of the patients. Vascular dementia (2.8%) and reversible forms of dementia (2.1%) were underrepresented. In 63 out of 143 patients we examined, if further diagnostic work up (CT or MRI, laboratory testing etc.) or empirical medication by the family physicians led to a change of the initial diagnosis. Follow-up findings confirmed the initial diagnosis in 87.3% of cases. Based on these results we conclude that expensive diagnostic procedures are not necessary in most patients referred for the ambulatory assessment of dementia.
