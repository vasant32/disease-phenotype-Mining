INTRODUCTION: Among different kinds of cerebrovascular diseases, few of them are caused by genetic disturbances, such as CADASIL (caused by Notch3 mutations), CARASIL, mitochondrial encephalopathy, MELAS and dementia typed Binswanger. However, to describe these type of cerebrovascular diseases related with genetic mutations could permit to determinate the causes of both hereditary and sporadic cerebrovascular diseases and then lead solutions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the genetic, environmental and cohort factors that determinate the presence of many affected people by a several cerebrovascular diseases in the pedigree of a large family from Antioquia (Colombia). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed one pedigree (268 individuals), through singular recruit and then complex segregation analysis with POINTER program. RESULTS: The model that more close to data is autosomal dominant mayor locus without influence of environmental factors. Frequency of allele of susceptibility to develop stroke or subcortical vascular dementia was 0.0006. Mayor gene is over epistatic effects or interactions with other gene. CONCLUSIONS: Described an autosomal dominant hereditary model through complex segregation analysis in a pedigree of patients with hereditary cerebral vascular diseases characterized by recurrent strokes, early onset subcortical dementia, hearing loss, antecedent of migraine and MRI signal abnormalities, subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. In this family the parameter calculated, autosomal dominant model, and clinical feature strongly support the diagnostic of CADASIL, linkage analysis and sequentiation will be performed to determinate if mutant gene is Notch3.
