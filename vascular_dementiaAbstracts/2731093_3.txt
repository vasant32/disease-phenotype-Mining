The results of 3 computed tomography (CT) examinations carried out over a 7 year period and of a post-mortem magnetic resonance (MR) study showed aspects of a white matter disease in a hypertensive patient suffering from vascular dementia. Histopathology revealed the primary cause of dementia to be a white matter degeneration sparing the U fibers. Rarefaction of both the myelin sheaths and the axons was present together with severe thickening of the medullary arteries. These findings support the existence of Binswanger's disease (BD) as a distinct variety of arteriosclerotic dementia. CT and MR imaging are valuable aids for diagnosis. However, since there are many other causes of CT and MR demonstrated diffuse white matter degeneration in the elderly, a conclusive diagnosis of BD requires pathological confirmation.
