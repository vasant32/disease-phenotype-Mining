We studied the results of the Visual Association Memory Test (VAMT) in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). In addition, other basic neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were also used. Generally, with the VAMT, AD patients had a worse performance than VaD patients. Particularly among patients with a CDR = 0.5, the AD patients had statistically significantly lower VAMT scores (score less than 3) (p = 0.026) compared to those of VaD patients. However, the VAMT could not predict clinical severity or disease progression. The VAMT, as revealed in this study, is a brief, simply administered, and less biased test, and may offer a diagnostic adjunct to differentiate AD from VaD especially in an early dementia state.
