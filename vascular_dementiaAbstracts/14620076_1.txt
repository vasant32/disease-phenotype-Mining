Increased sexual activity in patients with dementia is problematic for caregivers and has no proven treatment. This report describes two male patients who had dementia with pronounced sexual acting out. One patient had vascular dementia and the other patient had Parkinson's disease with associated dementia. After nonresponse to neuroleptics and sedatives, low-dose cyproterone acetate successfully reduced sexual acting out without relevant side effects in both patients.
