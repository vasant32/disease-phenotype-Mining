Albumin and IgG were determined in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD, n. 13), senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT, n. 33), vascular dementia divided into multi-infarct (MID, n. 9) and probable vascular (PVD, n. 11) dementia. Albumin and IgG ratio and IgG index were calculated. CSF albumin and albumin ratio were significantly higher in MID patients indicating an increased BBB permeability. IgG ratio and IgG index did not show any significant difference among groups. These results do not provide evidence for BBB damage in AD/SDAT, while in MID the increase of CSF albumin and albumin ratio is suggestive of BBB dysfunction.
