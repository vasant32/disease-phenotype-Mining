BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical characteristics and the pathological lesions of so-called vascular parkinsonism (VP) are still debatable. The purpose of this study was to define the core signs and symptoms and assess the cerebrovascular lesions in pathologically confirmed VP. METHODS: In the present study, VP was defined as the presence of parkinsonism and pathological evidence of cerebrovascular lesions but no depigmentation or Lewy bodies at the substantia nigra. We compared the clinical signs and symptoms of 24 VP patients with those of 30 age-matched patients with pathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease. We compared the brain pathology in VP patients with that in 22 age-matched patients with Binswanger's disease (BD) who had no parkinsonism according to clinical records. RESULTS: VP was characterized clinically by a short-stepped or frozen gait, lead-pipe rigidity, absence of resting tremor, and negative response to levodopa. Half or more of VP patients demonstrated pyramidal tract signs and pseudobulbar palsies. There was no significant difference in the extent of vascular lesions at the basal ganglia between patients with VP and with BD without parkinsonism. The extent of frontal white matter pallor tended to be less broad in VP than in BD without parkinsonism. In VP patients, the number of oligodendrocytes in the frontal white matter was significantly less than that in age-matched normal control subjects and significantly more than in those with BD. CONCLUSIONS: The core signs and symptoms of autopsy-proved VP differ from those of typical Parkinson's disease, and most VP patients had diffuse cerebral white matter lesions as well as basal ganglia lesions. VP might be related to frontal white matter lesions.
