The objective of this study was to compare differences in behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive status among geropsychiatric inpatients with Alzheimer's, vascular, alcohol-induced, and mixed dementia. Participants included 150 patients with dementia consecutively admitted to an acute geropsychiatric inpatient unit. Measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, Basic and Independent Activities of Daily Living, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia, and the Initiation/Perseveration subscale of the Dementia Rating Scale. No significant differences existed in the character or severity of agitation among patients with Alzheimer's, vascular, alcohol-related and mixed dementia. Interestingly, patients with vascular dementia compared to patients with other dementias admitted for behavioral disturbances were less cognitively impaired and more medically burdened.
