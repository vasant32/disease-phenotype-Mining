OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Baisuifang Oral Liquid (BSF) in treating vascular dementia. METHODS: Patients selected according to the diagnostic standard of American Association of Psychiatry were randomly divided into two groups, the 37 patients in the BSF treated group and the 28 patients in the control group treated by Naofukang with therapeutic course of 3 months. Changes of clinical symptoms, TCM Syndrome, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and activity of daily living (ADL) score, hemorrheologic characters, platelet aggregation and blood lipid were observed. RESULTS: BSF could ameliorate the symptoms and TCM Syndrome, decrease blood lipid, improve the hemorrheologic character, elevate the MMSE and ADL score of patients. The total effective rate in the treated group was 75.68% and the markedly effective rate 24.32%, which were obviously superior to those in the control group respectively. CONCLUSION: BSF is an effective Chinese herbal preparation in treating vascular dementia, which could promote the restoration of learning memory, and improve the clinical symptoms.
