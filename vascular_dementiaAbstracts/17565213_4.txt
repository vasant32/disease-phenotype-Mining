AIM: To evaluate the beneficial effect of the group reminiscence approach (GRA) in patients with vascular dementia on the aspect of cognitive and observed behavioral parameters. METHODS: Sixty patients who were diagnosed to have vascular dementia were randomly assigned to three arms: group reminiscence arm, social contact arm, and control arm. A 1-hour session of GRA and social contact was given once a week for 3 months to the group reminiscence and the social contact arm, respectively. Only supportive care was given in the control arm. Improvement in cognitive function and behavioral activities were defined as the primary outcome. RESULTS: No significant improvements in the main outcome measures were demonstrated. CONCLUSION: These results do not support the hypothesis that GRA is beneficial to patients with vascular dementia.
