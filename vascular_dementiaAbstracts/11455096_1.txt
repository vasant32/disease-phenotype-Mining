In the present study we examined cognitive function, radiographic features, and functional ability in individuals with vascular dementia (VaD). Subjects were subdivided into individuals with only white matter involvement (WM) and individuals with evidence of a cortical infarction in addition to white matter ischemic change (C+WM). Results revealed that both groups of subjects were impaired across cognitive functions. Cognitive performance was more severely impaired among the C+WM group, but the general pattern of deficits did not differ between the two groups. Hachinski scores were significantly higher and instrumental activities of daily living were more severely affected in the C+WM group compared to the WM group. No significant differences were evident between the two groups on overall dementia severity or the extent of white matter involvement. These findings indicate that cognitive function in VaD may be globally impaired, and that cortical infarction in addition to white matter ischemia results in greater impairment, but the differences are largely quantitative rather than qualitative.
