 OBJECTIVE: To test the influence of acupuncture on cognitive function and a marker of oxidative DNA damage in patients with vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Sixteen VD patients were evaluated before and after acupuncture, using the Folstein mini-mental state examination-revised (MMSE-R) to assess cognitive function, and the ADL-R scale to assess independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Life quality was evaluated using the DEMQOL (Dementia quality of life questionnaire) questionnaire, and syndromes and expression of vascular dementia were evaluated with the Scale for the differentiation of syndromes of vascular dementia (SDSVD). In addition, the urine concentration of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)--a marker of oxidative damage--was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The MMSE-R and DEMQOL scores were higher after acupuncture than before (P < 0.05), while there were no obvious differences in the ADL-R or SDSVD scores (P > 0.05). The 8-OHdG content in urine significantly decreased after acupuncture (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture reduces the levels of 8-OHdG and improves cognitive function and quality of life in VD patients, suggesting that acupuncture is beneficial at least in part by preventing oxidative damage.
