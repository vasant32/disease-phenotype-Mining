 BACKGROUND: ischaemic cerebrovascular small vessel disease (SVD) is a prevalent and under-diagnosed condition that triggers vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). OBJECTIVE: to describe the neuropsychological and clinical profiles in SVD (Binswanger's disease, BD; lacunar state, LS) from the clinician's perspective at the VCI stage. METHODS: a total of 1257 patients admitted to a tertiary center with a diagnosis of stroke, neuroradiological vascular disease, cognitive impairment/dementia, during a 13-year period were investigated. We prospectively assessed cognition in a subset of 141 patients with VCI (LS n = 28, BD n = 69, large vessel disease-LVD-n = 44) with MMSE, CAMDEX-H, WAIS-R, EXIT-25 and Trail making test. RESULTS: executive dysfunction (ECD) (n = 89, 91.7% versus n = 10, 22.7%; P < 0.001) and gait disturbances (n = 74, 76.3% versus n = 15, 34.1%; P < 0.001) characterized SVD. Prior strokes (n = 9, 9.3% versus n = 23, 52.3%; P < 0.001) and embologenous cardiopathy (n = 39, 40.2% versus n = 28, 63.6%; P < 0.04) featured LVD cases. BD was defined by hypertension (n = 52, 75.4% versus n = 30, 44.1%; P < 0.001), ECD (n = 65, 94.2% versus n = 34, 47.2%; P < 0.001) and VCI onset with cognitive impairment but not strokes (n = 44, 63.8% versus n = 34, 50%; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ECD and a frontal gait are SVD's clinical landmarks in our sample. LS and BD cases share a similar cognitive profile.
