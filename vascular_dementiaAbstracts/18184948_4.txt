Vascular dementia (VaD) is associated with a large amount of heterogeneity, as it groups together a broad category of patients in whom various manifestations of cognitive decline are attributed to cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. Thus, a study was designed to determine the effects of rivastigmine on cognitive function, global daily living performance, and behavioral disorders in VaD patients versus an active control (nimodipine), stratifying patients according to the type of VaD, subcortical vascular dementia (sVAD), and multi-infarct dementia (MID). The trial was a prospective study. This study shows that long-term treatment with rivastigmine, at dosages approved for therapeutic use in Alzheimer's disease, produces significant improvement in all behavioral symptoms in 2 forms of VaD, MID and sVaD, except delusions. It also suggests that rivastigmine may enable a reduction in concomitant neuroleptics and benzodiazepines in VaD, especially in MID. The results are discussed with an overview of the literature.
