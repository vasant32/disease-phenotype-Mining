In 1994 several European studies will have available risk factor information on incident cases of dementia collected in prospective community-based studies. These centers will collaborate in a nested-case control study based on the pooled cases and a sample of the non-diseased respondents. This paper describes the general design and the risk factors to be studied in a European nested case-control study of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.
