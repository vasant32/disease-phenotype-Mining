 OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Kangxin capsule (KXC) on homocysteine (HCY) and beta-amyloid protein (beta-Ap) in patients with vascular dementia. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with vascular dementia were randomly divided into two groups, the 33 patients in the treated group and the 30 in the control group. Basal treatment were given to both groups, besides, KXC was given to the treated group and Hydergine was given to the control group. The levels of plasma HCY, beta-Ap as well as the changes of mini mental state examination (MMSE), activity of daily living (ADL) and TCM Syndrome scoring were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: KXC could significantly decrease the levels of HCY and beta-Ap (P < 0.01), rise the MMSE scores, reduce ADL scores and ameliorate TCM Syndrome. CONCLUSION: KXC can effectively regulate the levels of HCY, beta-Ap in vascular dementia patients.
