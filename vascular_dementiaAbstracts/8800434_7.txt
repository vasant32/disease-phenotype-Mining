Acetylcholine esterase, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylenglycol (MHPG), norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were quantified. Positive wave with the latency about 300 msec (P300) and electroencephalography (EEG) were examined in 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 10 patients with vascular dementia, and 10 age-matched healthy controls. Serum alpha 1-antichymotrypsin concentrations were significantly higher in the Alzheimer's disease group than in the vascular dementia and healthy control groups. Homovanillic acid concentrations in CSF were significantly lower in the vascular dementia group than in the Alzheimer's disease and the healthy control groups. A significant positive correlation was present between the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score (normal range of 24 to 30) and the acetylcholine esterase concentration in the CSF. Significant negative correlations were present between the MMSE score and the P300 latency, between the MMSE score and the MHPG concentration in the CSF, between the MMSE and the norepinephrine concentration in the CSF, and between the MMSE score and the dopamine concentration in the CSF.
