Galantamine is efficacious for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Its application leads to some negative gastrointestinal side effects. The present study observes galantamine-induced influence on gastrointestinal motility of rats and its effects on isolated gastrointestinal smooth muscles. The gastrointestinal tract was studied by X-ray contrast examination. Functional disturbances were observed: hypertonia, increased stomach and ileal peristalsis activity, accelerated intestinal passage. In vitro, the drug caused tonic contractions in smooth muscle preparations and increased the gastric and ileal phasic amplitude. The jejunal smooth muscle strips demonstrated an opposite tendency. The reactions were a result of the interaction of galantamine-accumulated endogenic acetycholine with M- and N-acetylcholine receptors. The tonic effects were influenced in varying degree by atropine and ipratropium, whereas the phasic by atropine, ipratropium, hexametonium and methysergide. In conclusion, the in vitro effects registered satisfactorily explain in vivo examined galantamine-induced changes in the gastrointestinal tract of the treated rats and can be considered as main cause for development of such changes.
