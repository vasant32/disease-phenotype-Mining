The genes for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, m1 and m2, were studied in autopsied brains from nine Alzheimer's disease, six vascular dementia and three control. The genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced by the dideoxy method. Although one DNA polymorphism was found in m1, the deduced amino acid sequences of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor were unchanged. The amino acid sequences of m1 and m2 in Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were intact.
