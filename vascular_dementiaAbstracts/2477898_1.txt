The psychiatric characteristics of one highly suspected case of Binswanger's disease were discussed. The diagnosis was based on the clinical state and the CAT-scanner; this case was associated with particular psychiatric profile: a major depressive syndrome, an obsessional behavior and a major inhibition, with only slight symptoms of dementia. The psychiatric symptoms might help to the early diagnosis of this subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy.
