We report a case of bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis treated with stenting. A 78-year-old man suffered from vascular dementia and left hemiparesis, and, by magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), was diagnosed as having bilateral ICA stenosis. Cerebral angiogram showed severe, bilateral ICA stenosis (right; 88%, left; 93%) and xenon single photon emission tomography (SPECT) showed severely decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). We performed bilateral carotid angioplasty with self-expanding stents. Both CBF and CVR were improved bilaterally after the operation. The patient was discharged without neurological deficits. Carotid stenting may be an alternative treatment for severe ischemia caused by severe, bilateral ICA stenosis.
