BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Since the Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards (VCIHS) neuropsychological test protocol was proposed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Canadian Stroke Network, no studies have applied this neuropsychological protocol to poststroke survivors in a large-scale, multicenter stroke cohort. We determined the frequency of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and investigated the feasibility of using the Korean version of the VCIHS neuropsychological protocol in a multicenter, hospital-based stroke cohort in Korea. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 620 subjects with ischemic stroke within 7 days of symptom onset among 899 patients who were consecutively admitted to 12 university hospitals in Korea. Neuropsychological assessments using the 60-minute Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol were administered at 3 months after stroke. RESULTS: Of the 620 patients, 506 were followed up at 3 months after stroke. Of these, 353 (69.8%) were evaluated for cognitive function using the 60-minute Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol. The frequency of VCI at 3 months was 62.6%: VCI with no dementia in 49.9% and vascular dementia in 12.7%. Old age (P=0.014), poor functional outcomes at 3 months (P=0.029), and stroke subtypes other than small vessel disease (P=0.004) were independent risk factors of VCI. CONCLUSIONS: VCI, evaluated using the Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol, is substantial at 3 months after ischemic stroke in Korea. The use of the 60-minute Korean VCIHS neuropsychological protocol was feasible in large-scale multicenter studies.
