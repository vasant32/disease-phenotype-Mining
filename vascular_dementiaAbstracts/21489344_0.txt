 BACKGROUND: The Prospective Research In MEmory clinics (PRIME) is a three-year non-prescriptive, observational study identifying and measuring relationships among predictor and outcome variables. METHODS: Patients from nine memory clinics, diagnosed with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), living in the community with <40 hours/week nursing care were divided into diagnostic groups defined at baseline as Alzheimer's disease (AD) early or late onset, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia (VaD), mixed (AD and VaD) and other dementia. To achieve outcome measures, baseline and change over six months in all measures by diagnostic group, and predictors of change at six months were examined. RESULTS: Of the 970 patients enrolled, 967 were eligible for analysis. The most common disorder was AD (late onset) accounting for 46.5% of this population. Patients had an overall slight worsening on all assessment scales over the six-month period. Patients with FTD had a more marked change (decline) in cognition, function and behavior over six months compared to other diagnostic groups. However, in the regression analysis the difference was not significant between groups. Predictors of decline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were not robust at six months, and longer follow-up is required. Patients with FTD were more likely to be prescribed psychotropics. CONCLUSION: The PRIME study is continuing and will provide important data on predictors of decline along with differences between diagnosis groups on the rate of change.
