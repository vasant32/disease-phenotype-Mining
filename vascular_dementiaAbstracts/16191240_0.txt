BACKGROUND: There are difficulties in accurately defining patients with vascular dementia (VaD) and, therefore, little is known about the characteristics of this population. OBJECTIVE: To examine the population characteristics in patients with VaD enrolled in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week clinical trials of the efficacy and tolerability of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil. METHODS: Enrolled patients had probable or possible VaD, classified according to NINDS-AIREN criteria. Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or dementia caused by other conditions not associated with the cardiovascular system. RESULTS: A total of 1,219 patients, 73% with probable VaD and 27% with possible VaD, were enrolled. Patients had a mean Hachinski score of 9.7, with memory impairment the most prominent feature of their dementia. Sixty-eight percent of patients had a history of at least one stroke and 28% of patients had a history of transient ischemic attack before dementia. In the 99% of patients who had abnormal computer-assisted tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, cortical and subcortical infarcts were among the lesions observed, with significant white-matter lesions also present in some patients. Seventy-three percent of patients had experienced an abrupt onset of cognitive symptoms. Vascular risk factors were prominent and included hypertension (70%), smoking (62%), and hypercholesterolemia (39%). CONCLUSIONS: The patients enrolled in these trials had probable or possible VaD; these patients exhibited a history of cerebrovascular disease and a broad range of comorbid cardiovascular conditions. The large number of patients enrolled will permit a thorough examination of the efficacy and tolerability of donepezil in VaD.
