In 229 patients with dementia and in 144 control subjects, polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor-related protein, alpha(2)-macroglobulin, interleukin (IL) 1beta, angiotensin-converting enzyme and of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase genes were investigated. In plasma, antibodies against Chlamydia pneumoniae and lipids were determined. Dementia was classified as probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), probable dementia of vascular origin (VaD) and mixed dementia (MD). An association of the disease with ApoE and IL-1beta polymorphism and increased levels of LDL cholesterol were observed in AD and in MD but not in VaD.
