Phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), cyclooxygenase (COX) and prostaglandin (PG) synthase are enzymes involved in arachidonate cascade. PLA(2) liberates arachidonic acid (AA) from cell membrane lipids. COX oxidizes AA to PGG(2) followed by an endoperoxidase reaction that converts PGG(2) into PGH(2). PGs are generated from astrocytes, microglial cells and neurons in the central nervous system, and are altered in the brain of demented patients. Dementia is principally diagnosed into Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). In older patients, the brain lesions associated with each pathological process often occur together. Regional brain microvascular abnormalities appear before cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. The coexistence of AD and VaD pathology is often termed mixed dementia. AD and VaD brain lesions interact in important ways to decline cognition, suggesting common pathways of the two neurological diseases. Arachidonate cascade is one of the converged intracellular signal transductions between AD and VaD. PLA(2) from mammalian sources are classified as secreted (sPLA(2)), Ca(2+)-dependent, cytosolic (cPLA(2)) and Ca(2+)-independent cytosolic PLA(2) (iPLA(2)). PLA(2) activity can be regulated by calcium, by phosphorylation, and by agonists binding to G-protein-coupled receptors. cPLA(2) is upregulalted in AD, but iPLA(2) is downregulated. On the other hand, sPLA(2) is increased in animal models for VaD. COX-2 is induced and PGD(2) are elevated in both AD and VaD. This review presents evidences for central roles of PLA(2)s, COXs and PGs in the dementia.
