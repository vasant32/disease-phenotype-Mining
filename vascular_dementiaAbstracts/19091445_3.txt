The progression of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) to Alzheimer's disease and hypothesized progression of non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (na-MCI) to non-degenerative or vascular dementias suggest etiologic differences. We examined the association between coronary heart disease (CHD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes in a population-based cohort. Participants (n=1969; aged 70-89 years) were evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, a neurological examination, and neuropsychological testing for diagnoses of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia. CHD was defined as a history of myocardial infarction, angina, angiographic coronary stenosis, or coronary revascularization and ascertained by participant interview and from medical records. CHD was significantly associated with na-MCI (OR=1.93; 95% CI=1.22-3.06) but not with a-MCI (OR=0.94; 95% CI=0.69-1.28). In contrast, ApoE É›4 allele was significantly associated with a-MCI (OR=1.75; 95% CI=1.28-2.41), but not with na-MCI (OR=1.17; 95% CI=0.69-2.00). The association of CHD with prevalent na-MCI but not with a-MCI suggests that CHD and na-MCI may have similar underlying etiologies.
