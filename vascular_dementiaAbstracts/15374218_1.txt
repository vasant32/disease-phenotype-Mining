The diagnosis of dementia disorders can be made in several steps. The symptomatology, severity and course of the illness must be considered. Memory disturbances must be present. Ante-mortem classification of dementias is based on known or assumed etiology. The final step is the post-mortem diagnosis. Of the primary dementias, Alzheimer-type dementia is the most important group. Accumulating data indicate that this form can be divided into subgroups. The concept of multi-infarct dementia (MID) should not be used synonymously with vascular dementia, which is a broader concept. Vascular dementias can also be divided into subgroups. Dementia is an advanced stage of a brain disorder. It seems important to identify brain disorders before they have reached the advanced level of dementia. A name for such disorders is dysmentia.
