OBJECTIVE: To study the integrity of the white matter in Binswanger's disease (BD) patients with quantitative fractional anisotropy (DTI-FA). METHOD: Controls (12) and patients with BD (12) were included. Scans performed with MR (GE Signa Horizon/1.5T). Fazekas's score=6 with white matter hyperintensities extension >75% assessed on FLAIR scans. Standard parameters for DTI-FA were used. ROIs placed in symmetrical regions on two axial planes, data pooled in anterior (frontal) and posterior (temporo-parieto-occipital) regions. Analysis with Functool. Statistics for anterior and posterior regions comparison. RESULTS: DTI-FA showed reduction of anisotropy, reflecting axonal damage and demyelination of fibers, more prominent in anterior in relation to posterior region, in BD patients in comparison to controls. CONCLUSION: Loss of integrity of fiber tracts reflects interruption of neural networks that subserve cognitive, behavioral, and motor integration. The more severely affected frontal region is related to executive dysfunction, a characteristic feature of Binswanger's disease.
