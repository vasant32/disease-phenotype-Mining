BACKGROUND: Increased concentration of plasmatic homocysteine (tHcy) and decreased vitamin B 12 (B12) and folate (FOL) are associated with Alzheimer's (AD) and vascular (VaD) dementias, with type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and reported as risk factors of these diseases. METHODS: The sample (n=122; males=60; mean age=73+/-7 years) comprised AD and VaD patients without DM, with a concomitant DM (AD+DM, VaD+DM), DM alone and controls (CTR), resulting in 6 groups. tHcy, B12 and FOL were determined in duplicate. RESULTS: The one-way ANOVA yielded significant differences between groups for all variables: tHcy p<10(-12); B12 p<10(-3); FOL p<10(-4). Significance for comparisons between groups was set at alpha=0.05, using the Bonferroni's statistic. The comparisons: DM vs. CTR, AD+DM vs. AD, VaD+DM vs. VaD, and DM demented vs. DM non-demented resulted significant for all variables, except for B12 in 2 comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: In demented and control subjects, tHcy and FOL exhibit extreme differences, not so marked between DM and controls. Demented patients with concomitant diabetes are closer to controls than their non-diabetic counterparts. Diabetes affects tHcy and FOL values, which are changed with opposite sign to non-demented. These results suggests a paradoxical phenomenon when diabetes is superimposed to dementias.
