The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of baicalein on cognitive impairment and neuronal degeneration in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2VO). It was found that baicalein (2 or 4 mg/kg/day, i.p.) significantly improved 2VO-induced cognitive deficits and neuropathological changes. Biochemical and histological examinations revealed that baicalein reduced the increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and attenuated the decreased activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase in 2VO rats. The results of the present observation suggest that baicalein has therapeutic potential for the treatment of vascular dementia, which is most likely related, at least in part, to its antioxidant action.
