The correlation between the severity of dementia and the amplitudes of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) was studied. The subjects were 78 patients with dementia (20 males, 58 females) whose mean age was 80.5 +/- 6.7 years. Normal subjects were 9 elderly persons (2 males, 7 females) whose mean age was 79.2 +/- 6.0 years. The amplitudes of wave-I, -III and -V were measured. As for individual differences: (1) The amplitudes of BAEPs in the male group were lower than that in the female group, there was no significant difference. (2) The amplitudes of wave-V in female patients with vascular dementia were significantly lower than that of degenerative dementia. (3) The amplitudes of wave-III reduced as the duration of illness prolonged. Dividing the patients into three groups according to the severity of dementia which are mild, moderate and severe. (4) The amplitudes of the wave-V reduced significantly as the severity of dementia advanced. There was a significantly positive correlation between the amplitudes of the wave-V and the Hasegawa's dementia scores (r = 0.404759, p < 0.05) Based upon the above results, the brainstem dysfunction might progress with the severity of dementia.
