Vascular dementia is seen much more often in people at age 85 than in those between the ages of 55 and 75. The differential diagnosis includes Alzheimer's disease and mixed dementia. The classic criteria for vascular dementia--stepwise deterioration and focal neurologic signs--are important, as focal neurologic signs usually don't occur in Alzheimer's disease. Identifying a significant number of points on the Hachinski scale, including hypertension, can help make a diagnosis of vascular disease. For more effective differential diagnosis, CT or MRI can be useful. However, not all clinicians are convinced of the necessity of imaging, as long as stroke risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia are managed for all older patients.
