OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of Xianlong Capsule (XLC) in treating the senile vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Forty-six cases of VD were randomly divided into two groups. The XLC group (24 patients) were treated with XLC and the control group (22 patients) were treated with Hydergine. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Hamilton depression scale (HDS) marks and clinical symptoms were observed in different groups. RESULTS: XLC could markedly increase MMSE and HDS marks of VD patients. XLC had the effect of improving balance and gait ability of VD patients. CONCLUSION: XLC had certain effect on VD and its effect was better than that of Hydergine.
