In this study we surveyed a total of 218 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with different neurological diseases including Alzheimer disease, non-Alzheimer forms of dementia, other neurodegenerative diseases without dementia and normal controls to quantitate by capture ELISA the concentrations of the immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules L1 and NCAM, and characterized by immunoblot analysis the molecular forms of L1 and NCAM. We found a significant increase of L1 and a strong tendency for increase of the soluble fragments of NCAM in the CSF of Alzheimer patients compared to the normal control group. The proteolytic fragments of L1, but not NCAM were also elevated in patients with vascular dementia and dementia of mixed type. Higher L1 concentrations were observed irrespective of age and gender. NCAM concentrations were independent of gender, but positively correlated with age and, surprisingly, also with incidence of multiple sclerosis. Thus, there was an influence of Alzheimer and non-Alzheimer dementias and neurodegeneration on L1, whereas age and neurodegeneration influenced NCAM concentrations. These observations point to an abnormal processing and/or shedding of L1 and NCAM in dementia-related neurodegeneration and age, respectively, reflecting changes in adhesion molecule-related cell interactions.
