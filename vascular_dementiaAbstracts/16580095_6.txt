Although vascular dementia (VaD) is a main pathology in nonagenarians and centenarians, the validity of clinical criteria for this diagnosis is unknown. We analyzed 110 autopsy cases and reported sensitivities and specificities of the State of California Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC) and National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS-AIREN) criteria for possible VaD as well as Hachinski ischemic score (HIS). Among them, there were 36 neuropathologically confirmed VaD cases. All criteria displayed comparable sensitivities (0.56-0.58). Specificities values were 0.74, 0.73 and 0.66, respectively. There was an age-related decrease on ADDTC criteria sensitivity due to the fact that 42% of pure VaD cases did not present with stroke. Thirty percent of mixed dementia (MD) cases were diagnosed as VaD by both NINDS-AIREN and ADDTC criteria. This proportion reached 45.9% for the HIS. These data demonstrate that the new diagnostic criteria for possible VaD do not provide a substantial gain of sensitivity compared to the HIS. Although their specificity was significantly lower in this age group compared to younger cohorts, all of them successfully exclude AD cases.
