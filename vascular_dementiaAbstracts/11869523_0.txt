OBJECTIVE: To study the pathology, incidence and etiology of Binswanger's disease. METHODS: Autopsied brains from 9 cases of Binswanger's disease and 13 cases of non-demented elderly individuals were studied by clinico-pathological, immunohistochemical and micrometer methods. RESULTS: The lesions of Binswanger's disease were mainly located in the subcortical white matter, periventrical regions, brainstem and cerebellum. The pathological changes were demyelination, lacunar infarction, gliosis and dilatation of perivascular space (Virchow-Robin space, VR space, P < 0.01). The wall thickness of deeply penetrating arteries in the white matter was significantly increased (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Binswanger's disease is not a rare entity. The findings of this study suggest that arteriosclerosis is a primary factor in the pathogenesis of Binswanger's disease.
