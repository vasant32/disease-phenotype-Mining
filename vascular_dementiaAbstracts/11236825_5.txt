To evaluate the stability and reproducibility of selected peripheral oxidative stress markers and their possible relation to cognitive performance, three different blood samples were taken at 7- to 10-day intervals from 11 patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and 11 nondemented controls. Blood samples were also collected once from 6 patients with vascular dementia (VD). Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), C-reactive protein (CRP), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lactoferrin (LTF), and total lipid peroxidation (LPO) were then measured. Blood levels of ACT and GSH-Px were increased in AD patients but not in patients with VD. Levels of LTF, CRP, and LPO were comparable between AD patients and controls. Erythrocyte SOD activity was increased in AD patients. Blood levels of ACT negatively correlated with LPO levels and positively correlated with scores of the Global Deterioration Scale of AD patients. ACT might be implicated in controlling oxidative damage of blood lipids and their turnover during the progression of AD.
