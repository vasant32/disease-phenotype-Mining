With regards to the applications of three Chinese herbs poria, rhizoma atractylodis macrocephalae, and radix angelicae sinensis to vascular dementia (VD), the work was performed to assess the nootropic action and explore neuroprotective mechanisms of three herbs combinations (FBD) on mice injured by cerebral repetitive ischemia-reperfusion (IR). Aqueous extracts from FBD (115-460 mg/kg) administered p.o. significantly improved cognitive function through elongating latency and reducing number of errors in step-through test. Aqueous extracts from FBD inhibited lipid peroxidation (LPO), elevated activity in (Na+)-(K+)-ATPase and (Ca2+)-ATPase, reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO) in cortical tissue after IR, and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing aqueous extracts from FBD (ACSF-FBD) (0.01-10 mg/L) protected also primary cortical cortex neurons (PCCN) from hypoxic and excitotoxic insult induced by sodium dithionite (1 mM) and monosodium glutamate (MSG) (0.5 mM) in vitro. Multiple anti-IR properties contributed probably FBD to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction shown in this murine model for VD.
