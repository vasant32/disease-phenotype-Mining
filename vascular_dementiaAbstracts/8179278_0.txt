The recent development of neuro-imaging technology has altered the classic anatomo-clinical pattern of vascular dementias (VD). However, few correlative studies have emerged and the creation of new eponyms--such as the successful "leuko-araiosis"--did not raise new highlights on the mechanisms involved in VD. The different clinical and radiological aspects of VD are briefly reviewed and the contribution of CT-scan and MRI are discussed.
