We describe multi-focal delayed neuronal death of rat brain after transient regional ischemia induced by embolization of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). After sixty minutes of MCA occlusion, recirculation was achieved by removal of the embolus. Chronological changes in the distribution of the neuronal damage were determined by using the 45Ca autoradiographic technique and the histological examination. Sixty minutes after MCA occlusion, 45Ca accumulation extended to the lateral segment of the caudate putamen and the cerebral cortex supplied by the occluded MCA. Moreover, three days after ischemic insult, 45Ca had accumulated in the ipsilateral thalamus and substantia nigra. Histological examination revealed that the neurons in both area suffered damage and were selectively reduced in number. Both areas lie outside the ischemic area, but have transsynaptic connections with the ischemic focus. We suggest that the postischemic delayed neuronal death in exo-focal remote areas may be caused by a transsynaptic process associated with the infarcted areas and that these delayed multi-focal brain damage may exacerbate clinical symptoms in the chronic stage of stroke.
