After a wash-out period of four weeks 51 patients with mild to moderate senile dementia were treated with either 600 mg naftidrofuryl (n = 23) daily per os or placebo (n = 28) over an eight-week period. When classified according to Hachinski's score, 24 patients were found to be suffering from senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT), whereas 27 patients presented with vascular dementia (MID). During wash-out and the treatment period the somatic and social symptoms of the disease were assessed by the AGP score. Cerebral performance was evaluated by a battery of tests measuring memory, concentration, psychomotor coordination and degree of depression. Electrical activity of the brain was estimated by a power-spectral analysis of EEG. In the total study group, the naftidrofuryl group showed a significantly better improvement in the results of the psychometric test battery, which was the primary variable during treatment. A parallel development was to be found in the AGP score and electrical brain function. When results of subgroups were analyzed according to the etiopathogenetic background of patients with SDAT, it was possible to show that naftidrofuryl affected psychopathometry and EEG-parameters while patients with MID responded to naftidrofuryl with changes in AGP score and EEG variables. These findings indicate the importance of etiopathologic features in performing studies with nootropic drugs in obtaining information on possible different actions in patients with different kinds of senile dementia.
