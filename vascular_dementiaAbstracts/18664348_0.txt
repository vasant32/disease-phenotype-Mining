OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of scalp-acupuncture on intelligence in patients with vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: A total of 108 VaD patients were randomly divided into two groups: scalp-acupuncture group and Western medicine group. The scores of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Blesse Dementia Scale (BDS), Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS), Abilities of Daily Life (ADL) before and after treatment in the two groups were detected. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients completed the treatment. The scores of MMSE, BDS and HDS in the two groups were significantly increased, and the ADL scores significantly declined (P<0.05). There was no difference in the scores of MMSE, BDS, HDS and ADL between the two groups before and after the treatment. There was no difference in the total effectiveness between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Scalp-acupuncture therapy could improve the clinical intelligence level of VaD patients.
