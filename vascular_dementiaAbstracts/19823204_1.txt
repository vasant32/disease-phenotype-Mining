BACKGROUND: Patients with dementia are often unable to describe their pain because of memory deficiency and speech problems. This may lead to under-diagnosing and suboptimal pain treatment. The article summarises a thesis on development and testing of a new instrument for pain assessment: Mobilisation-Observation-Behavior-Intensity-Dementia (MOBID-2) pain scale. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 284 nursing home patients (with and without pain), who had been diagnosed with dementia of different types in various stages, were included in the study. Behaviour and intensity of pain was assessed during video-uptakes of clinical examinations and during regular morning care. Psychometric property testing included assessments of reliability, validity and clinical usefulness for the nursing home staff. RESULTS: Observation of pain behaviour during standardised and guided movements, by using the MOBID-2 Pain Scale, provides reliable and valid estimation of intensity of pain associated with the musculoskeletal-system. Pain that is not associated with the musculoskeletal-system is frequently observed, but more challenging to assess. Patients who have severe dementia and/or a combination of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, have a higher risk of suffering from severe and untreated pain than patients without dementia. INTERPRETATION: The MOBID-2 pain scale may help to ensure competent pain treatment, and should be available in all Norwegian nursing homes. A multidisciplinary approach is needed for its implementation and use. Physicians in nursing homes should reconsider the staff's observations, perform additional investigations and find the balance between effects and side effects of pain treatment.
