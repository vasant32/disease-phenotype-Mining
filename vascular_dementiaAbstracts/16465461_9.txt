Lipoproteins and vascular factors may play roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and/or vascular dementia (VaD). In this study, odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for apolipoprotein E (APOE), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and kallikrein (KLK1) polymorphisms were computed to test their association with the disease by a case-control study. The risk of AD was significantly increased for individuals with APOE varepsilon4 allele (OR = 3.73, 95% CI = 2.38-5.98). The risk of AD was also significant for people with ACE DD genotype, D allele, or T-D haplotype [OR (95% CI) = 4.29 (1.96-10.23), 1.90 (1.35-2.70), or 2.91 (1.71-5.10), respectively]. The above association between ACE-VaD was also strong (p = 0.0012, 0.0050, 0.0007, respectively). Reporter constructs containing the -240 A or T allele displayed similar transcriptional activity in both HEK-293 and IMR-32 cells. Thus, another putative pathogenic marker that is linked with the Alu D allele might affect the risk of AD and VaD in Taiwan.
