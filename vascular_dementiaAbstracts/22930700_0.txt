Studies on gender differences in the clinical manifestations of vascular dementia (VaD) are still lacking. In the present study, gender comparisons of cognitive and neuropsychiatric profiles were conducted separately for mild and moderate-to-severe VaD in a total of 467 patients with VaD. There were no significant gender differences in cognitive manifestations, except that females performed better on immediate verbal recall than males in mild stage. Women were more likely to exhibit delusions (15.5% vs 7.4%), hallucinations (9.5% vs 3.4%), and depression (43.1% vs 27.3%) in mild stage. The predominance of male patients was observed in apathy at moderate-to-severe stage (50.5% vs 34.8%). To conclude, gender differences existed in neuropsychiatric symptoms of VaD and were especially pronounced in mild stage. Delusions, hallucinations, and depression were more prevalent in females in mild VaD, with the male predominance only in apathy in the later stage.
