A 80-year-old in-patient with abnormal behaviors was strangulated in a hospital bed by another in-patient while he could not escape from the violence because of being restrained to the bed with safety belts. Neuropathological examination of the victim's brain showed characteristic pathological changes of Binswanger's disease (BD), a rare cause of dementia inducing abnormal behaviors. The authors methodically documented BD of the victim and at least justified the restraint as a preventive measure of his abnormal behaviors. Although the etiology of BD is unknown, immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein of the white matter lesions showed neither hyperplasia nor hypertrophy of astrocytes. This result suggested that astrocytes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of BD.
