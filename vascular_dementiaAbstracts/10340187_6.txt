AIM: This survey aims to study the medical, functional and social aspects of hospitalized elderly patients with dementia. METHODS: The case records of 100 patients with dementia admitted consecutively to our department were systematically reviewed to extract the patients' demographic data, presenting features, underlying cause(s) of dementia, functional disabilities and carers' difficulties. RESULTS: Eighty per cent of the patients were 75 years of age and above and 44% were males. In this cohort 55% had vascular dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being the next most common (40%). The overwhelming majority had marked cognitive impairment as assessed by the Abbreviated Mental Test and worsening degrees of dementia were significantly associated with increasing disabilities in both mobility and activities of daily living (ADL). Fifty-seven families reported coping difficulties and this group had significant correlations with the respective patients' bladder and bowel incontinence as well as worsening states of ambulatory and ADL function. CONCLUSION: Patients with dementia present with complex problems and management requires attention not only to patients' medical problems and rehabilitation strategies but also to education, emotional support and help for their frequently stressed out carers.
