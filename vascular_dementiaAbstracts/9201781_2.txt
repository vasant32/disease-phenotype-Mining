Urinary levels of alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1M) and of ulinastatin (UT) and the alpha 1M/UT ratio did not differ significantly between age-matched controls and patients with Parkinson's disease, and among subdivided groups based on Yahr's stages in Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, these indexes did not correlate with Yahr's stages. Although alpha 1M and UT levels did not correlate in patients with Parkinson's disease, a positive correlation was observed in the control group. The non-existence of a positive correlation between alpha 1M and UT levels distinguishes Parkinson's disease from other neuropsychiatric diseases such as dementia (Alzheimer-type and vascular dementia), schizophrenia and mood disorder.
