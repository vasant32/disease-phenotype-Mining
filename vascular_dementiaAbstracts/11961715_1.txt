OBJECTIVES: The enclosed paper tries to encompass the relatives of patients of three different geriatric groups diagnosed. It tries to establish the difference in care and which special factor influences each group concerning the burden of care. PATIENTS: Comparison of three groups: 1. Alzheimer-dementia, 2. vascular-dementia, 3. nondemented patients. RESULTS: It was found that it is mostly partners and children who are the carers in all three groups diagnosed. The social behaviour of the Alzheimer patient is the most stressful part of caring. The relatives of patients with vascular dementia are most stressed by disturbing behaviour and memory impairment and the relatives of the non dementia group by impaired mood and inadequate behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of care is the hardest for the relatives of the Alzheimer patients. For all three groups diagnosed the non cognitive symptoms are the main factor of the carers burden.
