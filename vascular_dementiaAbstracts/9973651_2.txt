We report two patients aged 65 and 61 years, who presented a subacute dementia with normal CT scan without contrast injection. Angiography showed a dural arteriovenous malformation. The patients improved dramatically with treatment of the malformation. Dementia was characterised by frontal dysfunction, emotional disorders, amnesic and praxic impairment. This neuropsychological pattern suggests a profile of global dementia in the field of vascular dementia.
