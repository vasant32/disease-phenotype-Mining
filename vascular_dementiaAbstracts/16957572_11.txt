OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between antihypertensive treatments and cognitive function in elderly hypertensive patients with memory complaints. METHODS: The association between cognitive function and antihypertensive drug therapy was studied in 1241 hypertensive elderly patients with memory complaints attending a geriatric outpatient clinic. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and validated neuropsychological tests (Cognitive Efficiency Profile; CEP). Patients were classified into four categories according to their cognitive status: normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD). RESULTS: In this population aged 78 +/- 8 years, with a mean blood pressure of 152 +/- 19/86 +/- 12 mmHg, antihypertensive treatment was prescribed for 57% of patients. After adjustment for age, sex and education, treated hypertensive patients had better cognitive function than untreated patients (MMSE score 23.9 +/- 5.6/30 versus 22.7 +/- 6.4/30, P < 0.001, CEP score 49.1 +/- 24.9/100 versus 45.4 +/- 23.7/100, P < 0.001). This association was observed independently of the cognitive status, both in normal, MCI, AD and VaD hypertensive patients. The odds ratio (OR) for AD was 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.81] in treated compared with untreated hypertensive patients. In patients on antihypertensive therapy, higher cognitive function was observed in patients using calcium antagonists compared with those without calcium antagonists (CEP 52.9 +/- 24.6/100 versus 46.4 +/- 23.4/100, P < 0.001; OR for AD 0.67; 95% CI 0.45-0.99), independently of blood pressure level. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive therapy was associated with a lower risk of cognitive impairment and AD. In particular, the use of calcium antagonists was associated with a decreased risk of cognitive impairment and AD independently of the blood pressure level, suggesting a specific neuroprotective effect of these antihypertensive agents.
