The authors previously reported that subcortical hyperintensity (SH) and whole-brain volume (WBV) each covary with different subscale scores of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) among vascular dementia (VaD) patients. The present longitudinal analysis examined these relationships for change. The authors found that SH volume increased and WBV decreased significantly over 12 months. At baseline, SH volume accounted for significant variance in MDRS total score and every subscale score, except Memory. WBV was unrelated to any MDRS measure. After 12 months, SH volume was related only to the Construction subscale score, whereas WBV accounted for the majority of variance in Attention and Memory subscale performance. These findings indicate that although SH volume increases with disease progression, the relative impact of SH volume on cognitive status decreases among patients with advanced VaD.
