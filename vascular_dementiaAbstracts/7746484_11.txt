Levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a glycolytic enzyme localized in neurons, were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with early-onset (e-AD) and late-onset (l-AD) Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia (VD) and controls. Mean CSF NSE levels in patients with Alzheimer's disease did not significantly differ from those in controls, although in the AD group a correlation was found between NSE levels and severity of cognitive deficits. In VD patients, CSF NSE was lower than in controls or in AD patients. These findings are of physiopathological interest but suggest that CSF NSE is not a useful biological marker in dementia disorders.
