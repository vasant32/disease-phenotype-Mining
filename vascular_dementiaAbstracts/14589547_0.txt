Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has facilitated diagnosis of Binswanger's disease in vivo, which has proven to be a more common disease entity than once believed. These patients generally present with hypertension, progressive dementia, hydrocephalus, gait difficulty, and personality change. A patient is presented with MRI findings of white-matter destruction and subcortical lesions, and with neuropsychological findings of higher-order cognitive impairment but selectively preserved language and visuospatial-perceptual skills. The relationship between the patient's cognitive-behavioral symptoms and the presence of disconnection syndrome is discussed. In addition, the utility of neuropsychological examination is reviewed. Finally, implications for differentiating cortical from subcortical dementia with psychometric test data are discussed.
