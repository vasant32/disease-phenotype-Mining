A matched case-control study (1:1) was carried out among 122 hospitalized patients with Binswanger's leukoencephalopathy to explore the possible risk factors of BE. Data collected were processed with conditional logistic regression analysis. Individual logistic analysis showed that family history of vascular dementia, history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIAs), cerebral ischemia, cerebral hemorrhage, renal disfunction, alcohol intake smoking were risk factors while healthy life style played protective effect. Body weight index, average family income, education level and type A behavior scores did not show close relations with BE. Multiple regression analysis showed that hypertension, TIAs, coronary heart disease, diabetes and family history of vascular dementia were independent risk factors.
