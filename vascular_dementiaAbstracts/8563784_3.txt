Computerized tomographic measures of recurrent cerebral infarctions, atrophy and local perfusion were all prospectively correlated with cognitive testing during treatment of risk factors plus antiplatelet therapy among vascular dementia patients. Neurological and cognitive status were quantified among 22 demented patients with small strokes and compared with 22 age-matched normal volunteers. In vascular dementia, risk factor control plus antiplatelet therapy reduced cerebral infarctions, increased perfusion, and stabilized or improved cognitive test performance, despite age-related, progressive cerebral atrophy.
