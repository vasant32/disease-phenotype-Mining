The burden of cognitive disorders is likely to increase over the coming years due to both increased longevity and altered risk factor patterns, arising from changes in lifestyle, healthcare and society. Vascular dementia with its underlying heterogeneous pathology, is a challenge for clinicians, and is frequently further aggravated by overlap with other neurodegenerative processes. Current Alzheimer's disease drugs have had limited clinical efficacy in treating vascular dementia and none have been approved by major regulatory authorities specifically for this disease. Moving forward, a valid choice may be a multimodal therapy, as has already been successfully proven in Alzheimer's disease. Actovegin, a hemodialysate derived from calf blood, has been shown to have effects on a variety of cellular processes and a recent experimental study has revealed its neuroprotective mechanisms of action. These data, coupled with positive results from clinical trials in mixed dementia populations, have served as a foundation for the design of a new trial investigating the efficacy and disease-modifying effects of Actovegin in post-stroke cognitive impairment.
