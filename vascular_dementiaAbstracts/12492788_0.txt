Vascular dementia (VaD) is a condition that involves deterioration in cognitive and non-cognitive areas. Although cognitive impairment is the defining symptom evaluated during clinical trials, changes in non-cognitive areas such as behavior, global functioning and activities of daily living are assessed because they assist in determining quality of life and overall well-being. Therapy has focused traditionally on preventing and controlling risk factors, as no approved treatments are currently available for these patients. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), the treatment of choice in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a potential treatment option for patients with VaD. Galantamine, an AChEI with nicotinic receptor modulation, has demonstrated clinically relevant benefits (cognition, global functioning, functional ability, behavior) in patients with either AD with cerebrovascular disease (AD with CVD) or probable VaD in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
