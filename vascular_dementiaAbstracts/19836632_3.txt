Inflammation is believed to play a pivotal role in dementia, but its role is still unclear. The aim of our study was to analyze the interplay among markers of inflammation, such as fibrinogen and high CRP levels, and dementia. First, we performed a cross-sectional study comparing markers of inflammation between 99 patients affected by dementia (mean age: 83.0+/-0.6 years) and 99 controls (mean age: 83.9+/-0.7 years). Then, we analyzed the relationship between inflammation and dementia in the same population composed by 34 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (mean age: 83.4+/-0.8 years), 64 vascular dementia (VaD) patients (mean age: 82.7+0.8 years) and 99 controls. Patients affected by dementia had higher CRP levels than controls (2.6+/-+/-0.2 vs. 0.7 + 0.1 p < 0.001, respectively). AD patients had higher CRP levels than VaD patients (4.2 + 0.6 vs. 1.7+/-0.2, p < 0.001, respectively). Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis showed that dementia (odds ratio=OR=4.965, 95% confidence interval=Cl=1.402-13.23, p=0.004), fibrinogen (OR=1.011, Cl=1.007-1.015, p<0.001), and age (OR=1.158, Cl=1.063-1.261, p<0.001) are independently correlated with high levels of CRP. The study suggests that inflammation may have a pathogenetic role in AD.
