Mini mental state tests (MMS) were administered to 227 adults over the age of 40 years living in an Ecuadorian urban Andean community known to be an endemic zone for Taenia solium taeniasis and cysticercosis. The overall prevalence of cognitive impairment was 8.4% (19/227). The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 23.5% (8 cases) in adults over 75 years (n=34). The Hachinski ischemic score for vascular dementia was abnormal in 4 of the 19 adults (21%) exhibiting cognitive impairment. This survey highlighted a high prevalence of dementia in comparison with industrialised countries. Parasitic encephalopathy that was present in one out of five persons in this Andean community could play a part in early damage of cognitive function.
