OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of Yuantong Capsule (YTC) in treating vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Eighty-three patients of VD were randomized on ratio of 2:1 into two groups, the 54 patients in the treated group were treated with YTC orally administered, 3 times a day, 1 capsule in each time. The remaining 29 patients in the control group were treated with Hydergine orally, 3 times a day, 2 mg in each time. The therapeutic course for both groups was 2 months. RESULTS: The therapeutic effect in the treated group was significantly better than that in the control group, significant difference (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) was shown in comparison of the two groups in terms of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and activity of daily living (ADL) test, symptoms scoring, total effective rate, and laboratory indexes findings. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of YTC in treating VD was obvious.
