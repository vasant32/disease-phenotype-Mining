In the study the prevalence of Alzheimer's type dementia and vascular dementia in the town of Swiebodzin and its surroundings was assessed. Also, the frequency of risk factors of vascular diseases for both types of dementia was evaluated. The study group comprised 7417 persons (45 years old and above). This population was divided into two groups. The younger subgroup (45-64 y) and the older one (65 y and above). The results obtained for indices of prevalence of both main types of dementia are comparable with the results that can be found in literature. The prevalence of Alzheimer's type dementia, in this study, is greater in women, while in men higher indices are referred to vascular dementia. The risk factors of cerebrovascular diseases are more frequent in the group of men. It could explain higher risk of vascular dementia in this group.
