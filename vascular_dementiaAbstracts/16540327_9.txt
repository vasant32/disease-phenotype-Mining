Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) both share significant vascular risk factors. The present study measures the haemodynamics of these diseases in absolute rather than relative terms. Twenty-four patients were classified as either early AD or VaD and were compared with 12 non-cognitively impaired subjects. Magnetic resonance imaging flow quantification was used to measure arterial inflow and arterial pulse volume. Mean vascular resistance and compliance were calculated. In AD, the arterial inflow was lower by 18%, resistance was higher by 23% and compliance of the arterial tree was lower by 20% compared with normal (p=0.01, 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). In VaD, the arterial pulse volume was higher by 24% and compliance was higher by 35% compared with normal (p=0.05 for both). Early VaD is characterized by normal blood flow, but increased pulsation. Reduced blood flow and an incompliant arterial tree characterize early AD.
