The present study attempts to find a correlation between low serum B-12 levels and dementias. A total of 178 patients of dementia were seen at the cognitive disorder clinic from 1996 to 1998. Serum B-12 levels were studied in 100 patients. 15 patients (39.5%) of Alzheimer's dementia had reduced B-12 levels, while only 5 patients (13.9%) with vascular dementias and 3 patients (11.5%) with other types of dementias had reduced levels. The incidence of low serum B-12 was statistically significant in the Alzheimer's group when compared with the other groups, individually as well as combined together (p<0.05). The aetiopathogenesis and significance of these findings is discussed and the literature is reviewed.
