To investigate the usefulness of the frontal assessment battery (FAB) as a brief assessment for diagnosis in patients with dementia, we examined cognitive function using the FAB, Mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Kana-hiroi test, and Raven's colored progressive matrices (RCPM). Subjects were 82 senile patients having amnesia as a complaint including 28 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 14 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 17 vascular dementia (VD), 13 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 10 healthy persons. We discussed the difference of scores in different types of dementia. In the FAB, the scores of healthy persons and MCI were much higher compared with the scores of all types of dementia. There were high correlation between FAB and MMSE, Kana-hiroi test, and RCPM. Although some subjects showed normal score in MMSE and/or RCPM, they showed low score in FAB. Based on this, FAB is efficient for the differential diagnosis of dementia as brief screening tool.
