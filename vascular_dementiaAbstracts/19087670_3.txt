OBJECTIVE: To investigate the plasma levels of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gasotransmitter, and homocysteine (Hcy) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and their role in the pathogenesis of AD and VD. METHODS: 31 AD patients, 28 VD patients, 20 CVD patients , and 23 normal controls (NC group) underwent examination of plasma concentrations of H2S and Hcy, mini mental state examination (MMSE), activity of daily living scale (ADL), Hachinski ischemic score (HIS) , and Hamilton's depression scale (HRSD). The severity of AD and VD was evaluated according to the global deterioration scale (GDS). RESULTS: (1) The plasma H2S levels of the AD, VD, and CVD patients were (34 +/- 7), (36 +/- 5), and (37 +/- 7) micromol/L respectively, all significantly lower than that of the NC group [(45 +/- 7) micromol/L, all P < 0.01]. However, there were no significant differences in the plasma H2S level among the AD, VD, and CVD patients (all P > 0.05). The plasma H2S concentration was negatively correlated the severity of AD. (2) The plasma Hcy levels of the AD, VD, and CVD patients were (14.0 +/- 3.0), (16.0 +/- 6.1), and (14.4 +/- 4.9) micromol/L respectively, all significantly higher than that of the NC group [(9.8 +/- 2.5) micromol/L, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the plasma Hcy level among these 3 groups (all P > 0.05). The plasma Hcy concentration was positively correlated with the severity of AD or VD. CONCLUSION: H2S and Hcy are both involved in the pathogenesis of AD, VD, and CVD, and its alteration in level may be associated with the severity of AD and VD.
