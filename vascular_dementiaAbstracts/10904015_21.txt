Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of death and disability in adults. Silent cerebral infarction (SCI) portends more severe cerebral infarctions or may lead to insidious progressive brain damage resulting in vascular dementia. This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of SCI in an apparently normal adult population. Nine hundred ninety-four consecutive symptom-free adults (mean age 49.0+/-7.7; men:women 830:164) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at the Center for Health Promotion at Samsung Medical Center were assessed. All were neurologically normal in history and physical examination. A total of 121 SCI lesions was observed in 58 subjects. The lesion prevalence adjusted for patient age was 5.1%. There was no gender difference in prevalence. Ninety-nine lesions were <1 cm in diameter, 15 were between 1 and 2 cm, 3 were between 2 and 3 cm, and 4 were >3 cm in diameter. The most frequent site of the SCI lesion was basal ganglia, after which the periventricular white matter, cerebral cortex, and thalamus were the most frequent sites. Old age, hypertension, a history of coronary artery disease, evidence of cardiomegaly in chest radiographs, and high fasting glucose/hemoglobin A1c levels were associated with SCI on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated old age and hypertension to be independent risk factors for SCI, and mild alcohol consumption was revealed as an independent protective factor against SCI.
