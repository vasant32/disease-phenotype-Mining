We investigated whether the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, could attenuate white matter lesions caused by chronic hypoperfusion in the rat, and whether suppression of oxidative stress is involved in the resulting neuroprotection. The ramipril treatment group showed significant protection from development of white matter lesions in the optic tract, the anterior commissure, the corpus callosum, the internal capsule and the caudoputamen. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the oxidized glutathione (GSSG)/total glutathione (GSH t) ratio was also significantly decreased in the ramipril group compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results suggest that ramipril can protect against white matter lesions that result from chronic ischemia due to its effects on free radical scavenging. Further efficacy should be studied in the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency states and vascular dementia.
