CT findings in 6 autopsy cases of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) are reported. A diffuse area of nonhomogeneous decreased density was observed in the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, together with moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles and ragged margins. The most characteristic pathological findings at autopsy were a diffuse area of incomplete infarction containing multiple small infarcts as well as cyst formation and marked stenotic atherosclerotic changes in the medullary arteries. Clinical features included patchy mental lapses, frontal-lobe syndromes, minor motor signs, and hypertension. The authors feel that SAE or a similar disease might occur in most cases of multi-infarct dementia.
