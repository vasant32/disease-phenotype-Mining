In 1898, Alzheimer wrote an exhaustive update on psychogeriatric issues. He discussed paralytic dementia, involutional melancholia, senile dementia, presenile dementia, arteriosclerotic dementia, Binswanger disease, stroke-induced dementia, and other dementias of vascular origin. In this paper, he appeared to describe his very first case of Alzheimer disease, he anticipated the ischemic score, and outlined his opinion about numerous issues of dementia research that are of current interest.
