The authors studied 13 autopsy brains from a larger cohort of 270 African-Americans with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), or stroke without dementia. Two subjects exhibited changes of pure VaD, 5 had pure AD, and 6 showed a mixture of AD pathology and strokes. Overall, there was good agreement between the pathologic diagnoses and the clinical diagnoses.
