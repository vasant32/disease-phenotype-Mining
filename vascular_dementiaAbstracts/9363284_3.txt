Despite its importance and widespread usage, the term mixed dementia, referring to the coexistence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VsD), has been ill-defined and poorly conceptualized. The authors review the use of the term mixed dementia in neuropathological and clinical research. As a result of recent developments in the categorization of dementias, they recommend discarding the term mixed dementia in favor of a more precise terminology based on AD and VsD concurrently meeting established criteria for each diagnosis.
