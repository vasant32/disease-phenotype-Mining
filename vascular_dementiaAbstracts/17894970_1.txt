Antiphospholipid Antibodies (aPAs) are specific circulating immunoglobulins that lead to a hypercoagulant state and recurrent arterial and venous thromboembolic events. The cerebral circulation is the most common site of arterial occlusion in aPAs, and neurologic events include amaurosis fugax, migrainous cephalalgia, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, ischemic encephalopathy, and vascular dementia. A review of the literature yields numerous studies citing neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with this syndrome in a much younger population than is seen in other cerebrovascular disorders. These associated features include focal and generalized cognitive deficits, early-onset vascular dementia, and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as affective and thought disorders. These neurocognitive and neurobehavioral manifestations may be underemphasized in this population and aPAs should be considered in a differential diagnosis. Largescale prospective studies are needed to quantify psychiatric and neuropsychological sequelae of this disorder.
