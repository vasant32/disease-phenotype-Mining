BACKGROUND: The Memory Disturbances Center is a multidisciplinary team devoted to the study and treatment of patients with memory problems. AIM: To report the clinical features of patients consulting to this center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical records of the first 100 patients consulting in the center. RESULTS: The age of consulting patients ranged from 17 to 93 years and 57 were female. The most common diagnoses were Alzheimer disease, depressive pseudo dementia, mild cognitive impairment, vascular dementia and adult attention deficit disorder. A formal neuropsychological assessment was performed in 60% and 20% entered a cognitive stimulation program. CONCLUSIONS: Although Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of memory disorders in the adult, concealed depression and attention deficit disorders are also common. A multidisciplinary approach allows a better diagnosis and treatment.
