We report the case of a 76 year old woman who presented with a clinical picture initially typical of a vascular dementia. The diagnosis was revised to Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease in the terminal stages. While Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease is rare, one must consider it in the differential diagnosis as it can mimic other dementias particularly in the chronic form which we describe here.
