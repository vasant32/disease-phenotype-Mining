We prospectively investigated 131 consecutive cases (both in- and outpatients) of suspected dementia to evaluate the relative frequency of different types of dementia in Chinese patients. Dementia was confirmed in 110 cases (84.0%). In contrast to the Western series, vascular dementia (39.1%) was slightly more frequent than the Alzheimer's disease (36.4%). Twelve cases (10.9%) of potentially treatable dementia were found. Careful clinical observation was the most useful part of the evaluation. CT scan of brain was the most useful laboratory test.
