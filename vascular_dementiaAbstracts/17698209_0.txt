Procalcitonin (PCT) is an established marker for severe systemic bacterial infection and sepsis in blood. Here we measured PCT by immunoassay in CSF and matched serum/plasma samples of controls and patients with different primary dementia disorders and acute neuroinflammation. PCT in CSF was significantly increased in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia and acute neuroinflammation (encephalitis, meningitis) compared to non-demented controls. In contrast, PCT levels in matched plasma samples were normal in dementia groups, but elevated in meningitis/encephalitis. Our results indicate a central production of PCT and suggest PCT as a valuable marker candidate for the monitoring of dementia and acute neuroinflammation.
