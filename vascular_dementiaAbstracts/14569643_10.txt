Subcortical vascular dementia (VaD) is characterized by executive dysfunction and behavioral problems, reflecting deterioration of the frontal lobe. This study aimed to determine whether rivastigmine, a dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl-cholinesterase (BuChE), has any effects on the typical symptoms of subcortical VaD. Patients receiving rivastigmine showed a slight improvement in executive functions and in behavior. Side effects in both groups were tolerable and there were no study withdrawals. Moreover, there are no drug interactions with other therapies previously and concomitantly assumed. Improvements in domains that characterize subcortical VaD were observed, indicating that rivastigmine may have provided targeted treatment in areas of the brain that are particularly affected in this patient population.
