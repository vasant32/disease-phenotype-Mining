The histotopography of metal contents was studied in brains from cases with arteriosclerotic dementia by means of laser spectrography, a technique which is both highly secific and sensitive. All the affected brains contained considerable amounts of calcium which was present in almost all brain regions. The quantitative evaluation showed twice as much calcium in the striatum relative to the cerebellar white matter.
