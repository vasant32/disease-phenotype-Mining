BACKGROUND: The modulation of attention by emotionally arousing stimuli is highly important for each individual's social function. Disturbances of emotional processing are a supportive feature for the diagnosis of subcortical vascular dementia (SVD). We address here whether these disturbances might be useful as an early disease marker. METHODS: In order to examine the modulation of visual attention by emotionally arousing stimuli of different valence, 12 elderly patients with early SVD, 12 age-comparable healthy adults and 12 young healthy subjects were studied while looking at pairs of pictures from the International Affective Picture Battery that were either neutral-neutral, neutral-positive or neutral-negative in terms of emotional content. Eye movements were recorded with an infrared eye-tracking system. The direction of the first saccade and the dwell time during the 10 s of presentation were measured and compared among groups with parametric tests. RESULTS: All subjects showed a modulation of initial attentional orienting as well as a higher percentage of dwell time towards the pictures containing emotional material. Patients with SVD and old controls did not differ in either experimental measure. Young patients showed a stronger bias towards emotionally negative material than both groups of older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of visuospatial attention is preserved in early SVD. This might have implications for therapeutic interventional approaches. A weakened sustained attention towards negative but not positive emotional pictures in the elderly is in accordance with the socioemotional selectivity theory, describing a relative selection of positive stimuli with aging.
