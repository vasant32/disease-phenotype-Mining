Subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy is a chronic vascular dementia with hydrocephalus characterized clinically by: (i) subacute focal neurological deficit; (ii) acute strokes; (iii) dementia; (iv) motor signs and pseudobulbar palsy; (v) hydrocephalus; (vi) persistent hypertension and systemic vascular disease; and (vii) a lengthy course. The pathogenesis is most probably ischaemic change related to subacute hypertensive encephalopathy. The pathological changes include severe central nervous system disease characterized by loss of white matter with gliosis, and arterial and arteriolar sclerosis of small penetrating cerebral blood vessels. The differential diagnosis includes vascular pseudobulbar palsy, multi-infarct dementia and senile dementia (Alzheimer's disease). Treatment includes blood pressure control as well as management of other factors known to affect vascular disease (diabetes mellitus).
