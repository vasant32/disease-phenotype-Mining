160 patients over 60 years of age appealed to gerontologic unit of out-patient psychiatric clinic for the first time. The patients were divided into two main groups: with organic mental disorders (OMD) and with functional mental disorders (FMD) (79 and 81 patients, respectively). In the group of OMD the main form of disturbances were cases with dementia (74.4%) mainly of the Alzheimer's type, and cerebral vascular dementia. In 25.3% of the patients the cognitive disturbances didn't attain the level of dementia. In a group of patients with different forms of dementia a high frequency of comorbid mental pathology was observed (83%)--confusional states, delusions, depressive conditions as well as disturbed behavior (67.7%) that was one of the reasons for consulting a psychiatrist. In FMD group the prevailing pathology were depressions, both of the major (37.1%) and mild (34.6%) forms. The remaining cases were characterized by delusions (10.1%), anxiety-phobic (7.6%) states and somatoform disturbances (5.1%). Among the patients both of OMD and FMD groups it was possible to diagnose approximately 3-4 different somatic diseases; vascular and gastrointestinal disorders were met more frequently. The study of contribution of brain computer tomography (CT) to diagnosis of mental pathology (according to ICD-10), has demonstrated that in 30.8% of the cases it was decisive, in 41% it confirmed the clinical data and in 21.8% CT provide additional data (detecting latent cerebral vascular damage). And only in 6.4% of the cases CT fails to give definite information in diagnostically complicated cases. In 26.6% of the patients with FMD, CT of brain had detected symptoms of mild vascular pathology.
