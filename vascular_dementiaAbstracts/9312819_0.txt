1987-1993 the Zurich prospective dementia study examined twice yearly 308 nursing-home patients: 192 with senile dementia of Alzheimer-type, 18 with Parkinsonism, 20 with Parkinson dementia and 78 controls, with the Zurich variant of the mini-mental state and rated their dementia state by CDR, activities of daily living with ADL and social behavior with an SVS-scale. At the end of the study or at death the average age was 86.2 years (range 63-103 and 159 autopsies were performed which confirmed the clinical diagnoses at least partly in 70%. Of the 62 cases with autopsies who had been studied more than two years 25 showed M.Alzheimer, 8 M, Parkinson, 7 vascular dementia and 13 a combination of those three diagnoses 40% of these Alzheimer patients exhibited no deterioration in the SVS for two years, 40% respectively 30% during one, resp. two years in the CDR, 20% resp. 40% in the ADL and 23% resp. 5% in the MMS. This demonstrates that good nursing-home care can stabilize behaviour and to a lesser extent even cognitive abilities of a large minority of patients with a pathologically confirmed progressive dementing illness.
