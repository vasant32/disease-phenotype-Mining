Contrast sensitivity has been shown to be affected in Alzheimer's disease (Ad). We investigated low contrast acuity and contrast sensitivity using clinical test charts in this patient population. Additionally, we tested patients with vascular dementia (vd) and mixed dementia (md), (Alzheimer' with vascular dementia). Contrast sensitivity was assessed using the Vistech VCTS 6500 test chart. Low contrast acuity was measured using the Regan charts at four contrast levels (96%, 50%, 25% and 11%). The patient population consisted of 19 Ad patients, 9 vd patients and 10 md patients. Reduction in acuity was found with contrast level in all cases. Regression lines were fit to the data and statistical analysis was performed. We did not find a statistically significant difference between the Ad and vd or md groups. We did, however, find a difference between the vd and md groups. We did find reduction in contrast sensitivity at all spatial frequencies when compared to the elderly normal. Correspondingly, we found a significant difference in acuity when compared with normal data at the four contrast levels tested. Acuity is reduced with contrast in all patient groups. Our contrast sensitivity results are similar to those reported in the literature. This study points out the importance of using simple clinical test charts and further underscores the idea that there is a primary visual deficit in Ad.
