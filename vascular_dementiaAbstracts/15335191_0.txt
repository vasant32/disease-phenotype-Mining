We report a case of a 77-year-old man with deteriorating dementia caused by repeated multiple small cerebral embolisms from a thoracic aortic atheroma. Multiple small embolisms were confirmed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). The patient ultimately died due to aortic dissection. Pathological examinations revealed that no causative embolic source for multiple embolisms could be detected other than severe atheromatous ulcer in thoracic aorta. This case demonstrates that severe aortic atheroma has the potential to precipitate deterioration of vascular dementia.
