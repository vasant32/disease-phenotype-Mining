Efficacy of neuromidin was studied in 62 patients with a small ischemic stroke and cognitive disorders. Patients of the main group received neuromidin as an add-on to basic treatment and patients of the comparison group received only basic treatment (antiaggregant, antihypertensive, cardiac and antidiabetic drugs with the exclusion of nootropic and psychotropic medications). The decrease of subjective complaints, improvement of memory, attention, abstract and practical reasoning assessed by neuropsychological tests were seen in 32 patients of the main group after the end of treatment course. Neuromidin did not cause side-effects and was well tolerated. The long use of this led to the reduction of cognitive impairment, a predictor of vascular dementia.
