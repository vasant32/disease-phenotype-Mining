The P300 component of evoked potential can reflect cognitive state in dementia patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of P300 as an indicator of cognition in Binswanger's disease (BD) and to explore the possible causes of dementia in BD patients. P300 was measured at Cz site in 21 patients with BD and 21 controls matched with age, sex, handedness, and education. This measurement included P300 latency and amplitude. All patients were also given WAIS-RC test and scanned with computerized tomography (CT), and were treated with hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO). The relationships among P300, CT and WAIS-RC score were studied. BD patients had significantly prolonged P300 latency and a tendency of low amplitude P300, but the amplitude difference was not significant compared with controls. P300 latency was found to be negatively correlated with WARS-RC scale, and positively correlated with the change of white matter low attenuation (WMLA). WMLA was also correlated with WAIS-RC score. Treatment with HBO reduced P300 latency and had effect on the cognitive part of P300 but had no effect on CT changes. The significant association between neurophysiological and neuropsychological measurement suggests that P300 measurement reflects a disrupted aspect of cognitive function in BD patients, and it may be a useful means to assess the degree of subcortical cognitive deterioration and the effect of therapy. White matter lesion in BD is concerned to the occurrence of dementia by disturbing axonal conduction.
