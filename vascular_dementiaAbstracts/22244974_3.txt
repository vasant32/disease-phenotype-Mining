There is strong evidence that vascular risk factors play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (vaD). Ethanol (EtOH) and cholesterol are such vascular risk factors, and we recently showed that hypercholesterolemia causes pathologies similar to AD [Ullrich et al. (2010) Mol Cell Neurosci 45, 408-417]. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term (12 months) EtOH treatment (20% v/v in drinking water) alone or long-term 5% cholesterol diet alone or a combination (mix) in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Long-term EtOH treatment (plasma EtOH levels 58Â±23 mg/dl) caused significant impairment of spatial memory, reduced the number of choline acetyltransferase- and p75 neurotrophin receptor-positive nucleus basalis of Meynert neurons, decreased cortical acetylcholine, elevated cortical monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tissue-type plasminogen activator, enhanced microglia, and markedly induced anti-rat immunoglobulin G-positive blood-brain barrier leakage. The effect of long-term hypercholesterolemia was similar. Combined long-term treatment of rats with 20% EtOH and 5% cholesterol (mix) did not potentiate treatment with EtOH alone, but instead counteracted some of the EtOH-associated effects. In conclusion, our data show that vascular risk factors EtOH and cholesterol play a role in cognitive impairment and possibly vaD.
