To analyze the status of risk factors for post-stroke vascular dementia, 128 patients with post-stroke dementia, aged from 50-79 years, have been studied. A control group included 125 patients, aged 50-79 years, with moderate cognitive impairment after stroke. A coronary heart disease was a significant risk factor for the patients aged from 50-59; coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, overweight and hyperlipidemia were significant risk factors for the aged 60-69, diabetes mellitus, overweight and hyperlipidemia were significant risk factors for the aged 70-79. The stroke-related factors were cerebral infarction in left hemisphere, frontal and temporo-occipital infarction, thalamic, basal ganglion; cerebral white-matter lesions. The mathematical model of post-stroke dementia prediction was created for patients with post-stroke moderate cognitive impairment.
