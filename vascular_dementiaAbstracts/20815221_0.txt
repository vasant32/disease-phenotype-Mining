OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Ruiqi tablet on mitochondrion activities in the cerebral cortex neurons of fetal mice. METHOD: The cerebral cortex of fetal Wistar rats after 16- 17 gestation days were collected and randomized into Ruiqi tablet group and blank control group after 4-5 days' culture. Laser scanning confocal microscope was adopted to determine the changes in the mitochondrion activities of the primary cultured cerebral cortex neurons of fetal rats after addition of Ruiqi tablet solution. RESULT: Ruiqi tablet can increase the mitochondrion activities of the cerebral cortex neurons. No significant change in the mitochondrion activities of the cerebral cortex neurons was found in the blank control group. CONCLUSION: Ruiqi tablet can increase the mitochondrion activities of the neurons and it has certain application prospects in treatment of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease and so on.
