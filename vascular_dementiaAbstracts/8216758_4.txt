Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of 22 amino acids were studied in 13 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), 13 patients with vascular dementia (VD) and 15 age-matched controls. We found significantly reduced levels of glutamate in CSF samples from DAT patients compared to VD and control subjects, but CSF levels of aspartate were found to be significantly elevated in the two groups of dementia studied. Moreover, CSF concentrations of tyrosine, leucine and phenylalanine were significantly increased in VD patients in comparison with those in DAT patients and control subjects. Our results showed a wide increase in CSF/serum amino acid ratios in DAT and VD groups compared to controls. However, no differences were found in CSF/serum ratios between dementia groups. These changes show evidence for a possible disorder of amino acid metabolism with different patterns in these two dementia types.
