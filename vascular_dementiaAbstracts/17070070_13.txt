Small-vessel disease or cerebral microangiopathy is a common finding in elderly people leading finally to subcortical ischemic vascular dementia. Because cerebral microangiopathy impairs vascular reactivity and affects mainly the frontal lobes, we hypothesized that brain activation decreases during an event-related color-word matching Stroop task. 12 patients suffering from cerebral microangiopathy were compared with 12 age-matched controls. As an imaging method we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy, because it is particularly sensitive to the microvasculature. The Stroop task led to activations in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Generally, the amplitude of the hemodynamic response was reduced in patients in tight correlation with behavioral slowing during the Stroop task and with neuropsychological deficits, namely attentional and executive dysfunction. Interestingly, patients showed an early deoxygenation of blood right after stimulation onset, and a delay of the hemodynamic response. Whereas the amplitude of the hemodynamic response is reduced in the frontal lobes also with normal aging, data suggest that impairments of neurovascular coupling are specific for cerebral microangiopathy. In summary, our findings indicate frontal dysfunction and impairments of neurovascular coupling in cerebral microangiopathy.
