We examined patterns of early and late word generation in category and letter fluency among persons in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). The sample consisted of 20 preclinical VaD persons, 66 preclinical AD persons, and 267 control persons, sampled from the community. Persons in the preclinical phase of AD and VaD were similarly impaired in letter fluency, although the preclinical VaD group outperformed their AD counterparts in category fluency. This pattern of results is consistent with the notion that category fluency is relatively more dependent on the medial-temporal lobe, whereas letter fluency relies more on frontal regions. The patterns of fluency impairment in preclinical AD and VaD generalized across early and late word retrieval.
