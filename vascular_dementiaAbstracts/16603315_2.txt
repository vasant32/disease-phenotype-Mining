Sequence variants of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D), angiotensinogen (AGT) T235M, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) A1166C, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G were analyzed to see their genetic associations with vascular dementia as its candidate genetic risk factors involving renin-angiotensin and fibrin systems. While the ACE I/D, AT1R A1166C, and PAI-1 4G/5G did not contribute to the genetic susceptibility to vascular dementia (P>0.05), a significant association with vascular dementia was shown in the T235M polymorphism of AGT. The frequency of the M allele in patients was higher than in controls with the odds ratio (OR) estimate of 1.51 (P<0.05). In a dominant model, the TM+MM genotypes increased the risk of vascular dementia compared to the TT genotype (OR=2.01; P<0.001). The current results suggested that AGT T235M polymorphism might be a risk factor of vascular dementia.
