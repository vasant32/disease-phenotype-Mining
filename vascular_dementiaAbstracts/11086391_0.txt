The autonomic nerve activity was evaluated in cases of Binswanger's encephalopathy by power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability during supine rest and standing upright, in order to elucidate the role of autonomic nervous system function in the pathophysiology of Binswanger's encephalopathy. There was no difference in the ratio of low frequency (LF) power to high frequency (HF) power (L/H ratio), which reflects cardiac sympathetic nerve activity in each position among Binswanger's encephalopathy, control and lacunar stroke. Binswanger's encephalopathy had significantly lower HF power, which reflects cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity, than control and lacunar stroke in a supine rest, and HF power did not respond to standing. Moreover, there was no difference in HF power between mild cases and severe cases of Binswanger's encephalopathy, and L/H ratio decreased in severe cases during standing. These results suggest that cardiac parasympathetic nervous system function is impaired in the early stage of Binswanger's encephalopathy, then cardiac sympathetic nervous system dysfunction occurs with advancing the disease stage.
