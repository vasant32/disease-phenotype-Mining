Difference in genetic makeup of lipid metabolizing proteins may increase susceptibility to dementia. The aim of this study was to investigate variations in two lipid metabolizing genes, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein gene (LRPAP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE), in vascular and degenerative dementias. This hospital-based association study included 147 patients with dementia and 163 age-matched controls. Genotyping for LRPAP1 intron 5 insertion/deletion and APOEHhaI polymorphism was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The frequency of DD genotype and *D allele of LRPAP gene was high in degenerative dementias compared with controls (76.6% vs. 44.8% and 86.4% vs. 69.3%, respectively) suggesting increased susceptibility [P < 0.0001, odds ratio (OR) =3.76 for DD genotype and P < 0.0001, OR = 2.80 for D allele]. Vascular dementia patients showed statistically insignificant but increasing trend for allele I (40.0% vs. 30.7%). We also observed significant association of APOEepsilon4 allele with degenerative dementias (P < 0.0001, OR =5.35). Our study suggests that LRPAP1-D and APOE E4 alleles significantly increase the susceptibility to degenerative dementias.
