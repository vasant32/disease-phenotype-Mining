The most frequently diagnosed dementia diseases include Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and dementia with Lewy bodies. Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine are currently recommended as first line drugs for the treatment of AD. These anti-dementia drugs have not yet been approved for the treatment of VD and DLB although the results of controlled clinical studies support the effectiveness of the ChE inhibitors for both diseases. The treatment of the primary disease and the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular accidents constitute the primary objectives of VD therapy. Although single or multiple domain cognitive deficits are the clinical key symptoms of dementia, noncognitive psychopathological symptoms (so-called behavioral disorders) are particularly common and may even dominate the clinical course in the moderate to severe stages. Therefore, it is important to recognize, diagnose and specifically treat these additional symptoms. During the last decade, the classic neuroleptics and benzodiazepine have been largely replaced by modern antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazepine analogues.
