OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between cognitive and behavioral impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to examine whether the addition of cerebrovascular disease modifies that relationship. DESIGN: Correlational analysis. SETTING: An outpatient dementia clinic. PATIENTS: An autopsy-confirmed series of 28 patients with AD and 16 patients with mixed Alzheimer and vascular dementia (MIX). MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological and behavioral tests during life: Mini-Mental State (MMS), Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS), Haycox Dementia Behavior Scale (HDBS), and two non-cognitive functional scales derived from the BDS and HDBS. RESULTS: In the AD group, MMS scores correlated significantly with scores on the BDS, HDBS, and two non-cognitive functional scales. In the MIX group, however, no significant relationship was observed between MMS scores and scores on any of the behavioral measures. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that in AD, cognitive and behavioral impairments progress simultaneously. However, with the addition of a vascular component to the dementing process, cognitive and behavioral impairments may progress more independently.
