Problems in the literature in the appraisal of brain deep white-matter changes are considered. The identification of the changes with Binswanger's disease alone is rejected, and evidence is reviewed that demonstrates that they are associated with cognitive impairment and, to some extent, with vascular disease. Possible causes of white-matter changes and their relationships to Alzheimer's disease are examined, and it is argued that a neutral term, exact enough to define white-matter changes, sufficient as a description or label, and demanding enough to require precise clinical and imaging descriptions is needed. We suggest herein the term "leuko-araiosis" on the basis of Greek etymology and Hippocratic usage.
