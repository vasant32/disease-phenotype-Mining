Using diagnostic criteria from the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, dementia was clinically diagnosed in 57 (62%) of 92 centenarians living in two northern Italian provinces. The condition was severely disabling in approximately 70% of the demented patients. Although clinically diagnosed AD accounted for 79% of dementia cases, almost one third of patients with AD had risk factors for vascular dementia, suggesting that the aging brain may be susceptible to multiple additive factors that impair cognition.
