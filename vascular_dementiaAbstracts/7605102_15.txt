Neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites are characteristic pathological features found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A major constituent of these lesions is the cytoskeletal protein tau. This study examined whether the measurement of tau in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) has value in the diagnosis of AD. Seventy-seven subjects were enrolled in this prospective study: These included AD (N = 24), Neurological Controls (dementing diseases/syndromes, N = 26), Normal Controls (N = 14), and Others (N = 13). CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture, and tau concentrations (pg/mL) were determined using a dual monoclonal antibody microplate immunoassay. The mean tau value for AD subjects (1,430 +/- 739) was significantly different from Neurological Control subjects (790 +/- 579) (p < 0.001) and Normal Control subjects (816 +/- 355) (p < 0.001). Tau values were elevated in two Neurological Control subjects, one with Binswanger's disease (age 75) and one with depression (age 90). Tau values were also elevated in three Normal Control subjects; two were subjects with a family history of AD. Tau concentrations did not correlate significantly with age in AD subjects (r = 0.05, p = 0.82) or in Normal Control subjects (r = -0.49, p = 0.08). Tau also did not correlate with severity of cognitive impairment in AD subjects (r = -0.03, p = 0.91) or duration of AD symptoms (r = 0.16, p = 0.52). Based on these results and others, CSF levels of tau protein may provide a useful biochemical marker to aid in the clinical diagnosis of AD.
