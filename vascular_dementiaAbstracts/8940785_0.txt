BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 is known to exist in the nervous system. A notable increase of plasma endothelin-1 is associated with acute stroke. This study was designed to measure plasma endothelin-1 levels in Binswanger's disease and explore the relationship between endothelin-1 and this disorder. METHODS: Plasma levels of endothelin-1 were-examined by radioimmunoassay in 31 patients with Binswanger's disease and in three groups of control subjects. The ratio of the plasma concentration of endothelin-1 in the internal jugular vein to that in the antecubital vein was calculated as an indicator of endothelin-1 level in cerebral circulation. RESULTS: Endothelin-1 ratio devation was seen more often in patients with Binswanger's disease than in acute stroke patients. Endithelin-1 ratios were significantly negatively correlated with Hasegawa's Dementia Scale scores is subjects with Binswanger's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities is vasoactive factors may make an important contribution to the pathophysiology of Binswanger's disease. Endothelin-1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of this illness.
