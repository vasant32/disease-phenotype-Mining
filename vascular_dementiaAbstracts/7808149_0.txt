Interest in Binswanger's disease has increased during the past decade, owing to the possibility of detecting white matter changes with computerised and magnetic resonance tomography. This paper consists in a summary of clinical symptoms and signs and possible diagnostic criteria, discussion of differential diagnosis, and the presentation of two own cases. Both patients manifested mild dementia and gait disturbance, and one had frequent drop attacks. Severe supra- and infra-tentorial white matter changes were present in both cases. It is important to consider a possible diagnosis of Binswanger's disease, as treatment of the appropriate risk factors may prevent or delay the development of dementia.
