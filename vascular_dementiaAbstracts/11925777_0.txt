Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most frequent neuropathologically diagnosed degenerative dementing illness. The clinical characteristics are progressive dementia, Parkinson syndrome, fluctuations of cognitive functions, vigilance and attention, visual hallucinations (usually detailed and well described), depression, REM-sleep behavior disorder, adverse responses to standard doses of neuroleptics, falls, syncopes, systematized delusions, and non-visual hallucinations. Mean age at disease onset ranges between 60 and 68 years. Male persons are more frequently affected than female. Disease duration is six to seven years. The differential diagnoses of DLB are dementia of the Alzheimer-type, Parkinson's disease, subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, and, in rare cases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The genetic background of the disease is unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission tomography can contribute to the diagnosis. The disease is treated with L-dopa, atypical neuroleptics, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, antihypotensive agents, and peripheral anticholinergic and alpha-receptor-blocking medicaments to improve neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
