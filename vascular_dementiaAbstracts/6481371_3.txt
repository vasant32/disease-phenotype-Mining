Short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from 54 patients with dementia as compared to 32 age-matched controls. SEPs were generally normal in patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type, while patients with multi-infarct dementia showed a prolonged central conduction time, an increased latency of both N13 and N20 and a reduction of the primary cortical response amplitude. These findings suggest that recording SEPs may be useful in the differential diagnosis between degenerative dementia and multi-infarct dementia.
