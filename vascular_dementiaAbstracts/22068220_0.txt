The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between neurologic signs and cognitive dysfunction in subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). 121 patients with SIVD were recruited from multiple nationwide hospitals. The patients' neurologic signs were evaluated using the Focal Neurologic Sign Score (FNSS). The FNSS scores did not correlate with the composite neuropsychology scores and Korean Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The FNSS scores correlated with the letter fluency and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) copy scores. Using a multivariate regression analysis controlled for age, sex, and educational level, the FNSS scores had a significant relationship with the letter fluency test scores (R (2) = 0.08, β = -2.28, p = 0.02) and ROCF copy scores (R (2) = 0.08, β = -0.42, p = 0.03). These findings suggest that the neurologic signs in patients with SIVD do not correlate with global cognitive functions; however, these signs do correlate with executive dysfunction in these patients.
