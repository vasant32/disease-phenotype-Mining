One hundred and sixteen elderly female in-patients with confirmed diagnoses of senile or arteriosclerotic dementia were tested on the Paired-Associate Learning Test (PALT) and Cognitive Assessment Scale (CAS) of CAPE and were followed up annually for six years. Comparison of those patients who had died by each follow-up date with those who had survived showed that in general the latter had had better PALT and CAS scores.
