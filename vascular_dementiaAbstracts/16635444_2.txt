Vascular cognitive impairment encompasses a spectrum of clinically defined syndromes ranging from vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia, to vascular dementia. The underlying cerebrovascular pathology includes both overt infarction as well as rarefaction of gray and white matter. Alzheimer's pathology may coexist with vascular pathology. Diagnosis rests on identifying acquired cognitive impairment in the setting of documented cerebrovascular disease, based on clinical presentation and neuroimaging; MRI is more sensitive than CT. The course can be stepwise or gradually progressive. The clinical picture is typically dominated by deficits in executive function rather than the short-term memory deficit typical of Alzheimer's disease. No specific therapies exist, but treatment with anticholinesterase agents and N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists may result in clinical improvement. Prevention remains paramount, with early recognition of populations at risk and early and aggressive management of risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use as well as antithrombotic therapy, in appropriate populations.
