The authors determined the prevalence of dementia in 338 (response rate 65%) 95-year-old persons, living in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden, and compared the result with a previously examined population sample of 85 year olds. The prevalence of dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd rev. ed) was higher in women (55%) than in men (37%) at age 95, and the proportion of mild dementia and vascular dementia was lower in 95 than in 85 year olds.
