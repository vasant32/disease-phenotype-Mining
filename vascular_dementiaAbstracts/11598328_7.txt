Although leuko-araiosis is a common finding on computed tomographic (CT) scans of the brain, its pathogenesis remains uncertain. To investigate the association between blood pressure (BP) disturbances and leuko-araiosis, we retrospectively reviewed CT scans and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitorings of 79 elderly patients (57 women and 22 men; mean age: 83.3 +/- 6.4 years). Of the 79 patients, 50 were demented (30 had Alzheimer's disease and 18 vascular dementia) and 29 were not demented. The leuko-araiosis score (LA score) was determined by using Rezek's scale. To evaluate short-term variation of BP, we determined (1) the variability of systolic and diastolic BPs (SBP, DBP; within-subject standard deviation of all readings over a 24-hour period), (2) the coefficient of variability (variability of BP/mean BP) and (3) the maximal variation of BP (difference between the maximum and minimum 24-hour BPs). Higher LA scores were associated with higher SBPs in 24-hour, diurnal and nocturnal periods, higher maximal variation of SBP, greater variability of SBP during 24-hour, diurnal and nocturnal periods and greater coefficient of variability of SBP during sleep. Our study suggests that elevations and short-term variations of SBP may contribute to the pathogenesis of white matter lesions in elderly persons.
