 AIM: To observe the cAMP and adenylyl cyclase (AC) mRNA level in hippocampus of mice with vascular dementia (ischemia/reperfusion), and explore the molecular pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS: The mice were subjected for ischemia/reperfusion three times on bilateral common carotid arteries by knots to establish models of ischemia/reperfusion and the changes of learning and memory were tested on 29 d/30 d after operation. Sham-operation mice were introduced as control group. The cAMP level was evaluated by the radioimmunoassay (RIA), AC mRNA positive neurons of hippocampus CA1 area were dyed through in-situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: Compared with sham-operation group, the learning and memory of model group was worse (P < 0.05), the cAMP level in hippocampus was lower (P < 0.05) and the surface density (Sv) of AC mRNA positive neurons reduced (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The lower cAMP and AC mRNA level in hippocampus might participate in the molecular pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion.
