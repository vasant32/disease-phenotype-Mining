In order to verify the association of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene with different kinds of dementia, as well as its association with APO-E (genotype), we performed ACE genotyping in subjects with late-onset probable Alzheimer's disease (LOAD, n = 64), early-onset probable Alzheimer's disease (EOAD, n = 32), possible Alzheimer's disease (pAD, n = 44), vascular dementia (VD, n = 12), age-associated memory impairment (AAMI, n = 15) and 40 healthy age-matched controls, who were previously characterized for APO-E. After the principal component analysis ACE D and Apo-Eepsilon4 alleles disclosed the highest prevalence in the cognitively impaired groups of subjects, Apo-Eepsilon4 being more specific for LOAD and pAD. ACE D allele seems to be an unspecific susceptibility factor for mental decline.
