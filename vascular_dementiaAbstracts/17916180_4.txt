This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between plasma fibrinogen level and risk for cognitive decline and dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Elderly patients with suspected cognitive impairment were screened and evaluated periodically. One hundred and eighty-five patients who met the criteria for MCI were enrolled. Blood coagulation functions and plasma fibrinogen levels were measured at baseline. Hyperfibrinogenaemia was defined as plasma fibrinogen > or =3.0 g/l. Global cognitive function was assessed serially with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The enrolled patients were followed for 2 years to observe if dementia was developed. There were 185 patients diagnosed as MCI, of which 17 (9.2%) deceased, 15 (8.1%) lost to follow-up, and 68 (36.8%) developed dementia during follow-up. Mean of MMSE score of the enrolled patients declined significantly during follow-up (22.0 +/- 3.0 vs. 18.1 +/- 5.8, p < 0.001). Patients with hyperfibrinogenaemia at baseline had greater MMSE decrement during follow-up than patients with normal fibrinogen level (-5.4 +/- 5.4 vs. -3.5 +/- 4.5, p < 0.05). Linear regression indicated that plasma fibrinogen level was associated with cognitive decline (R = 0.17, p < 0.05). Patients with hyperfibrinogenaemia had an increased risk for dementia and vascular dementia compared with patients with normal level of plasma fibrinogen (log rank test, p < 0.05). There was a trend that hyperfibrinogenaemia also increased risk for dementia of Alzheimer's type (p = 0.061). It can be concluded that plasma fibrinogen level may be associated with cognitive decline, and hyperfibrinogenaemia may increase risk for dementia in patients with MCI.
