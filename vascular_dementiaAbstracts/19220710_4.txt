BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is known to be a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similarly, MCI associated with small-vessel disease (svMCI), might be a forme froste of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). Patterns of cortical thinning in addition to the ischemia rating on MRI may further elucidate the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of SVaD and svMCI. We tried to determine if svMCI differs from SVaD in the distribution of cortical atrophy, which may help understand the hierarchy between svMCI and SVaD and possibly also how svMCI evolves into SVaD. METHODS: Twenty patients with SVaD, 34 patients with svMCI, 115 patients with AD, and 96 individuals with normal-cognition (NC) were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including 3-dimensional volumetric images for cortical thickness analysis across the entire brain. RESULTS: Compared to NC, svMCI patients showed cortical thinning in inferior frontal and orbitofrontal gyri, anterior cingulate, insula, superior temporal gyrus, and lingual gyrus, while cortical thinning in SVaD patients involved all these areas plus dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortices. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the presence of hierarchy between svMCI and SVaD, and that the cognitive decline from svMCI to SVaD is associated with lesions in dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortices.
