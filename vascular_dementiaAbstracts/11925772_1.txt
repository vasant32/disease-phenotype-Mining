Owing to the progress of individual life expectancy, the number of demented people will clearly increase in the next decades. Cognitive impairment refers not only to dementia, but also to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), associated with reduced complex daily activity and decreased quality of live. It may, in many cases (10-15% per year) progress to permanent dementia. The most frequent aetiologies of dementia syndromes are the Alzheimer's Disease (AD), vascular Dementia (VD), the combination of both and Lewy-Body-Disease. Primarily neuro-psychiatric and internal medical reasons for cognitive decline have also to be taken into account for rational treatment.
