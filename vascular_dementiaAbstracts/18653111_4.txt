Vascular risk factors and data of different examinations relating to extracerebral vascular conditions were analysed in demented patients. Data of demented patients subsequently admitted to the Memory Clinic of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology between March 1995 and February 1996 were registered in a specially designed data sheet. Three vascular examinations (ECG, Doppler examination of main extracerebral arteries on the neck, ophthalmoneurological examination) were carried out. The risk factors and vascular alterations were condensed in two factors. Neither the descriptive data nor the two factors showed statistically significant differences in the main groups (probable Alzheimer's disease--n=24, vascular dementia--n=23, mixed forms--n=15). Based on our results: vascular risk factors and pathological changes can occur in probable form of Alzheimer's disease; they can be present in early onset form as well; the most marked changes are in the vascular dementia group; relevant findings lack any correlation with each other in the point of severity of vascular changes. The extremely high cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity in Hungary seems to be reflected in the results. The role of vascular risk factors and (subclinical) pathological findings seem worth exploring further in Alzheimer's disease.
