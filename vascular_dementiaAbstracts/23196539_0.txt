In the beginning of this century, a dramatic increase of age-related serious neurological disorders including stroke and vascular dementia is expected in concomitant with continuous increase of older-age population. In order to harmonize several strategies to combat these neurological disorders in a reasonable way, it is critically important to promote lifetime education of stroke medicine for neurologist who has main responsibility to treat stroke patients. In the present presentation, to meet the changing medical needs of our population, I attempted to summarize recent progress of stroke neurology concerning acute stroke management, neurorehabilitation and prevention of stroke recurrence and focused on the importance of understanding evidence-based-medicine for stroke management. The crucial role of several guidelines to renew and standerdize essential knowledge of stroke management was addressed to promote stroke team approach including neurologist, neurosurgeon, stroke nurse and rehabilitation staffs.
