The dynamics of oxygen transport in the human brain are crucial to its response to local mismatches between flow and metabolism, such as occur in vascular dementia. We propose here a two phase continuum model, based on the coupled behaviour of oxygen transport in tissue and blood, which we use to simulate micro-strokes. The two phase coupled model is based on the assumption of porous media, being described by Darcy's equation for blood flow and the mass transport equation for oxygen. Simulation results suggest that the flow input is of importance to maintain the oxygen level at the remote region from the arterial-capillary junctions.
