The disorders of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus are all causes of dementia in the elderly population. It is often the case that it is clinically very difficult to tell these diseases apart. All three forms of dementia share the same risk factors, which for the most part are vascular risk factors. This paper proposes that there is an underlying vascular pathophysiology behind these conditions, which is related to the strength of the pulse waves induced in the craniospinal cavity by the arterial vascular tree. It is proposed the manifestation of the dementia in any one patient is dependant on the way that the pulsations interact with the brain and its venous and perivascular drainage. This interaction is predominately dependant on the compliance of the craniospinal cavity and the chronicity of the increased pulse wave stress.
