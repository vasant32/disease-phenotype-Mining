The effects of bis(7)-tacrine, a novel acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on ischemia-induced cell death and apoptosis were investigated in primary cerebral cortical astrocytes of mice. Following a 6 h in vitro ischemic incubation of the cultures, a marked decrease in the percentage of viable cells was observed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Furthermore, using bisbenzimide staining, we determined that approximately 65% of the cells underwent apoptosis. Treatment with bis(7)-tacrine (1-10 nM) during ischemic incubation effectively inhibited the ischemia-induced apoptosis, as demonstrated by morphological and biochemical tests. Our results demonstrated that bis(7)-tacrine could protect astrocytes against ischemia-induced cell injury, indicating that the drug might be beneficial for the treatment of vascular dementia, in addition to Alzheimer's disease.
