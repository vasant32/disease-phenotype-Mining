 OBJECTIVE: To study which cognitive profiles of incipient dementia strongest predict the conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mixed dementia (MD)/vascular dementia (VaD). METHODS: 260 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were included in the study and 209 (79%) were followed up after 2 years. At baseline, the subjects were assessed with a neuropsychological battery covering the cognitive domains speed/attention, memory, visuospatial, language and executive functions. RESULTS: After 2 years, 9 subjects were considered normal, 148 had stationary MCI and 47 (23%) had converted to dementia. Twenty subjects were diagnosed with AD, 15 with MD and 9 with VaD. The others were 2 with unspecified dementias and 1 with primary progressive aphasia. Dementia converters had a high proportion of impairment in all cognitive domains. The profiles of incipient AD and MD/VaD differed, with memory, visuospatial and language symptoms preceding AD, and executive and speed/attention symptoms preceding MD/VaD. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of converting to dementia is increased when domains in addition to memory are impaired. The incipient AD and MD/VaD profiles differed quite clearly. Considering that the vascular group consisted of a majority of patients with MD, the differences are convincing - vascular disease seems to have an essential impact on cognition.
