A 72-year-old hypertensive male was hospitalized with progressive gait disturbance (small step gait), urinary incontinence, and dementia. Computed tomography (CT) showed ventriculomegaly with periventricular lucency. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed wide periventricular high-signal intensity and small infarctions in the basal ganglia. CT cisternography demonstrated ventricular stasis and convexity stasis of the contrast medium. Continuous intracranial pressure monitoring showed increased B wave percentage, low pressure volume index, and high outflow resistance. These findings indicated the coexistence of normal pressure hydrocephalus. After ventriculoperitoneal shunting, gait disturbance was greatly improved and urinary incontinence disappeared. The development of Binswanger's disease may be partially due to disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. The possible pathophysiology of CSF dynamics in relation to Binswanger's disease is discussed. Detailed investigations of CSF dynamics are important in patients with Binswanger's disease, especially in the early stage.
