Some selected CSF and serum components were determined in demental patients classified by the Hachinski test into vascular and primary-degenerative groups. As for the vascular group, the frequency distribution of the serum/CSF albumin ratios characterizing the barrier function corresponds to that of controls, in primary-degenerative cases, however, it is shifted to higher values. In vascular dementia higher CSF LAP activities pointing to actual cell damaging processes in the CNS were found. The concentrations of lactate and some trace metals in CSF and serum are not suitable for differential diagnostic purposes.
