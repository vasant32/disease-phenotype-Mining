 BACKGROUND: Studies of mental disorders using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have been done for many years in China. Many results have been obtained. We review these findings and introduce them to the outside world. METHODS: SPECT papers available on the Chinese Biomedical Bibliographic Database, focusing on depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in China, were reviewed and the results were compared with those obtained outside China. RESULTS: We found that regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was abnormal in mental disorders, but the specificity of the abnormality is not yet consistent. Lower perfusion of rCBF could be seen in frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of patients with depression, AD, schizophrenia, and VD. It seems that abnormality of the frontal lobe is more common in depression and schizophrenia, but temporal lobe abnormalities are more common in AD and VD. The perfusion of rCBF in the parietal lobe seems to be related to aging. Abnormalities in the occipital lobe and basal ganglia seem to be more associated with vascular problems. Thalamic dysfunction was mainly correlated with VD, and that of the cingulate largely with depression and schizophrenia. Hippocampal abnormalities were associated with AD. There were few reports on changes in anxiety disorders and other mental problems. CONCLUSION: There is no specific biological marker of SPECT for individual mental disorders. Further study is needed to provide more specific information on the pathophysiology of mental disorders. It seems that brain abnormalities are similar in Chinese and non Chinese psychiatric patients.
