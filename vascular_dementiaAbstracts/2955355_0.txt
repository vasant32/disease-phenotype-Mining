Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and computerized tomography (CT) have become indispensable to the exploration of patients with vascular dementia. NMR is remarkable for its innocuity, its anatomical accuracy, its sensitivity and the three-dimensional approach it offers. CT is less sensitive, but the examinations are shorter and less costly. These two techniques seem to be about equally effective in visualizing multiple infarcts, although NMR gives a better contrast. In dementia due to multiple infarcts, the bilateral cortical and subcortical lesions coexist with moderate cortical trophy. The cerebral lacunae of lacunar dementia are better visualized by NMR; they are distributed on both sides, predominate in the frontal lobes and only produce slight cortical atrophy, less pronounced than ventricular dilatation. The main advantage of NMR is its high sensitivity in detecting early changes in the white matter, changes which are particularly perceptible in juxta- and periventricular areas in arteriosclerous subcortical leucoencephalopathy. NMR, not very specific here, does not readily separate these lesions from those of other types of leucoencephalopathy. The finding of hypodense areas at CT or of hypersignals at NMR (T2) around the ventricles may help in differentiating between vascular dementia, irrespective of its mechanism, and primary dementia.
