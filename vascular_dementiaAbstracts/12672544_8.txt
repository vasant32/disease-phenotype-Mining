We investigated the incidence and the number of microbleeds (MBs) on T2*-weighted gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging in 30 Binswanger's disease (BD) patients with diffuse white matter lesions and a varying degree of lacunar infarction, 51 multiple lacunar stroke (MLS) patients with multiple lacunar infarction and no or mild white matter lesions, and 59 elderly controls. MBs were found in 23 (77%) patients with BD, 26 (51%) patients with MLS, and 5 (8%) controls, and the incidence and the number of MBs were significantly greater in the BD group compared with MLS and control groups. Patients with BD had a more widespread location of MBs. More specifically, MBs were commonly found in areas within or surrounded by white matter lesions of the patients with BD. When 81 patients from both the BD and MLS groups were analyzed, logistic regression analysis showed that number of lacunar infarct, severity of white matter hyperintensity, and use of antiplatelet agents were significantly associated with MBs. Patients with BD exhibited a high frequency and number of MBs, indicating advanced bleeding-prone microangiopathy within the brain, which should be taken into account in treatment and management.
