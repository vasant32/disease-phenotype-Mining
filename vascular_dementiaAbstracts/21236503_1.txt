Malnutrition is a frequent complication for elderly demented patients even if they live at their own home with the assistance of a caregiver. The present study evaluates nutritional characteristics of a population of 130 non-institutionalized demented patients. The results show that the mini nutritional assessment (MNA) total score is inversely related with the neuro-psychiatric inventory (NPI) score and that the level of cognitive impairment is related with the nutritional status: patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) showed a mean MNA score higher than patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD). Moreover, patients depressed, with hallucinations or with behavioral disturbs are more exposed to underfeeding than only cognitively impaired subjects. In conclusion, an appropriated evaluation of nutritional status could prevent and treat nutrition-related problems even in the elderly demented patients living at home.
