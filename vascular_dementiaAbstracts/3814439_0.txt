The brain was examined neuropathologically in 16 elderly patients with severe dementia (8 cases of senile dementia, 5 of vascular dementia and 3 of combined senile-vascular dementia), focussing an attention on amyloid angiopathy and and other senile changes. The findings were compared with the results obtained in 10 cases of Alzheimer disease described previously. Amyloid angiopathy was noted in all cases of senile dementia and its distribution was similar to that of Alzheimer disease. The frequency of cerebral amyloid angiopathy in elderly patients with severe dementia was more closely related to disease than to age. One patient each with senile dementia and combined senile-vascular dementia showed markedly advanced amyloid angiopathy. The cases who showed other senile changes (e. g., senile plaque, Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangle, nerve cell deciduation) were frequently seen in patients with Alzheimer disease than in those with senile dementia. Further, there was a tendency that the brain weight was lighter in patients with Alzheimer disease than in those with senile dementia.
