Although patients admitted to Internal Medicine Departments are often older than 65 years, the "new geriatric culture" comes into conflict with the traditional goals of Medicine (diagnosis-therapy-recovery). Multidimensional assessment permits global evaluation of the needs and problems of the elderly patient and consequently guarantees an adequate and complete therapeutic plan. This approach is particularly valid if applied in a Medical Division because acute illnesses can compromise a functional state that is already in precarious equilibrium due to frequent multiple pathologies. Moreover, thanks to an accurate evaluation of this type, it is possible to recognize patients with cognitive deficits and diagnose dementia early. In the present study, we utilized a geriatric multidimensional assessment in our Department of Internal Medicine to search for cognitive impairment. Dementia was found in 20% of the geriatric patients: 29% were affected by Alzheimer's disease and 44% had vascular dementia. We evaluated the physical health, functional ability, psychological and socio-economical status together with behavioral syndromes.
