BACKGROUND: An association between anticardiolipin antibodies and dementia has been reported in several recent studies; however, its physiopathological mechanism remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of vascular dementia and anticardiolipin antibodies. MATERIAL/METHODS: A random prospective investigation of 17 male and 13 female patients with vascular dementia was made with regard to anticardiolipin antibodies. Their ages ranged from 56 to 77 years (average: 67.2 years). The criteria of NINDS-AIREN were used to define the vascular dementia. A control group of 25 female and 9 male patients was formed with ages ranging from 62 to 80 years (mean: 68 years). Evaluation of the anticardiolipin antibodies was performed by means of Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA) for the quantitative measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies against cardiolipins in serum. Statistical analysis was done using the Fisher's exact test, where p<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Elevated levels of anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 56.6% of the patients with vascular dementia and 26.4% of the control group (p<0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the prevalence of high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies between the group of patients with vascular dementia and the control group. This proves that anticardiolipin antibodies present a risk factor for vascular dementia.
