Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI), high molecular weight form somatostatin (HMV-SST), somatostatin-25/28 (SST-25/28), somatostatin-14 (SST-14), Des-ala-somatostatin (Des-ala-SST), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured in 21 patients with Binswanger's dementia (BD). Patients were classed into three stages of intellectual deterioration according to the Global deterioration scale (GDS). Levels of SLI were significantly decreased in patients suffering from BD, compared to a control group (19.7 +/- 11.6 fmol/ml vs. 30.5 +/- 8.6 fmol/ml, P < 0.01). There was no correlation with dementia scores (r = 0.34, P = 0.51). The observed qualitative and quantitative changes in the molecular pattern of SLI suggest that occurrence of a dysregulated posttranslational processing in patients with BD. Whereas 5-HIAA levels were not significantly changed in patients with BD, HVA was significantly increased in mild to moderate dementia (GDS 2-4) and significantly decreased in severe cases (GDS 7) (224.3 +/- 69.9 nmol/ml vs. 364.9 +/- 103.8 nmol/ml, P < 0.01); this correlated with dementia scores (r = -0.59, P < 0.01). The existence of significant correlations between SLI, 5-HIAA and HVA in BD point to a heterogeneous and generalized neurochemical process affecting several transmitter systems and functions.
