It is still a challenge to identify typical features of cognitive function in vascular dementia (VaD) in clinical as well as in preclinical stages. Selective empirical findings are described to illuminate degrees of cognitive decline. In predementia stages, speeded performance (motor and mental) and executive functions may be affected as demonstrated by CADASIL subjects and stroke survivors. In dementia stages, motor and mental speed as well as executive functions is commonly affected in addition to typical cognitive dysfunction in dementia (memory, verbal, and visuospatial). To summarize characteristics during preclinical and clinical stages, VaD appears to be associated with impairment in motor and mental speed as well as in executive function.
