BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of the prion protein gene (PRNP) are known to cause a strong susceptibility to the occurrence of prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and might be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders. However, an association between PRNP polymorphisms and vascular dementia (VaD) has not been reported thus far. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the PRNP polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk for developing VaD in the Korean population. METHODS: We compared the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of PRNP polymorphisms in 160 VaD patients with those in 236 healthy Koreans. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Codon 129 (M129V) and 219 (Q219K) polymorphisms in Korean VaD patients were found in the open reading frame of PRNP. Our study shows that there is no significant difference in the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of PRNP codon 129 and 219 polymorphisms between Korean VaD patients and normal controls. This was the first genetic association study of the polymorphisms of PRNP with VaD.
