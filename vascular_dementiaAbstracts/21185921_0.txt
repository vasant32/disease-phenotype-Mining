Danggui-Shaoyao-San (DSS), a traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, is clinically used for the treatment of vascular dementia (VD). This study compared the pharmacokinetics of paeoniflorin, the main active ingredients in Paeonia lactiflora Pall, in VD and normal rats administrated with DSS or pure paeoniflorin. The absorptions of paeoniflorin in both VD and normal group of rats were better when orally administrated with DSS than that with pure paeoniflorin, which justified the combined use as formula DSS. Moreover, a better absorption of paeoniflorin in rats of the VD than in normal group was observed, which is helpful for the treatment of VD.
