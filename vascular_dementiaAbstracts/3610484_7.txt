Vascular dementia is a common and potentially reversible type of dementing illness. Simple, yet valid, assessment instruments are needed to quantitate the severity of cognitive and functional impairment in vascular dementia patients seen in consultation or studied in therapeutic trails. Among sixty-three patients with known ischemic cerebrovascular disease, we found thirteen who satisfied research criteria for vascular dementia, nineteen who were "borderline" and thirty-one who were not demented. We administered the Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination and the Functional Activities Questionnaire to these patients and found both tests capable of distinguishing demented from nondemented groups with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. This battery of assessment instruments was especially helpful in evaluating patients who fell into the "borderline" category. Both tests can be easily administered at the bedside or during routine office visits.
