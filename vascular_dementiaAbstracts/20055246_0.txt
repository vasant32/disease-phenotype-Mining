Patients with cerebrovascular risk factors are nowadays recognized as being at an increased risk of developing cognitive decline of both types. In this pilot study, we evaluated the levels of cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL) in patients with both vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's type of dementia (AD). Cognitive decline was assessed using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a standardized method. The study included 66 patients diagnosed with dementia. AD was diagnosed in 43 patients (22 male and 21 female) mean age (+/- SD) 72.79 +/- 8.19 years and VD in 23 patients (mean age +/- SD, 77.43 +/- 7.58 years). In AD group, 18 patients had cholesterol values within the normal range, whereas 25 patients had elevated levels of cholesterol. The mean value of total plasma cholesterol was 5.39 (SD = 1.05), LDL cholesterol 3.33 (SD = 0.95) and HDL cholesterol 1.41 (SD = 0.34). In VD group, 11 patients had cholesterol values within the normal range, whereas 12 patients had elevated levels of cholesterol. In this group, the mean value of total plasma cholesterol was 5.78 (SD = 1.06), HDL cholesterol 1.44 (SD = 0.57) and LDL cholesterol 3.72 (SD = 0.85). Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels were higher in the group of patients with VD, however, the difference was not statistically significant.
