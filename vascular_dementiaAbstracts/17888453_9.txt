Oxidative DNA damage may contribute to neuronal cell loss and may be involved in pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. We assessed the broad spectrum of oxidative DNA damage biomarkers and antioxidants in mixed Alzheimer disease/vascular dementia (MD) and in control patients. The amount of the products of oxidative DNA damage repair (8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxoguanine) excreted into urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with HPLC pre-purification. The level of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in leukocytes' DNA, antioxidant vitamins and uric acid concentrations in blood plasma were analyzed by the mean of HPLC technique. For the first time we demonstrated oxidative DNA damage on the level of whole organism and in CSF of MD patients. Urinary excretion of oxidative DNA damage repair products were higher in patients with MD than in the control group. The level 8-oxoguanine in cerebrospinal fluid of MD patients almost doubled the level found in the control group. Also the concentrations of ascorbic acid and retinol in plasma were reduced in MD patients. Oxidative stress/DNA damage is an important factor that may be involved in pathogenesis of mixed dementia. It is likely that treatment of these patients with antioxidants may slow down the progression of the disease.
