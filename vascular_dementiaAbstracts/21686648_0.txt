Lymphomatosis cerebri (LC) is a rare variant of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Clinically, the disease typically presents with a rapidly progressive dementia and unsteadiness of gait. Its presentation on cerebral MRI, which is characterised by diffuse leukoencephalopathy without contrast enhancement, often causes diagnostic confusion1 with suspected diagnoses ranging from Binswanger's disease to leukoencephalopathy or encephalomyelitis. Here we report a patient with subacute dementia and diffuse bilateral white matter changes in the cerebral hemispheres and additional involvement of the brainstem, basal ganglia and thalamus on MRI. Initially, she was considered to suffer from an autoimmune encephalitis, transiently responded to immunosuppression but then developed multiple solid appearing cerebral lymphomas.
