The number and nucleolar volume of nerve cells within the nucleus basalis of Meynert were estimated in 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 12 with multi-infarct dementia, 9 with a mixed Alzheimer/multi-infarct dementia and in 10 age-matched controls. As reported previously in Alzheimer's disease, both the number and nucleolar volume of surviving cells was reduced, whereas in multi-infarct dementia no significant change in either measure was noted. In patients with Alzheimer's disease/multi-infarct dementia the loss of nerve cells and reduction in nucleolar volume varied greatly in severity from patient to patient according to the relative balance of Alzheimer and vascular type pathological changes present within each patient.
