A 53-year-old right-handed woman presented with headaches and dizziness. She had been well for ten years following successful cadaveric renal transplantation and was taking prednisolone and azathioprine. Two months later she had more headaches with transient dominant hemisphere disturbances and then suffered a completed right hemisphere deficit. As this was recovering, she developed an ischemic optic neuropathy, Computerized tomography (CT) was then normal although CSF analysis showed lymphocytosis and high protein. Steroid trial led to dramatic symptomatic and clinical recovery. On tailing off steroids, progressive bilateral hemisphere disturbance occurred. She was bedbound, with fever, headache, incontinence and disturbed consciousness. New evidence of infarction in watershed territories on CT led to temporal lobe biopsy. Cortical arterioles and venules showed proliferation of lymphoid cells staining for leucocyte common antigen and B-cell markers characteristic of Neoplastic Angioendotheliomatosis (NAE). After chemotherapy she regained independence and mobility and CSF protein fell. This is the first case of NAE to our knowledge in association with immunosuppression for renal transplant and is further evidence that NAE is malignant lymphoma. Cerebrovascular disease is common in such patients, the simultaneous events in differing territories is typical of NAE. Response to chemotherapeutic agents occurred although the typical natural history was unchanged.
