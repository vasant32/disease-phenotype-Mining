BACKGROUND: Despite rapid development of epidemiology in dementia, reported prevalence in Asia varies among studies and differs from that of Western countries. Few reported the mortality and predictive factors on survival of dementia in Asia, especially China. METHODS: To characterize the epidemiologic pattern of dementia in Shanghai, China, including prevalence and survival, we conducted a cross-sectional, population-based survey among Shanghai residents (> or =55 y) and followed a subsample for up to 40 months for survival analysis. A stratified, multistage cluster sampling design was adopted. RESULTS: Crude and age-standardized prevalence of dementia was 2.99% and 2.66%, respectively, higher in women and increased with age. Prevalence of Alzheimer was higher than vascular dementia. Furthermore, Alzheimer disease was more prevalent in rural areas than in urban, whereas geographic distribution of vascular dementia was quite the opposite. Crude and age-standardized mortality of dementia was 6.06 and 5.30 per 1000 person-years. There was a striking difference in survival between the demented and nondemented, whereas no significant survival discrepancy existed between Alzheimer and vascular dementia. Factors including overall physical and cognitive function, age, and severity of disease strongly influenced survival and might be predictors for fatal events in dementia patients. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiologic pattern of dementia in Shanghai, China is similar to that of western countries.
