A neuropathological study was carried out in 4 cases of ischemic stroke with leuko-araiosis (LA), 3 cases of clinically suspected Binswanger's subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) also showing LA, and 3 cases without LA. Unlike the SAE cases, in 3 of the cases in the first group the white matter changes corresponding to LA could not be explained by ischemic mechanisms related to small vessel changes.
