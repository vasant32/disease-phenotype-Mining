BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] serum levels have been associated with an increased risk of vascular diseases, and preliminary observations suggest that they are a risk factor for vascular dementia. The relationship between Lp(a) levels and cognitive performances in the general population has never been investigated. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of elevated Lp(a) levels on cognitive functions in the elderly. METHODS: Cognitive performances were assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Babcock Short Story, and the Matrix Test in a population sample of 435 white subjects aged 65 to 84 years who were evaluated at baseline and after 3 years. Lp(a) levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in neuropsychological test scores between subjects with and without elevated Lp(a) levels, although subjects with elevated Lp(a) levels had slightly better cognitive performances. This difference reached a statistical significance level only in a subscore of the Matrix Test (number of correct responses) when adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, and history of stroke. At follow-up, no statistically significant difference was found in cognitive performances between subjects with and without elevated Lp(a) serum levels in either univariate or multivariate analyses. Subjects with and without elevated Lp(a) showed a similar decline rate during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of elderly white subjects, elevated Lp(a) levels were not associated with poorer cognitive performances or with an increased rate of cognitive decline. Elevated Lp(a) levels do not appear to be a major determinant of cognitive impairment in the elderly.
