The authors conducted a study of the quantitative content of amino acids in the blood serum of patients with initial and expressed organic neuro-psychic disorders of a vascular genesis and in a group of normals of the same age. In patients with initial organic syndromes the content of cystin-cystein and treonine in the blood serum increased. In patients with expressed organic syndromes the content of cystin-cystein increased, while the content of arginine acid and leicyn-isoleicyn decreased as compared to the control group of elderly people. A comparative study of the two groups of patients with organic psychopathology of a vascular origin demonstrated that in vascular dementia there are more severe changes in the content of amino acids in the blood serum.
