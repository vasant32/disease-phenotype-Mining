We describe the case of a 65-year old man who presented with a first episode of mania lacking a history of previous affective illness. Clinical, neuropsychological and NMR-findings pointed to a subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Morbus Binswanger) as an underlying organic condition. According Kleman's concept of "secondary mania" this case illustrates the necessity a thorough search for organic conditions in late manifesting affective illness which may also involve therapeutic considerations.
