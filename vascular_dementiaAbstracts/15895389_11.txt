Elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are associated with vascular dementias and Alzheimer's disease. The role of Hcy in brain microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) remodeling is unclear. Hcy competes with muscimol, an gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor agonist. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Our hypothesis is that Hcy induces constrictive microvascular remodeling by altering GABA-A/B receptors. MVEC from wild type, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) knockout (-/-), heterozygote cystathionine beta synthase (CBS-/+), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout (eNOS-/-) mouse brains were isolated. The MVEC were incorporated into collagen (3.2 mg/ml) gels and the decrease in collagen gel diameter at 24 h was used as an index of constrictive MVEC remodeling. Gels in the absence or presence of Hcy were incubated with muscimol or baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist. The results suggested that Hcy-mediated MVEC collagen gel constriction was ameliorated by muscimol, baclofen, MMP-9, and eNOS gene ablations. There was no effect of anti-alpha 3 integrin. However, Hcy-mediated brain MVEC collagen constriction was abrogated with anti-beta-1 integrin. The co-incubation of Hcy with L-arginine ameliorated the Hcy-mediated collagen gel constriction. The results of this study indicated amelioration of Hcy-induced MVEC collagen gel constriction by induction of nitric oxide through GABA-A and -B receptors.
