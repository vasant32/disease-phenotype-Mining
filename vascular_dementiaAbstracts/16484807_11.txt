 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Attempting to improve the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the neurofilament heavy chain isoform, NfH(SMI35) was compared to other CSF markers [total tau, phospho-tau, amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta42), the ratio of amyloid beta fragments Abeta42/Abeta40 (Abeta ratio)]. METHODS: CSF levels were determined in patients with AD (n = 109), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 25), frontotemporal dementia (n = 15), vascular dementia (VD, n = 41), and controls (n = 58). RESULTS: CSF NfH(SMI35) was elevated in AD and VD as compared to controls (p < 0.05). Total tau was higher in AD as compared to controls (p < 0.05). CSF phospho-tau was elevated in AD as compared to controls and VD (p < 0.05 each). CSF Abeta42 and Abeta ratios in AD were lower than in MCI and controls (p < 0.05 each). CONCLUSION: The diagnostic potential of NfH(SMI35) is not superior to that of other CSF markers.
