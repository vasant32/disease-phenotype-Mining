We investigated the clinical and cognitive aspects of patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus and possible Binswanger's disease. We studied 19 patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus and 19 patients with Binswanger's disease, comparing them with the same number of matched controls. The patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus had a later age and more frequent gait disturbance at the onset, shorter duration of the illness, rare signs of vascular disturbances, and more frequent severe mental deterioration. Ventricular enlargement may play a role in determining the more rapid and worse clinical course of normal-pressure hydrocephalus.
