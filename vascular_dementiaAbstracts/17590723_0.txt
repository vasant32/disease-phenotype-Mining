Two hundred and twenty-one Saudi patients admitted for stroke in King Khalid University Hospital between 1982 and 1987 were evaluated clinically and by laboratory and radiological investigations. Twelve patients were found to have leukoraiosis on brain CT and a clinical picture compatible with Binswanger disease (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy). Arterial hypertension was present in all cases, seizure disorders in 25%, and dementia in 83%. The features of these cases are compared with similar cases reported from other places. The importance of control of hypertension in prevention of Binswanger disease is emphasized.
