We investigated the premorbid behavioral characters of demented patients in terms of life style, type A behavior, life events and coping behavior. We adopted the case control study. Significant differences were not found in the inventory scores of life style, passive coping behavior and type A behavior between dementia group and normal controls. However, the life events occurred significantly frequent in the vascular dementia group and the score of positive coping behavior was significantly low in dementia group. The results suggest that those life events and positive coping behavior might be related to the onset of dementia.
