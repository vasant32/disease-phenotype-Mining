The purpose of the present study was to examine the clinical utility of the Normative Studies Research Project test battery for detecting dementia with a known vascular component. The study compared 65 patients who had both suffered a stroke and met the DSM-IV criteria for dementia with 86 older medical patients who were cognitively intact. Multivariate analysis of covariance results demonstrated that these two groups had significantly different means on tests within the battery even after controlling for the influence of demographic variables. Logistic regression results demonstrated positive predictive value of 81.36%, negative predictive value of 85. 23%, and an overall correct classification rate of 83.67%.
