BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia are now seen to extend much beyond the traditional multi-infarct dementia.A more homogeneous subtype is the subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD). We applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) criteria based on research criteria for SIVD in a large cohort of patients with ischemic stroke. We compared clinical features of patients with SIVD and patients with other stroke type. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The study group comprised 337 of 486 consecutive patients aged 55 to 85 years who 3 months after ischemic stroke completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and MRI, including structured medical, neurologic, and laboratory evaluations; clinical mental status examination; interview of a knowledgeable informant; detailed history of risk factors; and evaluation of stroke type, localization, and syndrome. RESULTS: Patients with SIVD (n = 86) more often had a history of progressive cognitive decline (22.8% vs. 6.9%, P = 0.0002), walking disorder before stroke (27.9% vs. 2.0%, P = 0.02), and urinary difficulties (12.8% vs. 5.6%, P = 0.028) in comparison with patients with other stroke type (n = 251). Of the study population, 107 (31.8%) had DSM-III dementia. The patients with SIVD more often had DSM-III dementia (40.7% vs. 28.7%, P = 0.04), had less severe stroke as measured by Scandinavian Stroke Scale (56.6 vs. 55.1, P = 0.03), were more dependent in activities of daily living (ADL) functions as measured by FAQ scale (8.9 vs. 5.4, P = 0.001), were more dependent in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) functions as measured by the Lawton scale (5.5 vs. 6.3, P = 0.01), and were more depressed as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (11.8 vs. 8.4, P = 0.0003) poststroke than the patients without SIVD. The main cognitive domain that differentiated the patients with SIVD from those without was executive dysfunction (51.2% vs. 38.7%, P = 0.04). According to multiple regression model, apractic-atactic gait disorder (odds ratio 2.82, 95% confidence interval 1.21-6.53), ADL functions (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.08), and the Beck Depression Inventory (odds ratio 1.05, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.09) related to SIVD. CONCLUSIONS: The most significant clinical features of MRI-defined SIVD were found to be apractic-atactic gait, impaired ADL functions, and depression.
