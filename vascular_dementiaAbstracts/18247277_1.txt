INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are the two most common forms of dementia. In the elderly subjects with dementia, there is a significant comorbidity associated and often cause greater morbidity and mortality. AIM: To investigate some aspects of comorbidity in the patients with these two types of dementia in order to analyze possible differences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 365 patients > 64 years old were prospectively evaluated. Of them 289 patients (79.1%) had probable AD, and 76 patients probable VD. Data were collected on sociodemographic variables, Barthel index, Lawton index), Minimental State Examination, total number of drugs, history of high blood pressure (HBP), diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia (DL), heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cancer. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 264 women (72.3%) and 101 men. Mean age was 81.1 +/- 6 years. Patients were taken an average of 5.5 +/- 2.5 drugs. 54% had HBP, 26.6% DM, 25.8% DL, 12.1% HF, 13.7% COPD and 8.2% cancer. When in multivariate analysis differences were analyzed according the type of dementia, we found a higher percentage of men, taken more than three drugs and lower percentage of taken specific dementia therapy in the VD group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the presence of high comorbidity and chronic drugs prescription in elderly people with dementia. There are some differences according the type of dementia, highlighting a higher percentage of polypharmacy in patients with vascular dementia group.
