A clinicomorphological analysis of 60 postmortem cases with brain circulation disturbances against the background of arterial hypertension (AH) is performed. Lacunar infarcts, areas of incomplete necrosis and perivascular encephalolysis, small hemorrhages, criblures, persistent oedema and widespread spongiosis are found in the white matter (WM) of the brain in cases of AH of long duration with dementia. An important role in the WM lesions belongs to its ischemia due to hypertension angiopathy and disturbances of hemodynamics and liquor circulation. Complex of these lesions is called "hypertension leucoencephalopathy".
