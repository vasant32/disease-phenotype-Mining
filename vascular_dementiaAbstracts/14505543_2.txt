OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and clinico-neuropathological characteristics of Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in Chinese elderly. METHODS: We examined 362 archived brains of aged Chinese from 60 to 95 years of age using an antibody against beta-amyloid peptide and with Gongo red, Bodian and Luxol fast blue stains. RESULTS: CAA appeared in 114 examined brains and the incidence rate in age groups of 60 - 69, 70 - 79, 80 - 89 and beyond 90 years was 22.1%, 26.7%, 46.5% and 66.7% separately; frontal lobe was the most frequently CAA involved part of brain; CAA may also distribute in subcortical white matter and cerebellum dentatus nucleus; close relationships were found between CAA and multiple cerebrovascular lesions, consequent dementia and Alzheimer disease; without other neuropathological changes, CAA alone may result in dementia. CONCLUSIONS: CAA is a common neuropathological finding in brains of Chinese elderly, with an increased prevalence with age. CAA may distribute in subcortical white matter and cerebellum dentatus nucleus, which have been seldom reported before and may contribute to vascular lesions in these areas. CAA may not only participate in the pathogenesis mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, but also result in dementia directly through cerebral hypoperfusion and chronic neuronal ischemia.
