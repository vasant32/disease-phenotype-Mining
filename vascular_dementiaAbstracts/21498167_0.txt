Authors report a case of a 35-year-old male with right-sided mild paresis, incontinence, dysexecutive syndrome, short-term memory loss and behavioral changes. Bilateral cerebral infarcts in the region of the caudate nuclei and the adjacent white matter were proved by brain MRI and multiple stenoses of the branches of Willis-circle were confirmed by MR angiography. Elevated protein level and pleocytosis were found in the cerebrospinal fluid with intrathecal IgG synthesis. Serum rapid plasma reagin, Treponema pallidum Particle Agglutination test, Treponema pallidum ELISA, liquor Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests were positive. Meningovascular neurosyphilis was diagnosed. 24M U/day intravenous penicillin-G treatment was given for 14 days. The patient has vascular dementia due to the bilateral strategic infarcts disconnecting the prefrontal circuits; his symptoms are similar to general paresis. Laboratory and radiologic improvement was observed. Still, the patient have severe residual cognitive decline.
