We studied changes in the concentrations of serotonin (5-HT), kynurenine, and other indoleamines in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer type dementia (ATD) and those with Binswanger type vascular dementia (VDBT), and changes in these indoleamine concentrations 2 weeks after administration of citalopram, a 5-HT uptake inhibitor. The concentrations of total 5-HT (p < 0.005) and kynurenine (p < 0.005) were significantly decreased in ATD patients in comparison to those of the controls. After citalopram administration, there was a remarkable increase in 5-HT concentration (249%, p < 0.0001) and a significant decrease in 5-HIAA concentration (22%, p < 0.02). In the VDBT patients, only 5-HT showed a significant decrease (p < 0.005) in comparison to the control values. It also increased significantly (214%) after citalopram administration. The 5-HT/tryptophan and kynurenine/tryptophan ratios were not correlated for the controls, but did significantly for the ATD and VDBT patients; after citalopram treatment, the increase in 5-HT/tryptophan was correlated significantly with that of kynurenine/tryptophan for ATD, but not for VDBT. These results suggest that both the serotonin and kynurenine pathways are impaired in ATD; whereas, the serotonin pathway alone is in VDBT, and that these impairments are ameliorated by the administration of citalopram.
