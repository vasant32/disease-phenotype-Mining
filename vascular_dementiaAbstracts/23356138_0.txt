We evaluated serum level of S100B in 11 patients with subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) and 19 patients with subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (SVMCI). Comparable groups were age-matched (79.18 +/- 7.76 in SVD group, 77.84 +/- 3.83 in SVMCI; P = 0.53). 22 patients were assessed after 1 month therapy. It was shown that the serum S100B level significantly increased--(0.065 +/- 0.020) micro/l (P = 0.0005) in SVD patients comparing to SVMCI ones - (0.043 +/- 0.010) microg/l. S100B level was significantly correlated with the clinical parameters: MMSE performance (r(s) = -0.61), CDR (r(s) = 0.58), attention task (r(s) = -0.46), pseudobulbar syndrome severity (r(s) = 0.37) and walking alteration (r(s)= 0.37). In patients with reduction of S100B level due to therapy (positive dynamics, n = 12) we registered significant improvement of some clinical parameters: MMSE, attention level, walking. In patients with increasing of S100B level (negative dynamics, n = 10) we didn't registered improvement of any clinical parameters. We made the conclusion that the serum level of S100B could be used as marker of progression SVMCI into SVD and therapy effectiveness.
