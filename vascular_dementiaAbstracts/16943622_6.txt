Brain expression of heme oxygenase (HO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in hypertension may participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension-related neuronal disorders, such as vascular dementia. In the present study, expression levels of HO and NOS in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were investigated using Western immunoblotting assay. Expression level of inducible HO-1 in hippocampus of 4-wk prehypertensive SHR was about twofold of that in age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (p < 0.01). In 23-wk SHR with fully developed hypertension, hippocampal HO-1 level was significantly greater than that of age-matched SD rats (p < 0.05), but not different from 4-wk SHR. There was no difference in expression levels of hippocampal HO-2 between SHR and SD rats at different ages. Total enzymatic activity of hippocampal HO was significantly greater in 23-wk SHR than in age-matched SD rats or 4-wk SD/SHR (p < 0.01). Although hippocampal expression of nNOS protein was relatively unchanged, iNOS expression in 23-wk SHR was about fourfold lower than that in age-matched SD rats and 4-wk SD/SHR (p < 0.01). Total enzymatic activity of hippocampal NOS was significantly lower in 23-wk SHR than in age-matched SD rats or 4-wk SD/SHR (p < 0.01). Significantly suppressed Morris water maze performance was found in 23-wk SHR in comparison with age-matched SD rats. Because SHR has been used as a model of vascular dementia and hippocampus is essential for spatial learning and memory, understanding of altered HO/CO and NOS/NO systems in the hippocampus of adult SHR may shed light on the pathogenic development of memory deficits associated with vascular dementia.
