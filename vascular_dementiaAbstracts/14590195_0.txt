Binocular depth perception is mediated by neural pathways that involve thalamic nuclei, the posterior parietal lobe and adjacent gyri, and white matter projections connecting these regions. Vascular dementia results from a variety of pathologic syndromes that can affect these areas, and in the current study is shown to produce associated impairment of stereoacuity or complete stereoblindness. Stereoacuity was relatively more impaired by right than left hemisphere pathology, by cortical than subcortical vascular processes, and by lesions that involved the parietal lobe. The extent of impairment was related to dementia severity as reflected by measures of intelligence, memory, and visual-spatial function. Stereoacuity was unimpaired in age-matched patients with depressive disorders.
