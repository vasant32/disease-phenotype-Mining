This study investigated the relationship between visuoperceptual ability and visual memory in dementia. Twenty individuals with probable dementia of the Alzheimer type, 24 individuals with probable vascular dementia, and 20 healthy, elderly adults underwent neuropsychological evaluation. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses suggested that perceptual organization skills contributed to a significant amount of the variance in novel, but not famous, face recognition. This finding was most robust in the clinical groups. Causality cannot be attributed from this regression model. Results suggest, however, that visual processing deficits are more strongly related to the memory process at the time of encoding rather than during recognition of remote information.
