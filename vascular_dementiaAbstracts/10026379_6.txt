The dopamine (DA) uptake sites in the caudate nucleus were studied in patients with vascular dementia (VAD) and in a control group using the presynaptic DA uptake site marker [3H][2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane] as radioligand. There was a significant decrease in the number of DA uptake sites in the VAD group, while the binding affinity was unchanged. The present results indicate that in the patients investigated, the cerebrovascular disease process involves dopaminergic neuron terminals in the caudate nucleus. Our findings are discussed in relation to the reductions in number of DA uptake sites that have previously been revealed in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
