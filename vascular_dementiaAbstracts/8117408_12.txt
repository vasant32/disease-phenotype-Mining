We determined the urate and xanthine concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type (VDBT), Alzheimer type dementia (ATD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). We found that the urate concentration was significantly increased in VDBT patients, but significantly decreased in ATD patients compared with controls. The ratio of the concentrations of uric acid (UCSF) to xanthine (XCSF) in the CSF (UCSF/XCSF) had a significant correlation with the ratio of the UCSF to the urate concentration in serum (U(serum)) (UCSF/U(serum)) in ATD and PD, whereas UCSF/U(serum) increased independently of UCSF/XCSF in VDBT. We concluded that the significant increase in the urate concentration in VDBT is mainly due to an impairment of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and its significant reduction in ATD may reflect impaired brain metabolism.
