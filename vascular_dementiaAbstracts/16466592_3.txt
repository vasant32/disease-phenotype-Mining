BACKGROUND: Differential patterns of brain lesions in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD) can result in differing clinical courses and presentations. METHOD: Thirty patients with AD were compared with 29 patients with VaD for differences in behavioral symptoms using the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAV-AD) rating scale. RESULTS: Patients with AD had significantly more delusions, hallucinations, anxieties and phobias and caregiver distress than patients with VaD. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral symptoms in both AD and VaD exhibit specific longitudinal patterns. An understanding of the pattern can aid the treating physician in giving appropriate advice to caregivers regarding the course of the illness and also help them in planning appropriate interventions.
