The gene of an esterase enzyme, called paraoxonase (PON, EC.3.1.8.1.) is a member of a multigene family that comprises three related genes PON1, PON2, and PON3 with structural homology clustering on the chromosome 7.(1,2) The PON1 activity and the polymorphism of the PON1 and PON2 genes have been found to be associated with risk of cardiovascular diseases such as hypercholesterolaemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infaction.(3-8) The importance of cardiovascular risk factors in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD)(9-13) prompted us to examine the genetic effect of PON2 gene codon 311 (Cys-->Ser; PON2*S) polymorphism and the relationship between the PON2*S allele and the other dementia risk factor, the apoE polymorphism in these dementias. The PON2*C and PON2*S allele frequencies were similar in both AD (25% and 75%) and VD groups (23% and 77%), respectively, compared with the controls (27% and 73%). The ratio of the PON2*S carriers was significantly higher among the apoE4 allele carrier AD (27%) and VD (25%) groups than in the control (12%). Our results indicate that the PON2*S and apoE4 alleles have interactive effect on the development of the two most common forms of dementias AD and VD, and further support the hypothesis that cardiovascular factors contribute to the development of AD.
