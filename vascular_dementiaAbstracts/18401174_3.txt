BACKGROUND/AIMS: To describe the natural history of the prodromal stages of ischemic vascular dementia (pVaD). METHODS: A sample of 314 inpatients with pVaD or a clini- cal diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD; lacunar state, Binswanger's disease, pure cortical VaD, corticosubcortical and strategic infarctions) admitted to a teaching tertiary center during a 13-year period was assessed (retrospectively n = 88, prospectively n = 226). Prospective neuropsychological assessment consisted of Mini Mental State Examination, Revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Exit-25, Trail Making tests, Blessed Dementia Scale and Camdex H, Global Depression Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale tests. Univariate analysis and logistic regressions are displayed. RESULTS: An unrecognized pVaD was related with a clinical onset with cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) versus symptomatic cerebrovascular events (p < 0.0001), and with being under therapy with anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents (p < 0.01). Age <85 years at diagnosis of VaD (p < 0.01) correlated with a delayed pVaD diagnosis. CIND onset was associated with a longer prodromal stage (p < 0.01), no clinical strokes during pVaD (p < 0.001), silent ischemia (p < 0.01) and Binswanger's disease (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular cognitive impairment remains an underdiagnosed, yet treatable entity. A brief neuropsychological examination and informant interviews should become standard practice in elderly populations with vascular risk factors. Small-vessel disease is a prevalent condition with a distinct natural history.
