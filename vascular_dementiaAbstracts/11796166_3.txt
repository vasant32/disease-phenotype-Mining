In one study, behavioral disorders of patients with vascular dementia reacted positively to cranial electrostimulation (CES). In the present study, it was examined whether CES could improve cognition and (affective) behavior in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Eighteen AD patients, divided into an experimental and a placebo group, were treated for 30 min per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. No improvements in cognition and (affective) behavior were found after CES.
