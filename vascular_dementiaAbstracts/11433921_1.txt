The subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease) usually starts over 50 years, and it is characterised by slow progression, dementia and stroke-like episodes. The authors analyzed the data of 60 patients, treated in the Neurological Department of Medical University of PÃ©cs between 1994-1997. There was no difference between genders. Among the risk factors only the hypertension and smoking showed correlation with incidence of the disease. The leukoaraiosis found by the CT or MRI was graded according to severity and extension and was correlated with other clinical data (duplex scan, electroencephalographic, and Modified Mini Mental State examination). The morphological damage was related to the age and the decline of cognitive functions, especially with loss of memory, attention and slowing the speech and motor functions regarding to the involvement of the subcortical structures. The role of possible pathogenetic factors and the pathomechanism is discussed.
