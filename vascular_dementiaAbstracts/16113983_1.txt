In contrast to previous International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) meetings, there was a preponderance of sessions dedicated to pharmacological management of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially by cholinesterase inhibitors. Donepezil (Eisai Co Ltd) and rivastigmine (Novartis AG) were most frequently featured, while propentofylline (Hoechst AG) has emerged as an agent potentially efficacious in both AD and vascular dementia. A second focus was the treatment of the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), particularly by the atypical antipsychotics risperidone (Janssen Pharmaceutica NV), olanzapine (Eli Lilly & Co) and quetiapine (AstraZeneca plc), but also by anticonvulsants. Some attempts were made to redress the balance by examining non-pharmacological treatments. There were surprisingly few presentations on the management of depression. Fortunately, most of the presentations focused on the difficult issue of comorbid depression and medical illness. Overall, there were no major disclosures of new drugs. Most new data was simply a refinement of previously published material.
