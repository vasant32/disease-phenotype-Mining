Many of the previous studies of vascular dementia using proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy had been carried out on white matter. However, no proton spectroscopic data of the subcortical gray matter are available in such disease. We report two cases suffering from vascular dementia, with an unilateral N-acetylaspartate (NAA) decrease on subcortical gray matter. This significant reduction in NAA ratios was associated with an increase of choline on the ipsilateral centrum semiovale. We discuss the pathophysiology of these cases.
