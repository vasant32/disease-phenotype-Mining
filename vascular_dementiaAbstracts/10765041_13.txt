The association between the estrogen receptor (ER-alpha) gene and dementia was examined in 223 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 66 with vascular dementia (VD), 17 with alcohol-associated dementia (ALD) and 134 healthy elderly control subjects. The PvuII and XbaI restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the ER-alpha gene were represented as Pp (PvuII) and Xx (XbaI), with capital letters signifying the absence of restriction sites and small letters the presence of restriction sites. We found that the frequency of the ER-alpha gene P allele and X allele in the late-onset AD (LOAD) group (P allele was 0.51, X allele was 0.30) was significantly higher than that in controls (P 0.38, p < 0.01; X 0.20, p < 0.01), and that the frequency of the ER-alpha gene P allele and PP genotype was significantly different between apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers in LOAD. These findings suggest that the genotype of the ER-alpha gene may be specific in LOAD, and that the ER-alpha gene was an additional risk for LOAD.
