BACKGROUND: The Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) is a common measure of cognitive function, but its sensitivity to identify deficits across cognitive domains in vascular dementia (VaD) remains unclear. METHODS: We compared the sensitivity and specificity of two recommended cutoff scores of the DRS. Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with VaD participated in the current study. RESULTS: The original recommendations resulted in poor sensitivity for the DRS total score and attention, construction, and memory subscales. The more recent recommendations greatly improved the sensitivity of the subscales and the total DRS score, but resulted in decreased specificity. Correlations between the specific DRS subscales and criterion measures of cognitive function revealed good convergent and divergent validity for most subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The DRS is a valid measure of cognitive dysfunction in VaD, but clinicians should consider using the more recent recommendations developed for AD to determine impaired performances in VaD.
