OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of the mutation of presenilin-1 in pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The exon 5 of presenilin-1 was analysed by using polymerase chain reaction- single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and ABI 310 genetic analyzer technique in 68 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 65 normal controls. RESULTS: A mobility shift of SSCP in exon 5 of presenilin-1 was detected in 4 patients with Alzheimer's disease;two missense mutations were found. One mutation was at Leu 130 Met and the other at Val157 Leu. Another mobility shift of SSCP in exon 5 of presenilin-1 was detected in 11 patients with Alzheimer's disease. One missense mutation was at Leu 130 Met and one same sense mutation C462-->T. But no mobility shift of SSCP was found in patients with vascular dementia and in normal controls. CONCLUSION: The authors found that mutations in exon 5 of presenilin-1 also existed in patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, which might be one of the points of mutations in sporadic Alzheimer's disease in Chinese.
