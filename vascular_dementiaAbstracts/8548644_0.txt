The neuropsychological follow up of transient ischemic attacks can provide a model for evaluating the efficiency of a drug in vascular dementia. A double blind study has been conducted using nicardipine, a calcium-antagonist, as opposed to a placebo in 40 patients with transient ischemic attacks, over a six month period. The patients were evaluated according to a Wechsler's intelligence scale, and their memory was also tested before and after this period. Although no alterations were registered on either scale, some differences did appear in certain sub-tests, especially as regards the verbal coefficient. This pilot study has provided information concerning the possible beneficial effect of the drug, which should be proven by means of a larger-scale study.
