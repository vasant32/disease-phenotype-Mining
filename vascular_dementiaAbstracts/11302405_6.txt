OBJECTIVE: To report the use of gabapentin in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and to review the available literature relating to the use of gabapentin in this population. CASE SUMMARY: A 62-year-old white man was admitted to the hospital due to a worsening state of confusion, anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, and verbal and physical aggressiveness toward his wife. He had a past medical history significant for vascular dementia. He had been intolerant of or had failed to respond to numerous antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and neuroleptics. The addition of gabapentin to the patient's medication regimen resulted in reduced agitation, sexual inappropriateness, and lability. He was discharged to his home on a dose of gabapentin 300 mg three times daily. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966-August 2000) was performed to identify case reports and clinical trials discussing the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of BPSD. DISCUSSION: Gabapentin, like other anticonvulsants, has been used with success in several psychiatric illnesses. Available literature indicates that the drug may have some efficacy in the treatment of BPSD. It has a favorable adverse effect profile in the elderly, which makes it an attractive altemative to standard therapies, including benzodiazepines and neuroleptics. Optimal dosing remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that gabapentin is a reasonable alternative therapy for patients whose behavioral symptoms do not respond to conventional agents.
