Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in 35 patients with organic dementia (Alzheimer's disease, n = 13, vascular dementia, n = 17, frontotemporal dementia, n = 5) and orthostatic hypotension. Measurements were performed during supine rest and during head-up tilt (60 degrees). Despite marked blood pressure falls, few patients had symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. All three dementia groups had a decrease in regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal lobes during head-up tilt, but no change in mean hemispheric flow. All patients had a consistent drop in their systolic blood pressure upon head-up tilt, with a wide variation over time. The findings suggest that orthostatic hypotension needs to be considered, and actively sought for, in organic dementia as many patients may lack the typical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, despite a marked fall in blood pressure.
