Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), and auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) were studied in 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), eight patients with Binswanger's disease (BD), and 15 normal subjects. Patients with BD showed significant prolongation of the interpeak latency between N13 and N20 (N13-N20) and N20-P40 of SEPs as compared with the normal controls, whereas patients with AD only demonstrated significant prolongation of N20-P40. The interpeak latency between waves I and V of BAEPs in patients with both AD and BD was significantly longer than that of controls. There were no significant differences in P100 latency of VEPs among these three groups. Both groups with dementia showed significant prolongation of N200 and P300 latencies of ERPs compared with normal controls. In addition, patients with AD showed significant prolongation of P200 latency. We conclude that these two dementing diseases have different electrophysiologic features that may be related to their underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Furthermore, the measurement of multimodal evoked potentials may be helpful in the differential diagnosis of AD and BD.
