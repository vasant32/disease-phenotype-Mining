Dementia is an important public health problem of increasing magnitude. At present, available therapies provide only minor and temporary relief, and attempts to find a cure have so far failed. Epidemiological studies have identified risk factors for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. In principle, these findings provide an opportunity to intervene and prevent the dementia epidemic. Attention to nongenetic risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and obesity may thus not only prevent cardiovascular disease but also dementia, although it is difficult to prove the efficacy of these measures for dementia prevention.
