Cognitive decline is common in older adults, even in the absence of significant medical or neurological conditions. Recent work implicates serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in age-related cognitive decline, though no study has directly examined this possibility. A total of 35 older adults without neurological history underwent fasting blood draw and completed a brief neuropsychological test battery during a single session. After adjusting for demographic and medical confounds, higher serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were associated with better performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (r = .36) and short form of the Boston Naming Test (r = .39). These findings extend work from Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia samples and indicate that higher brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are associated with better neuropsychological function in healthy older adults. The exact mechanisms for this relationship are unknown and require further examination.
