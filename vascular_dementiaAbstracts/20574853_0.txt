Current treatment of Alzheimer's disease comprises pharmacological therapy and psychosocial interventions for patients and caregivers in the context of a symptom and severity dependent management concept. Treatment is targeted towards the core symptoms of dementia (cognitive and functional deficits) and if necessary, towards the behavioral symptoms of dementia. The treatment of Alzheimer's dementia with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChE-I; donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and memantine is evidence-based and recommended. For all drugs, the highest tolerable dose should be given. The choice of AChE-I depends on the side-effects and interaction profile, as there is no convincing evidence of a relevant superiority of one of the drugs over another. Mixed dementia should be treated as Alzheimer's dementia. Treatment of vascular dementia with AChE-I or memantine is off-label and without convincing evidence. There is no convincing evidence for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body dementia. Rivastigmine is effective for the treatment of dementia with Parkinson's disease.
