Clinical studies of epilepsy in 137 patients of old age demonstrated that epileptical dementia preserves its nozological specificity. In genuine epilepsy it was not possible to detect symptoms of cerebral atherosclerosis, while in symptomatical epilepsy there were definite signs of arteriosclerotic dementia. Convulsive seizeures in old age become less frequent and are substituted by abortive and psychomotor elementary seizures or are arrested altogether. Epileptic equivalents lose their specifity.
