We have compared the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes of Han Chinese with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (LOAD, n=191), and vascular dementia (VaD, n=124) to controls (n=218) with a similar age distribution. The frequency of ApoE epsilon4 allele in the LOAD group was significantly higher than that in the control group (30.1% versus 10.55%, p<10-7). The risk rate of LOAD was 3.5 times higher for carriers with at least one ApoE epsilon4 allele than for non-epsilon4 bearing controls. ApoE epsilon4 allele was also significantly associated with vascular dementia (OR=1.75, p=0.026). Our findings support previous reports of a positive association between ApoE epsilon4 and both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in Han Chinese.
