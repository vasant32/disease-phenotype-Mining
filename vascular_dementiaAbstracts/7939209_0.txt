Alcohol and drug abuse are the two main addictions in the elderly subject. Prevalence of alcohol dependency is 14% in those over 65 years of age and 17% in elderly psychiatric patients. The distribution of alcoholism between the sexes becomes equal with age. After 65 years of age, the sex-ratio is 1 female to 1.3 male subjects. The elderly alcoholic population consists of both subjects having become alcoholics at a young age and those in whom alcoholic behaviour appeared at a late age. In one third of elderly alcoholics such dependency appeared after 60 years of age. The main risk factors for alcoholism in the elderly subject are lonliness, death of the spouse and the presence of an invalid or bedridden spouse. In the elderly, tolerance to and dependence on alcohol are rare and appear late. Somatic complications are particularly severe (cirrhosis, liver cancer, gastritis, acute pancreatitis and myocardial involvement). Psychiatric complications include anxiety, depression and especially suicide. Alcoholism is the third most frequent cause of organic cerebral dementia, following Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Drug dependency is very often linked to alcoholism and consists of tranquillizers and less often of antalgics.
