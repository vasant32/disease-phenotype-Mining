Vascular dementia (VaD) is a disorder with no cure and limited treatment options. Similarities between VaD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) arise on a number of levels. Both involve progressive decline in cognition, functional ability, and behavior, and there is evidence for a central role of reduced cholinergic neurotransmission in the two illnesses. Treatment strategies in VaD have historically focused on prevention, although evidence of cognitive benefits with preventative treatment is scarce. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors represent a rational treatment possibility for symptomatic therapy of patients with VaD. A recent large-scale trial of galantamine in patients with VaD or AD with cerebrovascular disease (AD + CVD) represents the first placebo-controlled trial showing clinically relevant benefits in these important patient populations.
