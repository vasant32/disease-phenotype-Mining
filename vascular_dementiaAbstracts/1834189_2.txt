Sixteen patients with a clinical diagnosis of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease) were studied. Mild or moderate dementia was found in 14 cases, with characteristic disturbances of concentration, and psychic retardation with apathy. Neuropsychological studies revealed that signs of diffuse lesions in the frontal lobes dominated. Impairment of memory was significant in all cases. Although intellectual impairment in subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy resembled subcortical dementia, some significant differences were found.
