We selected, reanalyzed, and compared data from current prevalence studies of vascular dementia in Europe. Inclusion criteria were: dementia defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, edition 3, or equivalent criteria; case finding through direct individual examination; appropriate sample size; and inclusion of institutionalized persons. Mixed dementia was combined with vascular dementia. Of the 23 surveys of dementia considered, five fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Age-specific prevalence varied more widely for men than for women; differences were greater in older ages. The prevalence increased steeply with advancing age in all countries, and was generally higher in men; it declined over 15 years in the age class of 80 to 89 years in one Swedish population. Within populations, Alzheimer's disease was generally more common than vascular dementia. Unfortunately, prevalence studies of vascular dementia are limited in Europe and worldwide, and their comparison is impeded by the lack of common diagnostic criteria.
