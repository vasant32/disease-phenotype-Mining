OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on the head points for improving gnosia in patients with vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: 90 VD patients were randomly divided into a drug group, an EA group and an EA plus drug group. Scoring with the MMSE scale and detecting the relevant potentials were done before treatment and after a 6-week treatment. RESULTS: Gnosia was improved after treatment in all the three groups with no significant difference by the intergroup comparison. CONCLUSION: The above three therapies can all improve gnosia, reduce the psychological stress, strengthen attention and shorten the awaiting time for recognition; and EA plus Nimodipine seems to be the best in the curative effect.
