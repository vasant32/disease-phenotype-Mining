BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that vascular disease contributes to cognitive impairment and dementia. Clarification of the role of vascular risk factors in dementia is important because most are modifiable, in contrast to other risk factors such as age and genetics. METHODS: In 428 patients with mental illness we have investigated the relation of vascular disease to diagnoses, and a biochemical parameter, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is associated with inflammation and vascular disease. RESULTS: Patients with vascular disease showed higher CRP levels than patients without vascular disease. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer's disease showed lower CRP levels than patients with vascular dementia, mild cognitive impairment or depression. There is no obvious reason for this finding, since it could not be attributed to drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the control of conventional vascular risk factors and therapy could be guided by the level of CRP.
