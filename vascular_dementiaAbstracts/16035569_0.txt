Vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment have attracted more attention recently due to their association with increased risk of death and institutionalization. The purpose of the present study was to detect and identify the characteristics of cognitive impairments during the early stage of lacunar stroke. The subjects consisted of 23 consecutive first-ever acute lacunar infarction patients who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, Kaohsiung Municipal Hsiao-Kang Hospital, Taiwan, from November 2001 to October 2002. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) were used to evaluate stroke severity and cognitive function, and assessments were performed by a neurologist and psychologist, within 10 days of stroke onset. Of the 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had CASI scores below their respective cutoff values and all patients had cognitive impairment in at least one cognitive domain in CASI. There were no significant correlations between CASI abnormality (below the cutoff value) and patient age, education, or the interval from stroke onset. Recent memory impairment was the most often impaired cognitive domain on CASI (19 patients, 82.6%). There were significant correlations between recent memory and "attention or concentration"(correlation coefficient, 0.52; p < 0.05), and "abstraction and judgment" (correlation coefficient, 0.44; p < 0.05). The correlations between recent memory and other domains were not significant. It was concluded that cognitive impairment after acute lacunar infarct is quite common and recent memory is the most often impaired cognitive domain. This may have been caused by the location of the specific lesion as well as by the impairment in "attention or concentration" or "abstraction and judgment".
