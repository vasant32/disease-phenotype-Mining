Reduction in cardiac (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) uptake is a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and is useful in distinguishing them from other neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of this method of scintigraphy in the differential diagnosis of dementia in our Memory Clinic. We performed MIBG scintigraphy in patients with dementia referred to the Memory Clinic and compared the heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio of MIBG uptake. Thirty out of 32 patients with DLB and all 9 PD with dementia patients had reduced H/M ratios, whereas 37 out of 40 patients with Alzheimer's disease had normal H/M ratios. Most patients with vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and other dementias had normal H/M ratios. The overall sensitivity to positively identify patients with Lewy body disease (including DLB and PD with dementia) was 95%, and the specificity to distinguish them from patients with other types of dementias was 87%. MIBG scintigraphy showed a high sensitivity for the detection of Lewy body disease, and also a high specificity for discrimination from other types of dementia. The scintigraphy may provide a valuable and adjunctive method in the diagnosis of Lewy body disease and a differential diagnostic tool for patients with dementias.
