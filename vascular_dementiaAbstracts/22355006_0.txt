 PURPOSE: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, better known as CADASIL, is a rare, genetic form of early-onset vascular dementia. The purpose of this study was to use a modified version of Attention Process Training--II (APT-II; Sohlberg, Johnson, Paule, Raskin, & Mateer, 2001) with an individual with early-stage CADASIL. METHOD: APT-II, modified to include strategy training, was applied in an A-B, multiple-probe design for an individual who had been diagnosed with early-stage CADASIL. Outcome measures included pre-post neuropsychological testing of attention, memory, and executive function; within-treatment probes of visual and auditory attention; and a measure of subjective experience of cognitive functioning in daily living. RESULTS: The participant demonstrated nominal gains on visual and auditory attention probes but improved performance on several posttreatment measures of processing speed and executive function. The participant also reported substantially improved functional outcomes following the intervention protocol. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the potential utility of behavioral intervention for individuals with CADASIL and highlights issues for speech-language pathologists to consider when using structured cognitive training protocols in the setting of progressive cognitive decline. These data suggest that further controlled studies for treating this population are warranted.
