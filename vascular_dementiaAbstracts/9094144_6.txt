Abnormal brain regions generate proportionately less high-frequency (beta) activity than nonpathological regions, a phenomenon accentuated by barbiturate administration. Using quantitative electroencephalography we examined power in the 20- to 28-Hz band in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), vascular dementia (VaD), and normal elderly controls (CON) following an IV bolus of thiopental (0.5 mg/kg). Compared to both CON and VaD subjects, DAT subjects showed a marked loss of beta power elicited across the cortex, with largest differences noted in the frontal region. Losses were most significant for the peak response recorded at 30 to 90 s postinjection and persisted during the 5-minute follow-up period. We hypothesize that differences in this electrocerebral response reflect differences in the underlying neuropathology of DAT and VaD subjects. A thiopental challenge may be well suited for the in vivo assessment of brain function in dementias characterized by prominent cortical pathology.
