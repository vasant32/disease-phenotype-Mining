Vascular dementia appears rarer than previously thought, but the contribution of vascular lesions to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affected patients (mixed dementias) is now recognized as frequent. The role of strategic areas of the brain involved in the cognitive decline induced by vascular lesions and their relative contributions to the severity of the dementing process remain poorly understood. We determined the relationship between the severity of clinical dementia and the volume of different brain areas affected by infarcts in a prospective clinicopathological study in elderly patients. A volumetric study of the functional zones of Mesulam's human brain map affected by vascular lesions was made and correlations between quantified neuropathological data and the severity of dementia were performed in cases with large vascular lesions only, pure AD, and both lesions. The severity of cognitive impairment was significantly correlated with the total volume of infarcts but in a multi-variate model the volume destroyed in the limbic and heteromodal association areas, including the frontal cortex and in the white matter explained 50% of the variability in MMSE and GDS. The total volume of ischemic lesions explained only 0.1-5% of the variability in MMSE and GDS. Age only explained an extra of 0.1-1.6%. This study confirms that infarcts located in strategic areas have a role in the mechanism of cognitive impairment and brings a key for their quantification. It may be useful for developing neuropathological criteria in multi-infarct and mixed dementias.
