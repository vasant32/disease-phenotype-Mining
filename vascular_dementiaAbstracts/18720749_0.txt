INTRODUCTION: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary microangiopathy leading to recurrent strokes and vascular dementia in young and middle-aged patients. The diagnosis of CADASIL is based on typical clinical presentation and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, and has to be confirmed by biopsy of the sural nerve, muscle and skin, as well as by genetic analysis. Mutations within the Notch3 gene were identified as the underlying genetic defect in CADASIL. CASE OUTLINE: The clinical manifestations of the first presented patient with migraine from the age of thirteen, stroke without vascular risk factors and stepwise progression of vascular dementia comprising the typical clinical picture of CADASIL, were confirmed after seven years with pathological verification. The second presented case did not satisfy the clinical criteria for CADASIL. His stroke was considered to be related with vascular risk factors--diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The aetiological diagnosis was established only when his brother without vascular risk factors presented with similar clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: Until the development of the new neuroimaging techniques like MRI, pathologic and genetic analysis, CADASIL was considered as a rare disorder. However, the increasing number of CADASIL families has been identified throughout the world showing that this entity is usually underdiagnosed. This article presents three patients from two Serbian families with clinical suspicion of CADASIL verified by pathologic examination.
