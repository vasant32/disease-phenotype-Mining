The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a 2-stage process, in stage 1, the dementia syndrome, comprising neuropsychologic and neuropsychiatrie components together with deficits in activities of daily living, is differentiated on clinical grounds from a number of other conditions (delirium, concomitant physical illness, drug treatment normal memory loss, etc), in stage 2, the cause is determined, AD being the most common, followed by vascular dementia, Lewy-body dementia, frontal lobe dementia, and a host of so-called secondary causes. Although a mixed Alzheimer/vascular picture is common, gradual onset of multiple cognitive deficits is typical of AD, while abrupt onset, a fluctuating course, hypertension, and focal neurologic signs suggest vascular dementia, in Lewy-body dementia, memory loss may not be an early feature, and fluctuation can be marked by distressing psychotic symptoms and behavioral disturbance, investigations should be minimally invasive and relatively cheap, confined to routine blood tests, chest x-ray and/or electrocardiogram if clinically indicated, cardiologie or neurologic referral in the presence of cerebrovascular signs, and computed tomography if an intracranial lesion is suspected. Accurate diagnosis enables the clinician to outline the disease course to the family and inform them of genetic implications. Numerous instruments for assessing cognitive function, global status, psychiatric well-being, and activities of daily living are briefly reviewed.
