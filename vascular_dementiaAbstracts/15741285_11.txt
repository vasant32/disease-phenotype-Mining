BACKGROUND: The effect of antihypertensive medications on cognitive function has not been well studied. The authors' objectives were to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between the use of antihypertensive medications and cognitive function and to compare different antihypertensive medication classes with regard to this association in an elderly population. METHODS: The medical records of a convenience sample of patients (n = 993 cross-sectional and 350 longitudinal; mean age, 76.8 +/- 0.3 years; 74% women; 87% White) followed at a geriatric practice were reviewed. Data abstracted included demographics, medical history (Alzheimer's disease [AD] or vascular dementia [VaD]), use of antihypertensive medications, and results of cognitive assessments (the Mini-Mental Status Examination [MMSE] and the Clock Draw Test [CDT]). RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, antihypertensive use was not associated with MMSE (p >.05), CDT (p >.05), or dementia diagnosis (odds ratio for AD, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 1.2; odds ratio for VaD, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.6 to 4.0). In the longitudinal analysis, antihypertensive use was associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline on the MMSE (-0.8 +/- 2 points in users vs -5.8 +/- 2.5 points in nonusers; p =.007) and on the CDT (-0.3 +/- 0.8 points in users vs -2.2 +/- 0.8 points in nonusers; p =.002), and with a lower risk for the development of cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.83; p =.004). The trend was similar in patients with baseline AD (p =.02). Patients taking diuretics (p =.007), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (p =.016), and beta-blockers (p =.014) had a lower rate of cognitive decline, and patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (p =.016) had improved cognitive scores. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive use, particularly diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors, beta-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers, may be associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline in older adults, including those with AD. Until a randomized clinical trial confirms our results, findings of this observational study should be interpreted with caution.
