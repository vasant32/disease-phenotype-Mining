Noncognitive or behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are common in vascular dementia. Many occur with the same frequency as in Alzheimer's disease, though depression, emotional lability, and apathy may be more common and psychosis less so. There is a particularly strong relationship between cerebrovascular disease and depression.
