We investigated how sleep disturbance is correlated with brain lesions, cognitive impairment and decreased daily activity (ADL). Two hundred and four chronically ill patients including patients with vascular dementia were classified into eight groups based on cognitive function, ADL and grades of PVL (periventricular lucency) as shown by computerized tomography. Visual monitoring of the sleep/wake state was performed hourly for 14 consecutive days and the daytime sleep hours and the nighttime sleep hours were determined based on detected disturbances in the sleep/wake pattern. Whether any specific infarcted regions were correlated with sleep disturbance was also evaluated. We found that daytime sleep hours were increased and nighttime sleep hours were decreased by three single factors: cognitive impairment, decreased ADL and the severe grade of PVL. As for an interactive effect of the two factors, daytime sleep hours were increased by dementia with decreased ADL (independent of PVL) and increased by decreased ADL with the severe grade of PVL (independent of dementia). Although three factors affected sleep independently, ADL has an interactive effect on sleep with dementia and with PVL. No specific cortical regions related to sleep disturbance were found.
