We measured hydroxyl radical (.OH) levels in blood, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in red blood cells (RBC) relative to both total protein (RBC-SOD/P) and Cu,Zn-SOD protein (RBC-SOD/SOD), SOD activity in plasma (plasma-SOD), and Cu,Zn-SOD protein relative to total RBC protein (Cu,Zn-SOD/P) in 22 patients with probable dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT group, mean age 74.8+/-9.4 years), 16 with probable vascular dementia (VAD group, mean age 76.9+/-6.7 years) and 19 non-demented controls (control group, mean age 73.5+/-6.2 years). Levels of .OH in the DAT and VAD groups were significantly (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively) higher, whereas the values of RBC-SOD/P and RBC-SOD/SOD in these two groups (both P<0.001) and Cu,Zn-SOD/P in the DAT group (P<0.001) were significantly lower than the corresponding control values. Members of the VAD group with risk factors for stroke (RF+ group) showed significantly higher .OH levels than members of the VAD group without risk factors (RF- group; P<0.01) and the control group (P<0.001). RBC-SOD/P and RBC-SOD/SOD values in the RF+ group were significantly (both P<0.01) lower than the corresponding control values. There were no significant differences among the VAD, RF+ and control groups with respect to Cu,Zn-SOD/P values, or between the RF- and control groups for any measured parameter. We conclude that oxidative stress plays a role in the brain damage seen in both DAT and VAD, and that the causes of decreased SOD activity in RBC differ between DAT and VAD patients.
