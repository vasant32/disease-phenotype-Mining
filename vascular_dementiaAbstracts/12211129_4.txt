OBJECTIVES: the aim of the present study was to elucidate a possible relationship between depressive symptomatology and regional brain symptomatology in demented patients. METHODS: 170 consecutive inpatients were studied. They suffered from Alzheimer's disease (103 patients), vascular dementia (48 patients), or frontotemporal dementia (19 patients). The patients underwent a neuropsychiatric investigation, which included assessments of (1) depression, and (2) regional brain symptomatology. Depressive symptomatology was assessed as presence of (a) depressed mood, and (b) anxiety. In the further statistical analysis, the presence of depressed mood and/or anxiety was also evaluated. The principle of the regional symptom analysis was the successive aggregation of observable symptom variables, leading to the final determination of four possible regional brain syndromes (frontal, subcortical, parietal and global), by way of the Stepwise comparative status analysis (STEP). The possible correlations between regional brain symptomatology and depressive symptomatology were analysed by means of (a) chi(2) statistics, and (b) a logistic regression analysis in which confounding factors were included (age, degree of dementia, duration). RESULTS: the subcortical syndrome correlated with depressed mood (chi(2), p = 0.002; logistic regression, p = 0.002). A negative correlation was noted between the parietal syndrome and depressed mood (p = 0.010 and p = 0.013, respectively). No other significant correlations between presence of regional brain syndrome and presence of depressive symptomatology could be seen. CONCLUSIONS: demented patients with a clinically established subcortical dysfunction appear to be more susceptible to depressive symptomatology. The results of this study also suggest that posterior brain dysfunction in dementia is not correlated with depressive symptomatology.
