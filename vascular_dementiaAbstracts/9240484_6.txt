Longitudinal changes in global cognitive functioning, indexed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in subjects with dementia (Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) were examined. The roles of several demographic, psychometric, and biological indices in predicting cognitive deterioration were also examined. The sample consisted of 36 very old (M age at entry = 83.0 years, range = 75-95) adults with dementia from a community-based study. Subjects were tested on two occasions separated by approximately 2.5 years. Results indicated significant longitudinal decline in MMSE scores over the retest interval; the average decline was estimated as 2.43 (SD = 1.81) points per year. Several factors were associated with cognitive deterioration. Higher initial MMSE scores were associated with greater deterioration, whereas superior forward digit span and Block Design at entry were associated with attenuated decline, once differences in baseline severity were accounted for. By contrast, a variety of other putatively important variables exhibited no relationship to decline, including age, gender, education, onset age, dementia type, backward digit span, as well as a number of biological parameters (e.g., vitamin B12, folic acid). The results suggest that although the magnitude of cognitive deterioration in dementia is highly variable, several indicators may be useful predictors of future changes in cognitive functioning.
