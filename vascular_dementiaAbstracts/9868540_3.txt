Propentofylline (PPF, 3-methyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-7-propylxanthine) has been reported to be effective for the treatment of both vascular dementia and dementia of the Alzheimer type. The pharmacological effects of PPF may be exerted via the stimulation of nerve growth factor, increased cerebral blood flow, and inhibition of adenosine uptake. The objectives of this experiment are to determine the kinetic behavior of PPF, to identify, and to quantify its metabolite in human. Blood samples were obtained from human volunteers following oral administration of 200 mg of PPF tablets. For the identification and quantification of the metabolite, 3-methyl-1-(5-hydroxyhexyl)-7-propylxanthine (PPFOH), PPFOH was synthesized and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The molecular weight of synthesized metabolite is 308 dalton. The PPF and PPFOH in plasma were extracted with diethyl ether and identified by electron impact GC/MS. The plasma concentrations of PPF and PPFOH were determined by gas chromatography/nitrogen phosphorus detector in plasma and their pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. The mean half-life of PPF was 0.74 hr. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of PPF and PPFOH were 508 and 460 ng.hr/ml, respectively. Cmax of PPF was about 828.4 ng/ml and the peak concentration was achieved at about 2.2 hr (Tmax). These results indicate that PPF is rapidly disappeared from blood due to extensive metabolism into PPFOH.
