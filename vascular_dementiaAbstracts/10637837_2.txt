INTRODUCTION: The dementias and Alzheimer's disease are a growing problem in countries with a long life expectancy. OBJECTIVE: To find the prevalence of the dementia syndrome in the population aged over 60 years in the municipality of Marianao, La Habana, during the first three months of 1998, and the relationship with certain associated biosocial factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive transversal study in which 799 elderly persons were assessed in their homes, out of a population of 22,590 elderly persons, by means of conglomerate sampling in two stages. In the same way, we selected a sample from the municipality of Bauta representing 340 adults. The probable diagnosis of dementia syndrome or Alzheimer's disease was based on criteria of DSM III R and NINCDS-ADRDA. A second analytical phase was done by studying cases and witnesses. Univariate and multivariate hypothesis tests were done by means of the multiple logistic regression method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the dementia syndrome was 8.2% (6.27-10.42); and that of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia was 5.13% and 1.93% respectively. Age, female sex, previous clinical history and no spouse (due to widowhood or being single), were risk factors in this population. Early detection of the dementia syndrome allows development of projects to intervene in old people to actively improve their state of health and socio-familial adaptation.
