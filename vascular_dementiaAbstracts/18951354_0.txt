A 65-year-old architect was admitted to our Memory Clinic because of rapidly progressive dementia accompanied by behavioral disorders, which severely restricted his functional independence. The physical examination revealed several focal neurological signs, and neuroimaging confirmed a cerebellar hemorrhage, multiple microbleeds and an ischemic lacunar infarct. Executive functioning was highly impaired. This case report illustrates cerebral amyloid angiopathy as an important entity of vascular dementia and highlights the importance of neuroimaging in patients with suspected vascular cognitive disorders.
