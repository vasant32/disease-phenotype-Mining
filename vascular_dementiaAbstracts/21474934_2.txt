 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Genetic risk factors have not been clearly established for vascular dementias (VaD) related to stroke and cerebrovascular disease. METHODS: Samples were genotyped for APOE, MTHFR and ICAM. Aβ levels and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities were assayed in controls and individuals with VaD. RESULTS: Associations were found between the APOE-ε4 allele and mixed dementia, infarct/stroke dementia and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), and higher Aβ1-42 levels and decreased ChAT activity. MTHFR was more associated with SIVD, mixed dementia, and lower ChAT activity. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates important differences in the genetic associations of VaD and begins to clarify the genetic basis of key pathological substrates.
