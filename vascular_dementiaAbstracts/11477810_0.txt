OBJECTIVE: To observe clinical effects of Zhiling Decoction (ZLD) in treating senile vascular dementia. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were randomly divided into treated group and control group. In treated group which was treated with ZLD, a self-formulated proved recipe. In control group, which was administered with Naofukang ([symbol: see text]). RESULTS: ZLD could decrease the level of serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride and plasma LPO significantly; increase the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and SOD in red blood cells; dilate cerebral vessels, increase cerebral blood flow. As for P300, an index to reflect intelligence, the latency of P3 was shorter and the amplitude was raised, the brain electrical activity monitoring (BEAM) was improved remarkably, the revised Nagayakawa dementia scale scoring (NDS) of patients promoted, clinical symptom was improved significantly. Total effective rate in clinical practice reached 87%. CONCLUSION: ZLD had good effects on senile vascular dementia indeed.
