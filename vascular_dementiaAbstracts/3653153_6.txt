The activity of acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase was determined in serum and CSF of controls and patients suffering from different types of dementia. A statistically significant decrease in the activities of both esterases was observed in CSF of demented patients, however, primary degenerative and vascular dementia did not differ in their CSF cholinesterase levels. Compared to age-matched controls the serum butyrylcholinesterase activity was also significantly lowered in the overall dementia group. No typical serum and CSF cholinesterase isoenzyme pattern was found for dementia or any of its subgroups. It is concluded that the cholinesterase levels reflect metabolic alterations associated with dementia as a collective group but cannot be used for differential diagnosis of subgroups.
