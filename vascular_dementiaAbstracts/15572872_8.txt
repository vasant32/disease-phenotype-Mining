OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of the anatomic distribution of amyloid deposition to focal and global cognitive dysfunction in different subtypes of dementia. METHODS: We quantified AB40 and AB42 in the temporal lobe and entorhinal cortex and examined their relationship to cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). RESULTS: We found a correlation between memory impairment, but not global cognitive impairment, and amyloid load in these areas in AD and VaD but not in DLB. This relationship was stronger for AB42 and in the entorhinal cortex. CONCLUSION: The anatomic location of amyloid deposition is an important factor-specific factor in memory impairment in AD and VaD.
