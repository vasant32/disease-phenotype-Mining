 OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of nimodipine on hippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and proinflammatory cytokines in rats with experimental vascular dementia. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15/group): sham operated controls (group A); focal cerebral ischaemia (group B); vascular dementia (group C); and vascular dementia treated with 20 mg/kg nimodipine daily (group D). The Morris water maze test evaluated learning and memory, and magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted imaging was used to measure rCBF. Hippocampal levels of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were measured. RESULTS: Compared with group C, rats in group D demonstrated significantly improved learning ability and significantly increased hippocampal rCBF. The levels of NF-κB, TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly lower in group D than in group C. Hippocampal nerve cell morphology was abnormal in group C but near normal in group D. CONCLUSIONS: Nimodipine improved the symptoms of cognitive impairment, increased rCBF, reduced hippocampal cytokine levels and alleviated neuronal injury in the hippocampus of rats with experimental vascular dementia.
