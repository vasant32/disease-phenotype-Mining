In Gerontopsychiatry, standardised psychological methods are applied to investigate early stages of dementia, to quantify cerebral dysfunctions and to evaluate the degree and severity of dementia. Only some psychological tests and rating scales are apt to differential diagnosis: A clinical comparison of demented and depressive patients proved significantly different in three out of twelve psychological tests applied. The performance of memory, perception and reproduction of geometric forms (Benton Visual Retention Test) and the choice-reaction time was reduced in demented patients. Patients with different dementia types could not be differentiated by means of psychological tests. To verify the diagnosis of vascular dementia, a clinical-psychiatric Scale ("Ischemic Scale") proved to be of good clinical value.
