Patients who have had stroke are at significant risk for various neuropsychiatric illnesses. The most common and important of these are poststroke depression and poststroke dementia (attributable to vascular dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, or a combination of mechanisms). Poststroke neuropathology may lead some patients to experience concurrent and "overlapping" mood and cognitive symptoms. Less frequently, poststroke anxiety disorders, psychosis, isolated pathologic expressions of emotions, and apathy or fatigue may be encountered. The authors review the current literature on poststroke neuropsychiatry and offer an integrated approach to pathophysiologic concepts and clinical surveillance, screening, diagnosis, and evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic intervention for these clinical problems on the clinical boundary between neurology and psychiatry.
