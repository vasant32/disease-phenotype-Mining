INTRODUCTION: Lesions in the periventricular white matter are a quite common neuroradiological finding in older patients. They are called leukoaraiosis and can be associated to several syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between leukoaraiosis and the different vascular risk factors that can be involved in its development. METHOD: Fifty consecutive patients with leukoaraiosis in CT scan were included as well as fifty age and sex-matched controls; all of them belonged to the same population. Previously vascular risk factors were defined according to strict criteria. RESULTS: The commonest vascular risk factor was arterial hypertension, in second place previous cerebrovascular accidents and in third place heart diseases. There was a very significant difference for hypertension in the univariant analysis, which was subsequently confirmed in the multivariant analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The vascular risk factor most strongly associated to leukoaraiosis was arterial hypertension followed by cerebrovascular disease and heart diseases. The remaining of the analysed factors had a insignificant prediction power.
