Cerebral hemodynamic impairment has come under examination over the years as an independent cause for cognitive dysfunction, but only recently has the advance of imaging and ultrasound technology permitted a fuller investigation of physiopathology. Beyond the impact of fixed structural lesions such as infarction and white matter hyperintensities, hemodynamic dysfunction, which includes hypoperfusion and altered cerebral autoregulation, may be independently associated with cognitive decline. More importantly, whereas vascular-related structural pathology may produce so-called vascular dementia, disorders of blood flow and blood flow regulation may also present clinically as mild cognitive impairment or even frank dementia, but may in fact be reversible. Hemodynamic effects may occur at the level of the cerebral hemisphere due to restricted flow through a large vessel of the neck or head, at a global level in the setting of cardiac failure, or intrinsically due to dysfunction of the endothelium in the microvasculature. This review surveys clinical, imaging, and physiological evidence for the association between hemodynamic abnormalities at these different levels and cognitive impairment.
