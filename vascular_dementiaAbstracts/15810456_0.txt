OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Naomaitai capsule on the learning and memory abilities and the content of acetylcholine(Ach) in the brain tissue of the model rat. METHOD: One vascular dementia(VD) model was produced by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries in rats with following steps: ischemia 20 minutes-reperfusion 10 minutes-ischemia 20 minutes. The learning and memory abilities were tested by water maze. The other VD model was formed by 4-vessel occlusion-reperfusion injury in rats. The time of right reflect recovery and the content of Ach in the brain tissue were determined. RESULT: Naomaitai capsule can significantly improve the learning and memory abilities of the dementia rats( P < 0.05, P < 0.01), increase the content of Ach (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) and reduce the time of right reflect recovery(P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Naomaitai capsule can improve the learning and memory abilities by increasing the content of Ach of the VD rats.
