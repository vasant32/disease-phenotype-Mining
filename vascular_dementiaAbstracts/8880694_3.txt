In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in thirty patients with mild to moderate vascular dementia (VD) according to DSM-III-R criteria, the effects of the adenosine uptake blocker propentofylline (HWA 285) on regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGl) was studied using positron emission tomography of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). 25 subjects completed the 3-months study. Propentofylline significantly improved relative rCMRGl in the motor cortex, while relative rCMRGl in the placebo treated group worsened significantly. Neuropsychologically, visual information processing was improved in the propentofylline group and we observed a trend towards a slowing of the progression of cognitive deterioration in patients with VD. The results of the longitudinal analysis showed further that neuropsychological and metabolic changes are closely related. These findings justify a large-scale clinical trial to prove therapeutic efficacy.
