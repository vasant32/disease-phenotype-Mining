Vascular dementia (VD) may arise as a sequel to any form of cerebrovascular disease. Since only some patients with cerebrovascular disease will eventually develop dementia, we studied the morphological and clinical findings associated with dementia in cerebrovascular patients. The relationship between these factors and the dementia syndrome was evaluated in 25 patients with VD, and 68 non demented subjects with a history of cerebral ischemic attacks. We found that VD was significantly associated with white matter lesions and atrophy on CT-scan, and a high prevalence of frontal lobe symptoms and signs.
