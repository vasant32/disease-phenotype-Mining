The diagnostic utility of the Fuld cholinergic deficit profile (Fuld, 1984) to dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) was evaluated on the Japanese version of the WAIS-R. Profiles were calculated for groups of subjects with DAT(n = 236), vascular dementia (n = 29), frontotemporal dementia (n = 22), and hydrocephalic dementia (n = 10). The frequency of positive profile occurrence for the subject groups was as follows: 23/236 for DAT (9.7%), 2/29 (6.9%) for vascular dementia, 2/22 (9.1%) for frontotemporal dementia, and 2/10 (20%) for hydrocephalic dementia. No significant difference in the frequency of positive profile occurrence was revealed across four types of dementia. We conclude from these findings that the Fuld profile lacks the diagnostic utility on the Japanese WAIS-R.
