We performed diffusion MRI studies in 14 patients with extensive ischemic leukoencephalopathy, including 9 with dementia (diagnosed as Binswanger's disease), and 5 without dementia, and 8 age-matched controls. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in anterior and posterior periventricular white matter were significantly higher in demented and non-demented patients than in the controls, and diffusion anisotropy disappeared in patients because of the high ratio of the diffusion coefficients perpendicular to the nerve fibers to those parallel to the nerve fibers. ADCs in the corpus callosum were significantly higher in demented patients that in non-demented patients and controls. Therefore, diffusion anisotropy disappeared only in demented (Binswanger's disease) patients. These results suggest that the cerebral white matter lesions in Binswanger's disease reflect a decrease of nerve fibers and diffuse myelin loss, and that the loss of nerve fibers in the corpus callosum may play a role in inducing cognitive decline. Diffusion MRI may be useful in the pathophysiological evaluation of cerebral white matter lesions.
