Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common heritable cause of stroke and vascular dementia in adults. We present a family from Serbia presenting with stroke and depression in the lack of vascular risk factors, with brain MRI indicating CADASIL. A novel NOTCH3 Gly89Cys mutation was located in exon 3. This report illustrates that in the setting of a positive family history with typical clinical and MRI features, even with an atypical form of pedigree, a high suspicion of CADASIL should lead to genetic testing.
