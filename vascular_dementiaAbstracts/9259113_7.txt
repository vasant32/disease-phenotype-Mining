In order to evaluate the biological effects on some haemostasis factors of antithrombotic-hemorheological treatments on patients with vascular dementia, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, study comparing sulodexide (Sdx, 50 mg bid orally for 6 months) and pentoxifylline (Ptx, 400 mg tid orally for six months) was carried out. Eighty-six patients, 46 in Sdx group, 40 in Ptx group, fulfilling the NINDS-AIREN criteria for probable vascular dementia were evaluated. Plasma fibrinogen levels showed a significant reduction in both groups, in patients with high basal levels (> or = 350 mg/dl), the reduction being earlier in Sdx group (2nd month of therapy) than in Ptx group (4th month of therapy). In Sdx group a significant reduction in factor VII-Ag (baseline 102.8 U/dl; 6th month 90.1 U/dl) was also observed. Both drugs induced a slight reduction in activated factor VII levels as well. A parallel improvement of G.B.S. Rating Scale for dementia scores was observed in Sdx group. These results seem to indicate that sulodexide treatment can have positive effects in vascular dementia.
