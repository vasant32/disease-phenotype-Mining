Gait disorders are more common in dementia than in the context of the physiological aging process. Prevalence of dementia-associated gait disturbances depends on the type of dementia and the severity of cognitive impairment. While in vascular dementia gait abnormalities are often clinically apparent at early disease stages, Alzheimer's disease patients usually have stable gait until late disease stages. With up-to-date ''brain-imaging" methods, it has been demonstrated that people suffering from dementia are more dependent on cortical activity in order to maintain gait stability in complex situations. When dysfunction of the frontal or temporal lobes occurs, allocation of these resources may no longer be sufficient. Dual-task paradigms are useful to test such resources. It has been shown in early Alzheimer's disease patients that, if the demand of attention exceeds available capacities, quantitative gait changes occur. Relevant parameters seem to be, e.g., walking speed and stride-time variability. Quantitative assessment of gait dysfunction in dementia may, thus, have the potential to serve as a trait marker.
