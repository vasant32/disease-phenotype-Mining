BACKGROUND: In the present study patients suffering from dementia were treated with an infusion therapy using the neurotrophic drug Cerebrolysin. The effectiveness of the therapy was examined under conditions of daily clinical practice. METHODS: 645 Patients were treated with 30 ml Cerebrolysin daily. The average period of treatment was 17.8 days. Prior to treatment patients were diagnosed according to DSM-III-R. In addition a differential diagnostic examination using the Hachinski Ischemic Score was performed. Clinical symptoms and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were determined before and after therapy. RESULTS: Cerebrolysin therapy led to a significant (p < 0.001) improvement in memory for 62% of the patients. 65% showed improvement in concentration, 50% in mood and fatigue, and 47% improved in vertigo. An improvement in the Clinical Global impression was observed in approximately 80% of the patients. The improvement of symptoms was significantly larger (p < 0.05) in younger, less afflicted patients than in the older, more seriously ill patients. The unusual good tolerance of Cerebrolysin was especially noteworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the results of earlier clinical studies with Cerebrolysin in the treatment of Alzheimer patients and patients with vascular dementia in which similar responder rates were observed. The significant dependence of therapeutic success on the length and severity of illness confirms that timely pharmacological intervention leads to best therapeutic results.
