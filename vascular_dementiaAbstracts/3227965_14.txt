In 35 patients with Alzheimer's presenile disease (AD), 56 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), 54 patients with vascular dementia (VD) and 10 patients with confusional states, age, vitamin B12 in serum, P-folate, B-folate and B-Hb were investigated. Platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyin-doleacetic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were measured. Group differences showed that vitamin B12 levels were reduced in the group of patients with confusional states and SDAT. Five out of ten and 13 out of 56 (respectively) had vitamin B12 concentrations below the lower limit of the reference value (130 pmol/l). A negative correlation was found between B12 levels and platelet MAO activity. The findings indicate that there is a subgroup of patients with late-onset dementia that has low vitamin B12 blood concentrations. HVA levels in CSF, usually found to be reduced in AD patients, were normal in this subgroup.
