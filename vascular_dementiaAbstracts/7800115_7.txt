41 patients (30 men, 11 women, mean age 65.3 +/- 9.7 years) with probable ischemic vascular dementia diagnosed according to stated clinical criteria at least 3 months after hospital discharge and among a few nonhospitalized subjects with thorough clinical, neurovascular and neuroimaging workup have been followed for the past 7 years with serial measures of neurological and cognitive status and cerebral blood flow using stable xenon-enhanced CT. Cognitive impairments correlated with cerebral ischemia rather than CT measurements of infarcted brain volume. A minimum of one follow-up was required and follow-up intervals ranged from 4 months to 6.6 years (mean 3.4 +/- 1.6 years). 9 patients (22.0%) were lost to follow-up, 4.9% died, 9.8% became incapacitated by additional strokes, 2.4% by cancer and 4.9% moved away. Cross-sequential designs adjust for problems of attrition. Mortality rates of 1.4%/year during 1986-1993 are significantly lower than 2.0%/year between 1983 and 1986. Declines in mortality are attributed to control of risk factors and antiplatelet treatment of atherosclerotic cerebral vascular disease and anticoagulant treatment of patients with cardiogenic embolism.
