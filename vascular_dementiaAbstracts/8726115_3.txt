Relationships between urinary levels of alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha 1M) and ulinastatin (UT) in patients with dementia were investigated. There were no significant differences in alpha 1M and UT levels and alpha 1M: UT ratios among three groups: age-matched control subjects, patients with either Alzheimer-type senile dementia (ATD) or vascular dementia (VD). Although a positive correlation was established between alpha 1M and UT levels in these groups, the regression of the demented patients differed significantly from that of controls (P < 0.05). A tendency towards a negative correlation between alpha 1M: UT ratios and the levels of severity or duration of the disease was displayed in the ATD group, whereas a tendency toward a positive correlation between alpha 1M: UT ratios and the levels of severity was observed in the VD group. These results suggest that changes in the relationships between urinary levels of alpha 1M and UT may provide a useful biochemical index for diagnoses of ATD and VD.
