All vascular dementia (VaD) cases, neuropathologically verified in a longitudinal prospective dementia project, were classified according to the vascular brain lesion type and related to the dementia type and cardiovascular pathology. From 1976 to 1995, there were 175 VaD cases, 49 of which were pure, without Alzheimer pathology and only one type of cerebrovascular lesion. Furthermore, it was found that 6 cases suffered hypoxic hypoperfusive disease, while 7 were found to have large vessel disease and 36 small vessel disease. In addition to Alzheimer pathology, more than one type of vascular brain pathology was found in the remaining 126 cases. In these cases, diagnosed in accordance with the predominant type of VaD, hypoxic-hypoperfusive lesions were found in 55, large vessel lesions in 50 and small vessel lesions in 110 cases. It should be stressed that 87% of all cases with hypoxic hypoperfusive lesions also had Alzheimer pathology. Cardiovascular and aortic pathologies were more prevalent in small vessel dementia than in the other VaD groups. Clinically diagnosed arterial hypertension was significantly associated with small vessel dementia, but not with hypoxic-hypoperfusive dementia. Cardiovascular symptoms varied considerably in frequency between different dementia groups. VaD is a heterogeneous group regarding lesions caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms and with different combinations of brain pathologies. It is therefore necessary to identify the various types of vascular brain lesions for a correlation with clinical symptoms and for diagnostic purposes in the search for risk factors and therapeutic strategies.
