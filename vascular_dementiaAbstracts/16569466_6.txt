We measured the thickness of the substantia innominata using magnetic resonance imaging in 122 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 31 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 34 patients with vascular dementia (VaD), and examined the correlates of cognitive response to donepezil. Although all dementia groups showed significant atrophy of the substantia innominata compared to 28 age-matched controls, atrophy was greater in the DLB group, but less in the VaD group than the AD group. Mini-Mental State Examination score changes at 12 weeks after donepezil administration inversely and significantly correlated with the thickness of the substantia innominata in patients with AD (n=103, r=-0.43, p<0.0001) and in patients with DLB (n=24, r=-0.57, p<0.01), but not in patients with VaD (n=12, r=-0.22, p>0.1). There may be some differences in cholinergic impairment among AD, DLB and VaD, reflecting cholinergic neuropathology. Clinical response to cholinergic therapy may be partly attributable to damaged cholinergic neurons in AD and DLB, but not in VaD, suggesting differences in the therapeutic implication of cholinergic system degeneration.
