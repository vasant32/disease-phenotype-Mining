The neuropathological staging model proposed by Braak and Braak (1991) implies that the evolution of neurofibrillary pathology follows a predictable sequence and can be ordered in a regular regional hierarchy. A total of 42 cases of an elderly population sample, which had been prospectively clinically assessed, were examined. Clinical diagnosis was made according to the CAMDEX criteria, and the sample reported here did not include cases were vascular dementia according to the criteria proposed by Chui et al. (1991). The neuropathological staging procedure was applied as originally proposed by Braak and Braak (1991). In addition, in all cortical laminae and regions which are essential for the staging model neurofibrillary tangles were quantified. Demented cases had significantly more areas involved and more advanced neuropathological stages. Cases with stages 1-3 tended to be non-demented, and cases with stages 4-6 tended to be demented. However, there was a considerable degree of overlap and no clear-cut threshold could be established. This brings into question the diagnostic value of the staging model.
