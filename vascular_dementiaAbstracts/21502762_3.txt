 BACKGROUND: While the prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) increases with age, little is known about the frequency of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in the oldest old. A retrospective hospital-based study compared the relative prevalence of DLB among very old individuals. METHODS: 1,100 consecutive autopsy cases of demented patients aged over 70 years (mean age: 83.9 Â± 5.4 years) were examined using standardized neuropathological methods and current diagnostic consensus criteria. RESULTS: Evaluation of three age groups (8th-10th decade) showed a significant increase in the relative prevalence of AD with cerebrovascular lesions including mixed dementia, while AD with Lewy body (LB) pathology showed a mild but insignificant age-related increase. Both 'pure' AD and vascular dementia showed a mild but insignificant decline, while DLB (without severe AD pathology) decreased progressively. While the severity of Lewy pathology in DLB slightly decreased with age, concomitant Alzheimer-like pathology increased progressively. CONCLUSION: Whether DLB in the oldest old represents a distinct group is a matter of discussion, but the relative prevalence of AD with LB in our sample remained fairly stable.
