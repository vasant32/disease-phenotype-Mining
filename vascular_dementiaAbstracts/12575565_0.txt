OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Xianlong Capsule (XLC) in treating vascular dementia (VD) and to explore its therapeutic mechanism. METHODS: The criteria of learning and memory related cholinergic nerve system, oxygen free radical and nitrogen monoxide (NO) in 35 patients with VD treated with XLC and 33 patients treated with hydergine were observed and compared with the normal control group. RESULTS: XLC could lower the acetylcholine esterase activity, increase the acetylcholine content in erythrocytes and plasma and decrease the NO content. No toxic adverse reaction was found in the observation period. CONCLUSION: XLC has definite effect in treating VD in aged patients, the therapeutic mechanism may be related with the actions in strengthening cholinergic nerve system, improving oxygen free radical metabolism, regulating NO and relieving its excitatory neurotoxicity.
