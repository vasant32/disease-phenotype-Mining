Previous investigations demonstrated that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients contains antibodies that recognize specific neuronal populations in the adult rat central nervous system (CNS). These findings suggest a pathogenic role for immunological aberrations in this disorder. To determine if antibodies may provide a means to differentially diagnose the dementias, CSF from a diversified dementia population was screened against the developing rat CNS and a cell culture system. Markings produced by AD CSF were distinctly different from those of vascular dementias (VAD) against the developing rat CNS. More importantly, some AD CSF recognized amoeboid microglia. The recognition of amoeboid microglia by antibodies in AD CSF is particularly interesting since these cells proliferate in response to nervous system disease and also engulf debris. A cell culture technique was developed to allow the rapid screening of CSF antibodies. Patient CSF produced five different types of markings in the cell culture: microglia, glioblasts, fibers, nonspecific, or negative. Correlations with these structures and the diagnosis of four different dementia populations revealed that, in comparison to the other groups, AD CSF displayed remarkable selectivity toward microglial cells. Cortical biopsies from patients suspected to have AD were incubated with the patient's own CSF and that of confirmed AD patients. Both CSF samples recognized microglial cells in the patient's cortical biopsy. The same CSF samples incubated against normal human cortical autopsy or a biopsy from a 3-mo-old child displayed negative immunoreactivity. These three approaches suggest that the presence of CSF microglial antibodies may be a means to distinguish AD patients from other dementias. The results add further support to the widely growing concept that inflammation and similar immune mechanisms may contribute to AD pathogenesis.
