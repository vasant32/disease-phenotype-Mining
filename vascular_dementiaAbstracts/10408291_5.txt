Thoracic hemangiomatosis is an extremely rare condition of the thorax of unknown origin: thin-walled capillary blood vessels infiltrate the lung parenchyma, blood vessels, interlobular septa, bronchiolar walls and pleura. The infiltration of pulmonary veins and venules induces secondary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary hypertension with a slowly progressive clinical course. This condition can be associated with vascular dementia and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
