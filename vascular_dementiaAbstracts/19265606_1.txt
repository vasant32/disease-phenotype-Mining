Recommendations for treatment with specific antidementia drugs in Denmark are given on the basis of recent evidence. Such evidence supports treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI), and moderate to severe AD with memantine. Combination therapy with these drugs can be considered in moderate AD. Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease with dementia should be treated with rivastigmine. There is not sufficient evidence to recommend treatment with AchEI or memantine in pure vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia.
