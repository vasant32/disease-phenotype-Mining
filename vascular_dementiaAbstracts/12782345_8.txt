A pathogenic role of inflammatory factors has been proposed both in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD). A previous report indicated the presence of polymorphism C-850T of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha as a genetic risk factor for VD and, associated with apolipoprotein E epsilon 4, for AD. We have assessed the association between TNF-alpha polymorphism and dementias in Italian populations of AD, VD and elderly controls. The influence of TNF-alpha polymorphism on dementia has not been confirmed in this segment of the Italian population.
