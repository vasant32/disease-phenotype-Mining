Recent data indicate that patients with vascular dementia (VaD) show a cholinergic deficit. Having obtained good results in a previous study comparing rivastigmine, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholine-sterase (BuChE), vs. aspirin, we aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of rivastigmine vs. aspirin plus nimodipine. Patients with a diagnosis of dementia and probable VaD received rivastigmine 3-6 mg/day (n = 32) or aspirin plus nimodipine (n = 32) in an open study for 16 months. Patients treated with rivastigmine showed superior benefits, compared with those receiving aspirin plus nimodipine, in attention, executive function, instrumental activities of daily living, and behavioural and psychotic disturbances. Side-effects in both groups were tolerable and there were no study withdrawals. The benefits observed with rivastigmine may reflect its inhibitory effects on AChE and BuChE, and the drug's affinity for frontal brain areas.
