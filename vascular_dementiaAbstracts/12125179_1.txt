There is widespread use of herbal medicine in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. The discussion about the benefit of these drugs is still controversial because of lack of scientific evidence. Ginkgo biloba, Crataegus and Garlic are often recommended substances for patients with cardiovascular diseases. For these substances there is a lot of data available from experimental and clinical studies, unfortunately not always adhering to the criteria of evidence based medicine. Extracts from ginkgo biloba contain several active constituents, mainly flavonoids and terpens, which have antioxidative properties and an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation by inhibiting platelet activation factor PAF. Ginkgo is mainly used in vascular dementia and peripheral vascular disease. Garlic shows a modest lipid-lowering effect in the same range as a low-cholesterol diet. Effect on blood pressure seems to be at best minor. Crataegus is often used in patients with heart failure because of its positive inotropic effect. Additionally, crataegus acts as an antiarrhythmic substance by prolonging refractory period of the action potential.
