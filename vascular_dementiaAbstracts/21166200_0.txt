 AIM: To investigate the resting [Ca2]i level and expression of calmodulin (CaM), calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMPKII) mRNA in hippocampal neurons of the mice with vascular dementia (VD) and their roles in the pathogenesis of VD. METHODS: The mice were subjected for ischemia/reperfusion repeatedly on bilateral common carotid arteries by knots to establish the VD models. Animals with the sham-operation were taken as control group. The changes of behavior were observed through the step-down avoidance test and water maze test on the day 29, 30 after the operations. The hippocampal neurons were obtained immediately after mice were sacrificed and the resting [Ca2+]i was measured using laser scanning confocal microscopy with Fluo-3/AM as fluorescence indicator. RT-PCR technique was used to measure the mRNA expression of CaM, CaMPKII in hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: (1) The abilities of learning and memorizing in model group were inferior to those of sham-operation group( P < 0.05). (2) The resting [Ca2]i level in model group was significantly higher than sham-operation group (P < 0.05), while the expression of CaMmRNA, CaMPKIImRNA in VD group was significantly reduced than sham-operation group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that excessive resting[Ca2+ ]i level and lower CaM, CaMPKII expression in hippocampal neurons might participate in the pathogenesis of VD.
