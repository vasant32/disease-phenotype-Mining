Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) soluble amyloid beta-protein (sA beta) concentrations from 69 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 23 patients with vascular dementia (VD), and 76 non-demented controls were measured by a sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using two monoclonal antibodies (4G8 and 6E10) specific for A beta. sA beta concentrations were lower in CSF from patients with AD or VD compared to those in controls. CSF sA beta concentrations did not correlate with the Mini-Mental State Examination scores in patients with AD. VD patients with moderate to severe dementia had lower CSF sA beta concentrations than those with mild dementia. Because a considerable overlap of CSF sA beta levels existed between AD and control groups, the assay is not useful as a diagnostic test for AD.
