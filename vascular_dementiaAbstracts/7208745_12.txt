The clinical and neuropathological features are reported of 7 patients with organic intellectual impairment or dementia, hypertension and ischaemic destruction predominantly of the deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres resembling that seen in infarction. The white matter changes have been dismissed as rare n the past, usually under the name of Binswanger's disease or subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy, and without much concern for hypertension. There are now indications that this sort of case may not be uncommon. It can be suspected in life on CT scans. The accuracy of assessment of the pathological substrate of organic dementia, and therefore the strategies of research and treatment, might well benefit from further clinicopathological studies.
