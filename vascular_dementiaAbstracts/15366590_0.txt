OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of Shuizhitong capsule (SZT) in treating senile vascular dementia (VD) and on changes of related physio-chemical criteria. METHODS: Eighty-five patients with VD were randomly divided into the treated group (n = 51) and the control group (n = 34) in the ratio of 3:2, treated with SZT and Piracetam respectively. Before and after treatment, the Zhang's Dementia Scoring (HDS) and Function of Social Activity Questionnaire (FAQ) scoring, cerebral blood flow and hemorrheologic properties were determined. RESULTS: SZT could significantly improve the patients' clinical symptoms, intracranial hemodynamic condition and the hyperviscosity, hypercoagulation and hyperaggregation status, lower the whole blood and plasma specific viscosity, raise the living standard of partial patients, with significant difference between before and after treatment (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of SZT in treating senile VD is definite.
