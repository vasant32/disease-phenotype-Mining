130 patients from different groups of observation in out-patient psychiatric clinic were hospitalized to mental hospitals during one year. 76 patients (58.4%) were from the register group, 54 (41.6%)--from the consultative group. It was demonstrated that the largest group of the hospitalized patients consisted of schizophrenic patients (37.7%), patients with vascular dementia (25.4%), patients with affective disorders (11.5%). Among those who were on the psychiatric register were mostly patients with functional mental disorders (schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychoses, involutional paranoid states)--65 patients or 85.5%. In the group of patients hospitalized from the consultative contingent predominantly were patients with organic dementia--39 patients or 72.2%. These data allow to develop a realistic approach to requirements for institutional services for the elderly with mental disorders.
