This study examined the relationship between knowledge and practice of healthy lifestyle behaviors in the prevention of vascular dementia. Data presented here are derived from a convenience sample of 296 participants recruited through senior citizen agencies in Australia. Lifestyle was measured using the Health-promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP). Seven knowledge subscales were developed, consistent with the HPLP. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Correlations among the lifestyle and knowledge indicated statistically significant results. However, the strength of these associations was generally weak. Multivariate analysis found that six variables explained 20% of the variance in the lifestyle score. These included: knowledge of interpersonal relations, knowledge of physical activity, medical knowledge, medical history, self-assessment of general health, and use of alcohol. The results indicate that knowledge, by itself, does not necessarily ensure that people engage in self-practising healthy lifestyle behaviors, and those who experience illness and, perhaps exposure to risk factors, had higher HPLP scores. Recommendations for how older people can be supported to reduce some of the attitudinal barriers that reduce healthy lifestyle behaviors are discussed.
