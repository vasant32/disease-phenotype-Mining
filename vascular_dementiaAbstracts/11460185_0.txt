OBJECTIVE: to analyze the clinical features and associated morbidity in a group of patients with vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: we retrospectively evaluated 25 patients with diagnosis of VD, based on the State of California Alzheimers Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (ADDTC) criteria. Clinical and neuroimaging data and laboratory test results were obtained for the characterization of the sample. RESULTS: the mean age was 68.7 +/- 14.6 years (64.0% men), with mean educational level of 5.2 +/- 4.4 years. Sudden onset of symptoms was observed in 48.0% of patients and stepwise deteriorating and fluctuating courses being observed in 4.0% and 16% respectively. Focal neurologic deficits were the first symptom in 48.0%, with focal deficits being observed in 80% on examination. The main morbidity were: hypertension (92.0%); hypercholesterolemia (64.0%); coronary heart disease (40.0%); smoking (40.0%); hypertriglyceridemia (36.0%); diabetes mellitus (32.0%); Chagas' disease (8.0%). CONCLUSIONS: we observed strong association between VD and hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The observation of two patients presenting Chagas' disease suggests that this endemic condition may be considered a possible regional risk factor.
