Isolated multiinfarction dementia is rare among general hospital demented patients who died and were subjected to necropsy (7.8%, i. e. 9 observations from 115 clinically and pathologically diagnosed syndromes of dementia during a period of more than four years). It is more frequently combined with Alzheimer' disease (18.3% of the same group). The development of multiinfarction dementia is suggested by cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease in the case-history, similarly as hypertension, a varying course, focal neurological symptoms incl. impaired speech, gait and swallowing, a positive Hachinski score. Multiinfarction dementia and Binswanger's disease may be variants of the same process.
