Geriatric medicine grand rounds (GMGR) from the University of Alberta are videoconferenced weekly to health-care providers at up to 9 urban and 14 rural sites across Alberta. A questionnaire was given to all participants attending 20 consecutive GMGR presentations from January 2002. The response rate was 85% (n = 625) for all participants and 99% (n = 123) for physicians alone. The audience was composed of registered nurses (42%), physicians (17%) and other health-care professionals. 'Interest in topic' was cited by 95% as the main reason for attendance. Doctors and nurses cited continuing medical education as an additional factor. The highest attendance was for the topics vascular dementia, behavioural problems in dementia, the genetics of dementia and falls prevention. Participants at the remote sites gave lower evaluations of quality of the GMGR presentations than those at the hub site. The measurement, care and treatment of dementia appeared to be the main concerns of health-care providers across the province. The videoconferencing of GMGR appears to be an effective method of meeting the demands of physicians and allied health professionals for education in geriatric medicine.
