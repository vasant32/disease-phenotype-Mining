A case-control study was performed to examine the association between vascular dementia and the polymorphisms of the human gene encoding sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBF2) that regulates cholesterol metabolism. The 16 genetic variants of SREBF2 were identified in 24 Koreans, and 5 out of 16 variants were genotyped in 207 vascular dementia patients and 207 control subjects. Significant association with vascular dementia was shown in 34995G/T with the GT genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.04-2.37; P < 0.05) and the GG genotype (OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.44-0.96; P < 0.05). The CGC, the most common haplotype combined with three SNPs, 24489C/T, 34995G/T, and 68891C/T, was associated with the disease (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.53-0.97; P < 0.05), and the individuals with the CGC might be less susceptible to vascular dementia than those carrying any haplotype including at least one minor allele. This study implied that the variants of SREBF2 might be genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia.
