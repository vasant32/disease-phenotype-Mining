BACKGROUND: Ischaemic vascular dementia shares risk factors with stroke. There is evidence that control of these risk factors may prevent or alter the course of vascular dementia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of regular low-dose aspirin on outcomes for patients with vascular dementia. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of hospital case-notes with further outcome information from telephone calls to general practitioners, social services and institutions. Comparison of outcomes for aspirin-treated and untreated patients. SETTING: One North London NHS Trust. PATIENTS: Seventy-eight patients with clinician's diagnosis of ischaemic vascular dementia, discharged from acute inpatient units between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1997; 38 on aspirin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival times from dementia onset to institutionalization and death. RESULTS: Median survival time to institutionalization was 28 months and to death was 52 months. There was no overall difference between aspirin and non-aspirin groups for these outcomes. When data were stratified for social status, i.e. living alone or with carer when last at home, differences emerged for those living with carer. Aspirin was associated with a trend towards increased time to institutionalization (39 vs 22 months, p < 0.09) and a significant advantage in time to death (71 vs 27 months, p = 0.02). These effects were non-significant after statistical adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results support but do not prove a role for regular, low-dose aspirin in improving both life expectancy and survival at home for patients with vascular dementia. Compliance may be better in those living with a carer. Larger, prospective studies should be performed to confirm these findings. Cognitive and behavioural outcomes should also be studied.
