BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our objective was to characterize the cognitive profile of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) matched using a functional scale. METHODS: AD and SIVD were diagnosed using the NINCDS-ADRDA and the criteria proposed by Erkinjuntti et al., respectively. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale was used to guide the identification of patients with mild dementia from a prospective clinical database. Regression analysis was applied to compare the 2 groups on global and individual cognitive domains. RESULTS: The greatest cognitive differences between the 2 groups were observed in the domains of visuospatial function (p = 0.001), working memory (p = 0.013) and visuomotor speed (p = 0.028). No significant variation was demonstrated in the executive function domain (p = 0.646). Statistically significant differences between AD and SIVD patients were found in episodic memory delayed recall tasks but not in the immediate recall tasks. A trend towards severer depressive symptoms (p = 0.052) was observed among the SIVD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SIVD patients with mild dementia have greater deficits in visuospatial function, working memory and visuomotor speed and may also be more depressed compared to AD patients. Executive function tests in general do not distinguish the 2 groups, although timed executive tasks can separate them.
