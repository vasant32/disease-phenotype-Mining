Serotonin (5-HT), a potent vasoconstrictor in the large cerebral arteries, is considered to play a key role in atherothrombosis and to be implicated in ischemic cerebrovascular events followed by delayed neuronal death. The present study aims at evaluating the relationship between plasma levels of 5-HT and vascular dementia (VaD) caused by stroke or atherosclerotic small vessel disease. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), plaques, plasma 5-HT levels and atherosclerotic parameters were determined in 20 patients with VaD and 40 age-matched controls. Age, gender, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose levels and serum levels of insulin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, leptin, adiponectin and interleukin-6 and plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were not significantly different between the two groups. Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were significantly lower in VaD patients than in controls. Plasma 5-HT levels, serum levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), max IMT and plaque frequency were significantly greater in VaD patients than in controls. There was a significant positive correlation of max IMT with 5-HT or HGF levels. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that increased plasma levels of 5-HT and carotid plaque prevalence had significantly independent association with VaD as compared with serum levels of IGF-1, HGF, LDL cholesterol and hs-CRP. These results suggest that increased plasma levels of 5-HT and carotid atherosclerotic plaques may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of VaD.
