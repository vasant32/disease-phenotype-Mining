OBJECTIVE: To investigate the availability of serum level of macrophage clony stimulating factor (M-CSF) as a marker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The serum levels of M-CSF in 70 patients with AD, 52 healthy controls, 22 patients with VAD (vascular dementia) were measured and the serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha in 32 patients with AD and 20 controls were measured as well. RESULTS: Serum levels of M-CSF were significantly elevated in patients with AD when compared with healthy controls (P < 0.01) and VAD controls (P < 0.05) respectively. At the early stage of mild dementia and middle dementia, serum levels of M-CSF were significantly elevated, but at the later stage of severe dementia, they returned to normal level. Serum levels of IL-1 beta were significantly elevated in AD patients compared with controls (P < 0.05), and serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were within the normal range in patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that serum M-CSF level may provide a convenient and sensitive means for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
