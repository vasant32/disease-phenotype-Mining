OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to conduct a meta-analysis of epidemiological and case control studies to determine whether arterial hypertension is specifically associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia (VaD). DESIGN: Longitudinal and cross-sectional prospective studies using operationalised criteria to define VaD and hypertension, with a normal control comparison group were systematically reviewed. Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, and PsycInfo data sources were searched along with reference lists of included articles and reviews. Original, prevalence or incidence studies were included if operationalised criteria for hypertension and VaD as well as number of cases with and without hypertension in VaD and non-demented groups were provided. Intervention studies and post-stroke and CADASIL studies were excluded. RESULTS: Eleven studies recruiting either volunteers or clinical patients, or which were population-based, examined a total of 768 people with VaD and 9857 control cases. A meta-analysis of the six longitudinal studies showed that hypertension was significantly associated with increased risk of incident VaD (odds ratio, OR: 1.59, CI: 1.29-1.95, p < 0.0001). A similar association between hypertension and the risk of prevalent VaD was found in the five cross-sectional studies (OR: 4.84, CI: 3.52-6.67, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension significantly increases the risk of vascular dementia. The current meta-analysis highlights the potential importance of rigorous treatment of hypertension as a key measure to help prevent the development of VaD. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
