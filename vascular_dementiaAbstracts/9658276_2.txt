BACKGROUND: With the development of pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer's disease there will be an increase in the numbers of patients requiring assessment from specialist services. Could the role of the specialist clinician be supported by other health professionals screening those who might benefit from treatment? METHOD: Sixty-four consecutive referrals to the Leicester University Memory Clinic were assessed at home by a community psychiatric nurse using a semi-structured interview. The nurse then reported her findings to a psychiatrist and a diagnosis was agreed. This diagnosis was then compared to the Memory Clinic diagnosis and a standardized (ICD-10) diagnosis recorded by another psychiatrist examining the clinic records. RESULTS: The nurse assessment procedure performed well in detecting dementia, with a kappa statistic (k) of 0.75 when compared to the standardized and Memory Clinic diagnoses. There was, however, only moderate concordance between the ICD-10 diagnosis and nurse (k = 0.46) and the Memory Clinic and nurse (k = 0.60) for Alzheimer's disease. The relatively low k value for Alzheimer's disease was principally a result of difficult in differentiating vascular dementia. CONCLUSIONS: A single supervised community psychiatric nurse, using a structured assessment instrument, can adequately detect early dementia in a sample of patients referred with memory problems. Subtypes of dementia are not, however, accurately differentiated.
