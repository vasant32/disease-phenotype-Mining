The compliance of patients with moderately expressed and moderately severe dementia, caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD), to the treatment with two different dose regimes of akatinol memantine was studied. The study included 40 patients with AD and mixed Alzheimer-vascular dementia (AD/VD) aged from 53 to 84 years. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: patients of group 1 received akatinol memantine in a single dose 20 mg in the morning and patients of group 2 received the drug twice in dose 10 mg in the morning and in the afternoon. The treatment duration was 24 weeks. The single dose of drug was as effective and safety as standard treatment with two doses. Therefore, treatment with a single dose of 20 mg akatinol memantine is recommended for clinical practice.
