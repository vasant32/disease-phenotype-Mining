Discharge diagnoses made in the large hospitals of Friuli-Venezia Giulia during a 3-year period (1989-91) were collected. Diagnoses with ICD-9 codes 290, 290.0-4, 290.8-9, 331, 331.0-9, and 437.0 were selected, and analyzed. Discharge diagnoses including one of the above ICD-9 codes were found in 6,647 cases. ICD-9437.0 (brain arteriosclerosis) was by far the most frequent code (4,731 cases). When the present results are examined in the light of literature data as well as of previous research performed at the Monfalcone Hospital, it emerges that in the hospitals of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, dementia is a strongly underestimated condition. In addition the present data suggest that in these hospitals most dementia cases are misdiagnosed as vascular dementias.
