Increased concentrations of insulin, glucose and glycohemoglobin are associated with Type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and recognized as characteristic markers of the disease; in Alzheimer's (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), and both dementia's with superimposed diabetes (AD + DM, VaD + DM) the knowledge is scarce. The sample (n = 122; males = 60; mean age = 73 +/- 7) comprised DM, AD, VaD, AD + DM, and VaD + DM patients, and healthy controls (C). The ANOVA's yielded significant differences between groups: Insulin p = 3.7 x 10(-3); Glucose p < 10(-12); Glycohemoglobin p = 9.2x10(-4). Comparisons between groups (DM vs. C, AD + DM vs. AD, VaD + DM vs. VaD, and demented DM vs. non-demented DM) resulted significant for all variables (Bonferroni's statistic, alpha = 0.05). Diabetic and diabetic demented patients presented significant increases largely different from controls (0.01 < p < 0.001), unlike the non-significant changes in their non-diabetic counterparts; linear relationships were found across all groups. The correlation's insulin/glucose and insulin/glycohemoglobin change to positive within demented groups, indicating a different performance of insulin in demented and non-demented subjects.
