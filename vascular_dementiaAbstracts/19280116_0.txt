A new method for the assessment of vagus nerve function has recently been introduced into clinical practice. In the present study we could show that, contrary to our results in Alzheimer's disease (AD), in patients with vascular dementia (VaD) vagus sensory evoked potentials (VSEP) did not show statistically significant differences as compared to healthy controls. Thus, we hypothesize that the new method of VSEP could possibly contribute to a differential diagnosis between early cases of AD and VaD.
