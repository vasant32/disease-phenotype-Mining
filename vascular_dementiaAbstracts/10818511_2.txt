Vascular dementia is redefined so as to include noninfarct vascular dementia: vascular dementia caused by underlying vascular factors other than cerebral infarction. Data are presented that bring into focus the interface between vascular dementia and Alzheimer syndrome, and the ambiguous transition between multifocality and diffuse or generalized disease. By cross-cutting both stroke and nonstroke vascular groups, arteriosclerosis, abnormal blood pressure, abnormal electrocardiogram, and other vascular factors are implicated in the distal causality of both infarct and noninfarct vascular dementia.
