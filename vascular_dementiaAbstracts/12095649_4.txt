Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic cardiovascular disorders, including cerebral ischemia. A common polymorphism of the ICAM-1 gene (K469E) has been recently reported. In this case-control study, we evaluated the association between this polymorphism and vascular dementia (VD) by studying 107 patients affected by probable VD and 115 age- and sex-matched controls. The frequency of the EE genotype was significantly higher in VD patients than controls (P=0.009). Logistic regression analysis indicated that the presence of the EE genotype significantly increased the risk of VD (odds ratio 3.25, P=0.024). Our findings support the hypothesis that ICAM-1 plays a role in the physiopathology of ischemic cerebrovascular disorders and suggest that genetic polymorphisms of ICAM-1 might be clinically important in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases.
