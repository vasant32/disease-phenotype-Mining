OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of platelet and erythrocyte membrane lipids and phospholipid composition in different types of dementia. METHODS: There were 19 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 25 patients with Binswanger's disease, 23 patients with multi-infarct dementia, 11 patients with single cortical infarct dementia, 7 patients with vascular dementia of haemodynamic type, 18 patients with dementia following Parkinson's disease, and 25 senile controls. Platelet and erythrocyte membrane cholesterol, total phospholipids and individual phospholipids were quantified. RESULTS: When compared with senile controls, the decrease of total phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and the increase of cholesterol and cholesterol/total phospholipids ratio on the erythrocyte and platelet membrane were found in patients with Binswanger's disease and in those with multi-infarct dementia. The increase of erythrocyte and platelet membrane cholesterol, cholesterol/phospholipids ratio was found, but there was no significant change in membrane total phospholipids and phospholipid composition in patients with single cortical infarct dementia. CONCLUSION: Metabolic disorders of platelet and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were noted in patients with Binswanger's disease. These disorders were related to white matter low attenuation.
