Two hundred and fifty-five cases of dementia of advanced age were studied. In 142 of them (56%) the clinical diagnosis was vascular dementia. In 55 the anatomical diagnosis was senile dementia or Alzheimer's disease and in only 40 cases with established multiple infarcts (in 38 cases they were localized in the area of the subcortical ganglia) the diagnosis was multiinfarction dementia. In 11 of these 40 cases, multiinfarction dementia was combined with senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In relation to all 255 studied dementias of advanced age multiinfarction dementia constituted 11% in its pure form and 18% in its mixed form.
