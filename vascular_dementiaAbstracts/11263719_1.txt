It is well known that abnormalities in the brain serotonin system exist in patients with dementia. The present study was performed in order to investigate whether a peripheral serotonin system marker, the platelet 5-HT2A receptor, is affected in dementia. Thirty-eight patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 13 patients with vascular dementia, and 40 healthy controls were included in the study. There were no significant differences in receptor density for 5-HT2A receptor binding between the groups. Affinity of the radioligand to the receptor was significantly lower in AD than in vascular dementia and in the controls (p = .006 and p = .003, respectively), whereas there was no significant difference between the vascular dementia group and the control group. In 12 patients, treatment with citalopram was started due to depression or agitation. This treatment significantly reduced the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale scores (p = .001), but did not affect the platelet 5-HT2A receptor status. There was no correlation between 5-HT2A receptor status before treatment and the therapeutic effect of citalopram. The study indicates that platelet 5-HT2A receptor status is of limited value as a peripheral marker in dementia.
