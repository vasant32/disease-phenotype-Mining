The authors present a family with Binswanger's disease (BD) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS). In one patient from this family, lupus anticoagulant and high levels of hemostatic markers were detected. The presence of BD and the clinicobiological improvements observed after antithrombin treatment in this patient are peculiar to this familial case of APAS.
