OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis being tested was that low doses of risperidone would diminish persistent, purposeless vocalizations in two severely demented geriatric women. A secondary hypothesis was that the severe tardive dyskinesia observed in one patient would improve after risperidone treatment. DESIGN: An intrasubject on-off-on design was employed. SETTING: A chronic care facility in Canada. SUBJECTS: Two inpatients with DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association) diagnosis of combined Alzheimer vascular dementia. MEASURES: Nursing assessment of frequency of vocalizations. Extrapyramidal System Rating Scale (ESRS) and Folstein Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: With risperidone treatment, the vocalizations diminished to less than 20% of baseline ratings. For the patient with dyskinesia, ESRS dyskinetic movement scores decreased (baseline = 27; after risperidone 8 weeks = 16). No change was observed for the MMSE. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the main hypothesis. The secondary hypothesis was also supported. Further studies of larger numbers of subjects are required to substantiate these preliminary findings.
