Alzheimer's disease is classified as a degenerative dementia while vascular dementia is known to be associated with atherothrombosis and classical vascular risk factors. However, over the last decade, there is increasing evidence of the role of haemostatic factors and inflammatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Serum markers of hypercoagulability and markers of inflammation could lead to thrombosis, accelerated atherogenesis and resulting dementia of both Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. In this case control study, we studied these serum markers of coagulation and inflammation in patients suffering from dementia.
