The aims and experience of work in a specialist memory clinic' are described with reference to the first 200 patients attending the service. 93.5% of attenders were found to suffer from dementia. 67.9% of these fulfilled criteria for probable/possible Alzheimer's disease or other primary degenerative dementias and 8.6% fulfilled criteria for vascular dementia. In the remaining cases the aetiology of the dementia was considered to be multifactorial. The memory clinic proved to be an important resource for demented patients, their carers, and for research projects.
