BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies are available that have addressed the prevalence of early-onset dementia (EOD), including early-onset Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia in Japan. METHODS: A 2-step postal survey was sent to all of the 2475 institutions providing medical or care services for individuals with dementia in Japan's Ibaraki prefecture (population, 2 966 000) requesting information on EOD cases. Data were then reviewed and collated. RESULTS: We identified 617 subjects with EOD. The estimated prevalence of EOD in the target population was 42.3 per 100 000 (95% CI, 39.4 to 45.4). Of the illnesses that cause EOD, vascular dementia was the most frequent (42.5%) followed by Alzheimer disease (25.6%), head trauma (7.1%), dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson disease with dementia (6.2%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (2.6%), and other causes (16.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of EOD in Japan appeared to be similar to that in Western countries with the notable exception that vascular dementia was the most frequent cause of EOD in Japan.
