It remains controversial regarding the association between Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism and the risk of vascular dementia (VaD). The present meta-analysis was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. The meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases. A total of 29 studies included 1763 VaD cases and 4534 controls were identified. The results showed evidence for significant association between ApoE ɛ4 mutation and VaD risk (for ɛ3/ɛ4 vs. ɛ3/ɛ3: OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.40-1.94, p-value<0.00001; for ɛ4/ɛ4 vs. ɛ3/ɛ3: OR=3.17, 95% CI=2.09-4.80, p-value<0.00001; for ɛ4 allele vs. ɛ3 allele: OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.40-2.12, p-value<0.00001). The similar results were obtained in the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity. In summary, the present meta-analysis suggests an association between ApoE ɛ4 mutation and increased risk of VaD. However, due to the small sample size in most of the included studies and the selection bias existed in some studies, the results should be interpreted with caution.
