We investigated atrophic alterations in different regions of the corpus callosum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) with respect to clinical changes. 32 patients with AD (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria), 17 patients with VD (NINDS-AIREN criteria) and 13 healthy control subjects were included. 3-D MRI sequences were acquired using a 1.5T MRI scanner. The size of the corpus callosum and its subdivisions was sampled on 5 mid-saggital slices using a personal computer-based software. Total callosal size was significantly reduced in AD but not in VD. Furthermore, the most rostral parts of the corpus callosum were significantly smaller in AD when compared to controls. Again, these changes were not found in patients with VD. Severity of dementia was significantly correlated with the size of the midbody of the corpus callosum in AD. Callosal atrophy in AD may reflect the severity and pattern of cortical neuronal damage occurring mostly in the inferior frontal, anterior parietal and midtemporal regions. Correlations between regional callosal atrophy and severity of dementia indicate that interhemispheric cortico-cortical disconnections may contribute to the dementia syndrome.
