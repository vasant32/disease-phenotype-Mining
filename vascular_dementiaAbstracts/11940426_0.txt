OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that assists in the classification of patients with vascular dementia in two of its most relevant subtypes: multi-infarct dementia (cortical involvement) and Binswanger's disease (subcortical involvement). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive patients with Binswanger's disease and 50 patients with multi-infarct dementia studied throughout a 12-year period (1986-1998) in a tertiary university hospital. The statistical model was obtained by multivariant analysis (logit model) and its accuracy was estimated by means of ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: The variables included in the regression model were: arterial hypertension (p < 0.03), cardioembolic disease (p < 0.05), and presence of cortical (p < 0.01) and lacunar (p < 0.01) infarctions in CAT. The specificity of the model was 90%, the sensitivity near 60%, and the positive likelihood ratio 5.8. The area under the ROC curve was 0.80 (0.73-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of consensus diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia, their use is very commonly restricted to the research field. We have developed a classification model for patients with vascular dementia in two relevant subgroups: multi-infarct dementia and Binswanger's disease. This model can contribute to make identification of these patients in the daily clinical practice easier.
