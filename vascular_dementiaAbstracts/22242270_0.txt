This open study was designed to assess efficacy and safety of long-term therapy with cerebrolysin in 48 patients aged 59-77 years with mild and moderately severe vascular dementia. The slowdown in the progress of this condition during the 3-year treatment period was evaluated. The efficacy and safety of the drug was assessed clinically and with the use of standard scales and neuropsychological tests. The long-term therapy with cerebrolysin was shown to be safe and highly efficacious as indicated by the improvement of cognitive and motor functions both at early and late stages of the treatment regardless of the severity of the disease. It is concluded that long-term therapy with cerebrolysin slows down the progress of vascular dementia and prevent deterioration of cognitive abilities.
