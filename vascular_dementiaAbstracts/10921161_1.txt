The raised score in the revised Hasegawa dementia scales (HDS) demonstrated that the effect of Yi Zhi Capsules (YZC) in treating loss of intellectual function after cerebrovascular diseases was significantly better than that of the western drug Piracetam [symbol: see text] (P < 0.01). The morbidity of vascular dementia was much lower in the treatment group than that of the control group (P < 0.05) after a one-year follow-up; and the blood lipid level and some indexes in rheological examinations were also improved significantly (P < 0.05, or < 0.01). The data indicate that YZC is a relatively good preparation for prevention of vascular dementia.
