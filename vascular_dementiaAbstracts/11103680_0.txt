Tau protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid was determined in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 18 patients with vascular dementia (VD), 19 patients with dementia caused by other disorders and 14 patients with major depression. Significantly (p < 0.05) elevated protein tau concentrations were found in AD patients (564.5 +/- 275.5 pg/ml) compared to all other patient groups (VD: 406.5 +/- 263.9 pg/ml; other dementia: 275.0 +/- 135.4 pg/ml; depression: 212.9 +/- 115.6 pg/ml). However, tau levels in AD patients covered a broad range (163.2 pg/ml-1200 pg/ml). AD patients with tau levels below the 25%-percentile of the distribution (among them a high percentage of patients with presenile onset) showed tau levels similar to those of the patients with late life depression. No significant correlations between tau levels and clinical variables such as severity of dementia, age, age of onset, duration of illness, and cerebral changes as assessed by volumetric magnetic resonance imaging could be demonstrated. Similarly, we could not find an influence of either APO-E genotype or psychotropic medication on the tau levels in AD patients. In accordance with other studies our results confirm elevated tau levels in AD compared to elderly not demented control subjects. Comparing groups, this finding applies as well with respect to VD and other dementing disorders. However, elevated tau levels cannot be detected in a subgroup of AD patients. This finding needs to be further investigated in future studies.
