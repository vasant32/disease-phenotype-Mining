We determined the concentrations of the putative transmitter amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer type dementia (ATD) and vascular dementia of the Binswanger type (VDBT). In ATD, aspartate and glutamate concentrations were significantly and selectively reduced, while in VDBT, concentrations of aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and many other amino acids were decreased non-selectively. In both ATD and VDBT, we found a tendency for all amino acids to increase with progression of the disease, and this reached statistical significance for some amino acids.
