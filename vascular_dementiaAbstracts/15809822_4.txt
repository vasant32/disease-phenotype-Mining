Behavioral problems produce excess disability, potentially devastating in cognitively impaired patients. These behavioral symptoms can be a major cause of stress, anxiety and concern for caregivers. While psychotropic drugs are frequently used to control these symptoms, they have the potential for significant side effects, which include sedation, disinhibition, depression, falls, incontinence, parkinsonism and akathisia. We followed up (for 12 months) a group of 346 consecutive outpatients, with a diagnosis of subcortical vascular dementia or multi-infarctual dementia. Patients eligible for this open-label study were required to have behavioral problems (BPSD). Patients were divided into two groups, Group A received olanzapine 2.5-7.5 mg/day while Group B received typical antipsychotics. Patients in both groups were allowed to continue any previous therapy. Patients in both groups were significantly improved in their BPSD. Our patients had a host of medical conditions and received numerous concomitant medications. Given the potential complications associated with these therapeutic agents, these patients tolerated olanzapine quite well. On examination of consequences of adverse events, particularly somnolence, postural instability, and postural hypotension, it appeared that cerebrovascular events were not present. Moreover, no anticholinergic effect was recorded. These findings suggest that olanzapine could be a safe and effective treatment even for elderly population in suitable doses and receiving the adequate follow-up.
