BACKGROUND: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a cell surface receptor that has been implicated in vascular disease and neurodegeneration. Low levels of its secreted isoform, soluble RAGE (sRAGE), have been regarded as a putative risk factor for atherosclerosis. In addition, administration of sRAGE has been shown to reduce development of cerebral beta-amyloidosis in an Alzheimer disease mouse model. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of sRAGE as a biological marker for Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 152 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, 91 with vascular dementia and 161 control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Plasma levels of sRAGE. RESULTS: Levels of sRAGE were significantly reduced in the plasma of patients with Alzheimer disease compared with that for those with either vascular dementia (P<.05) or with controls (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Alzheimer disease have reduced levels of sRAGE in plasma compared with patients with vascular dementia and controls. The striking reduction of circulating sRAGE in Alzheimer disease further supports a role for the RAGE axis in this clinical entity and requires further investigation.
