We prospectively investigated 100 consecutive inpatients with suspected dementia to evaluate the relative frequency of various types of dementia in a general hospital of Taiwan. Dementia was confirmed in 86 cases (86%) according to the dementia criteria of the third revised edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (greater than or equal to 1). In contrast to the western developed countries, vascular dementia (VD) (35%) was the leading type of dementia, followed by Alzheimer's disease (AD) (27%), mixed VD and AD (MIX) (14%), and other degenerative diseases (10%). Ten cases (11.6%) of potentially treatable dementia were identified and 8 of 10 had good improvement after appropriate treatment. There were significant age differences among patients with MIX, AD and VD (p less than 0.01). Those with MIX were the oldest (72.12 +/- 9.4) followed by AD (69.70 +/- 8.52) and VD (64.81 +/- 9.12). Males were slightly predominant in this series (male:female = 50:36). A comprehensive clinical investigation including laboratory tests, electroencephalography and CT are necessary in the assessment of demented patients in order to make correct etiological diagnoses which lead to appropriate treatment or management of this terrifying syndrome.
