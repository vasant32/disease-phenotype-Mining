OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) on electroencephalography (EEG) in vascular dementia (VD) patients. METHODS: According to the Hasegawa dementia scale (HDS), the severity of 46 VD patients were classified into three grades as gentle, medium and severe, in the same time, they were divided into the EA group (n = 23) and the nimotop group (n = 23) randomly. Changes of EEG in the patients were observed before and after treatment. RESULTS: The degree of normality of EEG in VD patients were positively correlated with the severity of their illness, i. e. the severer VD, the more obvious the abnormal EEG changes. CONCLUSION: EEG can be accessible for evaluating the severity of VD, and the electrical activity of brain in VD patients could be improved by EA therapy.
