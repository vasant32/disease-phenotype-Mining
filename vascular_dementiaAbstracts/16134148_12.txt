We studied 21 patients, from 18 families, with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA), a rare neurometabolic disorder with a homogeneous presentation: progressive neurodegeneration with extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, seizures, and subcortical leukoencephalopathy. Increased levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in body fluids proved the diagnosis of L-2-HGA in all 21 patients. We analyzed the L-2-HGA gene (L2HGDH), recently found to be mutated in consanguineous families with L-2-HGA, and identified seven novel mutations in 15 families. Three mutations appeared to be particularly prevalent in this Portuguese panel: a frameshift mutation (c.529delC) was detected in 12 out of 30 mutant alleles (40%), a nonsense mutation (c.208C>T; p.Arg70X) in 7/30 alleles (23%), and a missense mutation (c.293A>G; p.His98Arg) in four out of 30 mutant alleles (13%), suggesting that common origin may exist. Furthermore, two novel missense (c.169G>A; p.Gly57Arg, c.1301A>C; p.His434Pro) and two splice error (c.257-2A>G, c.907-2A>G) mutations were found. All the mutations presumably lead to loss-of-function with no relationship between clinical signs, progression of the disease, levels of L-2-HGA and site of the mutation. In the three remaining families, no pathogenic mutations in the L-2-HGA were found, which suggests either alterations in regulatory regions of the gene or of its intervening sequences, compound heterozygosity for large genomic deletion and, or further genetic heterogeneity.
