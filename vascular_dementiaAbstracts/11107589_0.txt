The aim of the study was the evaluation of the clinical usefulness of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography /TDU/ in patients with vascular dementia. The study was carried out in a group of 69 patients divided into two groups: group i of 32 patients aged 45-78 years, mean age 58.4 years with two or more ischaemic foci on TDU and dementia symptoms. The cases in this group fulfilled the criteria of dementia according to DSM-IV, ICD 10, MMS scale and Hachinski ischaemic scale. In TDU the following parameters were analysed: maximal velocity /Vmax/, minimal velocity /Vd/, mean velocity /Vmean/ of blood flow in the middle cerebral arteries, pulsation index /PI/ and resistance index /RI/. In group II the patients were divided into three subgroups according to ICD-10 criteria and localization of ischaemic foci: with cortical, subcortical and mixed lesions. The following conclusion have been drawn: 1/ the parameters of TDU could serve for differentiation of patients with vascular dementia; 2/ the PI and RI parameters in TDU are most valuable for diagnosis establishing; 3/ the transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is insufficient for differential diagnosis of dementia.
