With neuropathological diagnosis as the point of reference, the validity of clinical diagnosis was studied in 50 patients who had met DSM-III-R criteria for dementia. Clinical diagnosis of ATD (dementia of Alzheimer type) was made in 14 cases, of VD (vascular dementia) in 14 cases, of others in 5 cases and of undefined in 16 cases. At necropsy, 16 cases fulfilled the histological criteria for ATD, while 15 cases were VD, 3 cases were mixed dementia and 14 cases were other CNS disorders. In 2 other cases, the neuropathological picture was considered to be nondiagnostic. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of VD was higher than that of ATD. Clinical diagnostic sensitivity was 81.8% for ATD and 91.7% for VD; corresponding specificity was 78.3% and 86.4%. With our clinical criteria, slowly evolving VD with no clinical evidence of stroke would not be identified as VD. On the other hand, AD patients who happened to have a stroke would be diagnosed as VD. These results suggest that further investigations as to VD (its clinical course, findings of computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging) are needed for more appropriate clinical criteria.
