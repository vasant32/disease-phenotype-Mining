The purpose of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of perfusion CT (pCT) in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) from vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed dementia (MixD). pCT was performed in 41 patients (mean age, 68.3 years): 24 with AD, 8 with VaD, and 9 with MixD. Regional perfusion parameters (rCBF, rCBV, and rMTT) were calculated from 31 ROIs in the grey and white matter of the frontal and temporal lobes, basal ganglia, and internal capsules bilaterally. The obtained data for the subgroups of AD, VaD, and MixD patients were compared statistically. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of rCBF and rCBV values, pCT may be a valuable method of distinguishing between AD and VaD but it seems to be of little significance in differentiating MixD from VaD and of no usefulness in distinguishing between AD and MixD.
