In line with the current demographic trends, the number of elderly suffering from dementia is increasing. GPs have a key position in dealing with these patients at the primary care level. Different aspects of care for patients suffering from dementia provided in general practice in Germany were assessed by means of a questionnaire (n = 563). The results highlight the role of GPs in the delivery of medical and psychosocial care. However, diagnosing dementia seems challenging and co-operation could be improved. Three fourths of the GPs diagnose vascular dementia more often than Alzheimer's disease, which is contrary to what is known from epidemiological findings. One third refers patients to a specialist on a regular basis for establishing the diagnosis. Only 4% of the German GPs entertain co-operative relationships with the "Alzheimer society" and the "Brain league". Consequences for improving these for patients with dementia and their families are discussed.
