The postural control and locomotion of patients with Alzheimer-type senile dementia (n = 20) or vascular dementia (n = 20) were investigated. Patients with both types of senile dementia, especially patients with vascular dementia, generally showed lower scores than healthy old people (n = 53). Moreover, deterioration of locomotion was more remarkable.
