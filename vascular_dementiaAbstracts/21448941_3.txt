 PURPOSE: To evaluate 7T MRI in the assessment of cerebrovascular alterations as seen in vascular dementia by means of detection of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and depiction of white matter lesions (WML). 7T imaging was evaluated with respect to 1.5T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers and 10 patients with CMBs and/or WMLs were examined at 1.5T and 7T using gradient-echo (T2*, SWI) and turbo-spin-echo sequences (FLAIR). Comparisons of image quality, CMB and WML detection rates between sequences and field strengths were performed. RESULTS: Using high-resolution SWI at 7T 129 CMBs were detected compared to 75 at 1.5T using clinical SWI. With T2* at 7T 101 CMBs could be detected (33 CMBs at 1.5T). Lesion sizes were significantly larger for higher field strength. FLAIR images at 7T highlighted WMLs known from 1.5T with comparable extent. Gray and white matter contrast in FLAIR was slightly better at 1.5T, whereas image resolution and contrast of the WMLs to surrounding tissue was higher at 7T. CONCLUSION: By means of higher sensitivity for CMBs, 7T (SWI, T2*) might have significant impact on the early detection, diagnosis, and optimized antithrombotic therapy of cerebrovascular patients (eg, vascular dementia) in the future. Given the current state of technical development, 7T is approximately on par with 1.5T in the depiction of WMLs and their distribution, but holds the potential for future improvements.
