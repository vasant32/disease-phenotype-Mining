We investigated the associations of periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PWMHs) and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs) with cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), and neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. This was a hospital-based MRI300 study. We recruited patients newly diagnosed with mild-to-moderate dementia caused either by Alzheimer's disease or subcortical ischemic vascular dementia from 13 dementia clinics at university or general hospitals in South Korea. We enrolled 289 patients aged over 50 from August 2007 to March 2008. We compared cognition, ADLs, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among 3 groups according to the severities of PWMHs and DWMHs, respectively, by adjusting for age, vascular risk factors, and level of other WMHs. A higher severity of PWMHs was related to lower cognitive function and severer neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas basic ADLs were associated with DWMH. Both PWMHs and DWMHs exhibited different associations with cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and daily activities.
