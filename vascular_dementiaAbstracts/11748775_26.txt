BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD) are common during the course of dementia and present severe problems to patients and their caregivers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of haloperidol and risperidone in treating BPSD in Chinese dementia patients. METHODS: A 12-week double-blind randomised comparison of haloperidol and risperidone treatments was conducted in 58 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer's type or vascular dementia. They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 2 mg/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg/day of haloperidol and 0.85 mg/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in risperidone-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia. Risperidone may have a more favourable risk-benefit profile in view of its lower propensity to induce extrapyramidal symptoms.
