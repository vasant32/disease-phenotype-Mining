The effects of the neurotrophic compound Cerebrolysin (Cere) on cognitive performance, evaluated with the ADAS-cog, and on qEEG activity were investigated in forty one patients with mild to moderate severe probable vascular dementia (VaD) according to NINDS-AIREN criteria, included in a placebo-controlled pilot study. Patients received i.v. infusions of Cere (10 or 30 ml) or placebo (normal saline) 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Mean score of change from baseline in the ADAS-cog and percent change from baseline in slow to fast EEG power ratio (PR) scores were the two primary endpoints. Correlations between cognition and qEEG were also evaluated for both baseline scores and for scores of change from baseline in ADAS-cog and in qEEG parameters, including EEG power ratio (PR) as an index of EEG slowing. Baseline ADAS-cog scores showed significant positive correlations with delta power, theta power and PR scores, and correlated negatively with alpha activity. These correlations indicating that an increased EEG slowing is associated with a worst cognitive performance in VaD patients. Cere treatment improved cognitive performance significantly at the 10 ml dose and reduced EEG slowing with both 10 and 30 ml dosages. A significant positive correlation between PR and ADAS-cog scores of change from baseline was observed in Cere-treated patients. According to results of this pilot study, it is concluded that Cere improves cognitive performance and reduces EEG slowing in patients with VaD, and that there is a positive relationship between changes in cognition and qEEG activity induced by Cere. The conduction of further regular clinical trials is required to confirm the potential utility of Cere in the treatment of VaD suggested by the present results.
