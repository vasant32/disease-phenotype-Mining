BACKGROUND:: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) causes cognitive decline that can be alleviated by shunting, but long-term outcome studies are scarce. OBJECTIVE:: To elucidate the long-term cognitive condition of shunt-responsive iNPH patients. METHODS:: The follow-up data (Kuopio University Hospital NPH Registry) of 146 patients diagnosed with iNPH by clinical and radiological examination, 24-hour intraventricular pressure monitoring, frontal cortical biopsy, and response to the shunt were analyzed for signs of dementia. The DSM-IV and specified memory disorder criteria were used. Median follow-up was 4.8 years. RESULTS:: At the end of follow-up, 117 (80%) of the 146 iNPH patients had cognitive decline and 67 (46%) clinical dementia. The most common clinical diagnoses were Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. In multivariate analysis of the 146 iNPH patients, memory deficit as a first symptom prior to shunt (OR 18.3; 95% CI 1.9-175), male gender (OR 3.29; 95% CI 1.11-9.73), age (OR 1.17/year 95% CI 1.07-1.28), and follow-up time (OR 1.20/year 95% CI 1.02-1.40) predicted dementia. Interestingly, eight (5%) iNPH patients had dementia without any signs of other neurodegenerative diseases in clinical, neuroradiological, or brain biopsy evaluation. These patients initially presented a full triad of symptoms, with gait disturbance being the most frequent initial symptom followed by deterioration in cognition. CONCLUSION:: The novel findings were: (a) a significant risk of dementia in iNPH initially responsive to CSF shunt; (b) cognitive impairment most commonly due to iNPH-related dementia followed by concurrent degenerative brain disease; and (c) a subgroup with dementia related to iNPH without comorbidities.
