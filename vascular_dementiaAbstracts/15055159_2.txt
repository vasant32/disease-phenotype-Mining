AIM: Thyroid hormone status and thyroid antibodies were evaluated in patients suffering from dementia for further study of an association of hyperthyroidism with AD and vascular dementia (VD), respectively. PATIENTS: In 77 patients with dementia, and 42 controls, thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid antibodies were correlated with the different types of dementia and the metabolic index (MI) based on imaging with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). RESULTS: Twenty-two of all patients with dementia (29%) had borderline (TSH 0.3-0.5 mU/l) or decreased TSH levels (TSH < 0.3 mU/L). TSH values were significantly lower in patients suffering from AD (median: 1.1 mU/l) and VD (0.5 mU/l) than in the control group (1.5 mU/l) (p < 0.01). Decreased or borderline TSH levels were present in 52% of the patients with VD, but in only 10% of the controls, and in 23% of the patients with AD. Antibodies to thyroid peroxidase were positive in 16% of all patients with dementia. The MI in patients suffering from AD with borderline TSH levels was 0.81 (0.70, 0.94). In contrast, patients suffering from AD with normal TSH values showed a slightly higher MI of 0.84 (0.76, 0.89) (p = n.s.). CONCLUSION: Decreased or borderline TSH values are associated with an increased probability of having dementia, especially VD.
