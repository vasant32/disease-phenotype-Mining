Twenty-five patients with vascular dementia, 18 patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 17 normal persons were examined by magnetic resonance imaging. Lesions of high signal intensity were always recognizable and were frequently very marked in patients with vascular dementia, while they were absent or mild in patients with pure SDAT and in non-demented patients without vascular disease. The possible nature of this disease as well as the role played in determining the type of dementia are discussed.
