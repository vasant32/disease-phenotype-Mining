The levels of interleukin 1beta, interleukin 6, and interleukin 10 were elevated in the serum of patients with dementia. No statistically significant correlation was recorded in the interleukin levels among patients with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Also, no significant correlation was observed in the interleukin levels in the serum and the severity of dementia. However, a significant correlation was found between IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels and age. The levels of IL-1beta and IL-6 were positively correlated with hypertension, and IL-2 levels were negatively correlated. No correlation was found between depressive symptoms and levels of cytokines in the serum.
