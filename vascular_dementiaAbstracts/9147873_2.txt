We investigated the polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene using a PCR-RFLP method in patients with Binswanger's disease (BD), non-BD vascular dementia, or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The frequency of the epsilon 4 allele of the ApoE (ApoE4) in BD patients and non-BD vascular dementia patients did not differ from that observed in the nondemented elderly controls, but it was significantly lower than the frequency in AD patients. These results and other recent observations suggest that one or more factors other than the ApoE gene contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia in BD and non-BD vascular dementia.
