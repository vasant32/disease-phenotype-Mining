In this study, a total population, the 1957 Lundby cohort, was investigated with regard to the incidence of vascular dementia over a 15-year period, and to provide a succeeding study with basic data concerning the background factors for vascular dementia. The 1957 cohort comprises 2,612 persons who were registered in the geographically delimited Lundby area on July 1, 1957. The lifetime risk of developing vascular dementia was found to be 34.5% in men and 19.4% in women when all degrees of impairment were taken into account, the preponderance for the male sex being very obvious.
