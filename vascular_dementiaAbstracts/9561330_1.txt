In this study we present 2 postmenopausal women who showed clinical symptoms that resembled those of a rather well-defined group of vascular dementia disorders, termed subcortical dementia (Binswanger disease, CADASIL). Patient 1 exhibited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants in the ND5 gene at position 13,708 and the Cytb gene at position 15,257. These DNA variants have been described in a number of neurologic disorders, but their pathogenetic potential is unclear. Patient 2 showed the same DNA alterations and an additional mtDNA variant at position 15,812 in the Cytb gene. The principal neurohistologic features of the 2 atrophic brains presented here include: subtotal selective neuronal cell loss in the cortex and, to a lesser degree, in the basal ganglia (claustrum, putamen, globus pallidus), sparing palaeocortex and periarchaeocortex, and a very characteristic and diagnostic feature was detachment of astrocytic processes from capillary walls resulting in pericapillary space formation. These pericapillary spaces were partially filled with macrophages. The spaces were not associated with total breakdown of the blood vessel walls as demonstrated by the absence of erythrocytes, lymphocytes, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes outside the vascular bed of the brain; progressive subcortical encephalopathy, as it is seen in subcortical dementia (Binswanger), but lacking arterial lipohyalinosis. The cerebral grey and white matter revealed cuffing of arteries and arterioles by adventitial macrophages. The neocortical and subcortical changes were accompanied by myriads of activated macrophages filled with lipids. The pathology of our 2 cases differs from that of other neurodegenerative disorders and we suggest the term of "disseminated neocortical and subcortical encephalopathy (DNSE) with widespread activation of brain macrophages".
