Acupuncture has exhibited therapeutic effects on vascular dementia in our previous research. The mechanism of its anti-dementia effects involves energy metabolism. For brain cells, glucose metabolism is almost the only source of energy, and glucose metabolism disorders are early signs of dementia. In addition, glucose metabolism associates closely with glycometabolic enzymes, thereby maintains normal energy supply in brains and neurological and mental activities. In order to investigate its anti-dementia mechanism, we studied the effects of acupuncture on behavior of multi-infarct dementia (MID) rats and glycometabolic enzymes protein expression and activities in their brains. Results showed acupuncture improved the cognitive disorder, and increased the activities of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. Accordingly, it suggests that the anti-dementia effects of acupuncture may be mediated by up regulation of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase activities, influencing energy metabolic system and thus overcoming the dysfunctional cognition of MID.
