Mnestic function was examined in 50 patients suffering from late-age endogenous depressions, as well as in 10 patients with pronounced vascular dementia. A deterioration of the memory for recent events was discovered in the patients with the late-age depression, this deterioration correlating with the degree of the depressive mood, the anxiety, and psychomotor inhibition. Dynamic (affective) components were revealed in the psychoorganic syndrome structure in patients with the initial vascular dementia. Patients with a pronounced vascular dementia showed gross and persistent intellectual and mnestic impairments. Administration of single doses of melipramine and diazepam seems to be justified and desirable for differential diagnosis of late-age depressions and dementias, as well as for discovering the dynamic components in the structure of a psychoorganic syndrome.
