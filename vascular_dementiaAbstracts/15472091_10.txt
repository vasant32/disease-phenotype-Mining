BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although a strong relationship has been established between vascular disease and cognitive decline, the current challenge is to identify vascular risk factors and mechanisms that are associated with cognitive function before the development of severe dysfunction (eg, vascular dementia). This study was conducted to determine the relationship between blood vessel function and cognition in elderly patients with atherosclerosis. METHODS: Participants were 14 elderly individuals with atherosclerotic vascular disease, who had no history of stroke, cardiac surgery, or dementia diagnosis. Forearm blood flow was measured before and after brachial artery infusion of 3 vasoactive agents (verapamil, acetylcholine, nitroprusside), and these measures of vessel function were then correlated with neuropsychological performance (total scale score on the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status). RESULTS: Positive correlations were found between neuropsychological performance and vasodilation in response to all 3 agents, with 2 reaching statistical significance (verapamil: rho=0.78, P=0.001; nitroprusside: rho=0.56, P=0.038) and the third showing a strong trend toward significance (acetylcholine: rho=0.49, P=0.076). Correlations between neuropsychological performance and more conventional vascular-related variables were much weaker. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide preliminary evidence of a relationship between resistance vessel function and neuropsychological performance. With further research, measures of vessel dysfunction may be useful in identifying individuals at risk for cognitive decline and vascular dementia.
