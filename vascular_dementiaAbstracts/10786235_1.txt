The aim of the two-phase population based study was to estimate the prevalence of dementia. Among the population aged 65-84 years of the Warsaw district Mokot√≥w, the stratified sample consisted of 1,000 persons taken randomly. The first-screening phase (MMSE) was conducted by raters among 893 persons. 92 subjects with disturbances of cognitive functions were qualified to the second-diagnostic phase and 89 were given a diagnostic examination with the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination. The following age-specific prevalences of dementia were found in the age-groups 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84: 1.9, 5.8, 8.6 and 16.5% respectively. Rates for vascular dementia (2.7) were higher than those for dementia of the Alzheimer's type (2.3), mixed dementia (0.5), and secondary dementia (0.2%). In the younger subgroups (65-74 y), vascular dementia was the most frequent and in the older subgroups (75-84 y) the most frequent was Alzheimer's type. The rates of dementia were quite similar to those found in other European studies.
