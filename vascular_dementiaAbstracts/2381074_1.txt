Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRglc) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In the patients, values for CBF, CMRO2, and CMRglc have been shown to drop by 30-50% in comparison to age-matched normal controls. In the early stage (stage I), reductions in CBF and CMRO2 are prominent in the temporal and the temporoparietal cortices. In stage II, reduction in the parietal cortex also become quite prominent, and in the late stage (stage III) reduction begins prominently in the frontal cortex as well. These PET findings in Alzheimer's disease differ from those in vascular dementia, Pick's disease, and Huntington's disease. In the interrelationship among CBF, CMRO2 and higher brain function, CBF and CMRO2 decrease especially in the left frontal, the left temporal and the left parietal cortices in patients with marked language disability. On the contrary, CBF and CMRO2 decrease in the right temporal and the right parietal cortices in patients with marked apraxia and visuospatial deficits. Cerebral blood flow and metabolism are closely related to the functioning of nerve cells. Therefore we can isolate the region responsible for higher brain dysfunction and similarly evaluate the effects of treatment using cerebral blood flow and metabolism measurements.
