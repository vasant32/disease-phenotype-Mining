To investigate blood-brain barrier (BBB) function measured as an albumin ratio (cerebrospinal fluid/serum) in vascular dementia (VD) samples from 53 patients and 30 healthy controls were analysed. The VD group showed a higher mean albumin ratio than controls (8.5 +/- 3.8 and 5.7 +/- 2.1, respectively). The albumin ratio did not correlate significantly with age, nor with individual clinical vascular factors. The results of the present study suggest that the altered BBB might be a consequence of small vessel disorder rather than evidence of infarcts.
