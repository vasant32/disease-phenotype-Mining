OBJECTIVE: To probe into the effect of Huancongdan capsule (HCDC) on the vascular dementia (VD) related factors, including lipoprotein, apolipoprotein (apo) and serum immunoglobulin. METHODS: Fifty-two patients of VD were divided into the HCDC group (27 patients, treated with HCDC) and the control group (25 patients, treated with Naofukang). Changes of related parameters were observed. RESULTS: The effects in lowering triglyceride and total cholesterol and elevating high density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HCDC group were superior to those in the control group (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), but the effect in lowering low density lipoprotein cholesterol was similar in the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with data before treatment, in the HCDC group after treatment, the levels of serum apoA1 increased, and serum apoB100, IgA, IgG and circulating immune complex decreased significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but the change of apoE level was insignificant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Through adjusting lipid metabolism, HCDC could improve blood rheologic characteristics, promote cerebral blood flow, improve the oxygen carrying capacity of blood to prevent and treat VD. One of its mechanisms is increasing apoA1 and decreasing apoB100 levels, preventing and improving atherosclerosis and reducing damage of vascular endothelial cells, the another may be its action in improving immune function.
