This investigation was designed to measure learning effects in demented patients, using psychophysiological methods. Twenty-five patients with vascular dementia and 25 age-matched controls were investigated with a P300 and reaction-time paradigm. The repetition of the cognitive process discriminating between different sizes of circles led to a significant decrease in P300 latency and in reaction time. It was therefore concluded that such a paradigm is able to measure learning effects, and also that vascularly-demented patients can improve their performance on such tasks.
