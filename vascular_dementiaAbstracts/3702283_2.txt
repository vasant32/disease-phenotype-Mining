The following hemorheological parameters were determined in 68 patients with ischemic brain lesions and in 28 controls: yield shear stress, erythrocyte aggregation, erythrocyte rigidity, plasma viscosity, and hematocrit. The patients were classified into various groups on the basis of etiological criteria. The results revealed differences between certain hemorheological variables (erythrocyte aggregation, plasma viscosity) in some of the stroke groups. Plasma viscosity was significantly higher in patients with Binswanger's disease and significantly lower in the control group compared with values measured in patients with macroangiopathy and microangiopathy. Erythrocyte aggregation was significantly lower in the controls than in the other groups. Discriminant analysis revealed that plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and hematocrit were the most useful variables for classification.
