In a retrospective study of 84 outpatients with multiinfarct dementia, urinary and gait disturbances were found in 50% and 27%, respectively, and often preceded dementia and discrete stroke-like episodes by more than 5 years. Compared to patients without urinary disturbance, those with urinary dysfunction were predominantly male and more behaviorally impaired, but were similar in age, cognitive score, depression score, computerized tomography findings, and relative survival. Compared to patients without gait disturbance, those with gait abnormality had a higher Hachinski ischemic score and depression score and were more behaviorally impaired. Urinary and gait abnormalities may be markers for cerebrovascular disease and vascular dementia even in the absence of frank stroke. Damage to bifrontal outflow tracts may be the common pathophysiological mechanism underlying the behavioral and motor symptoms characteristic of vascular dementias.
