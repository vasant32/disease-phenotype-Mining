A critical analysis of the latest studies and meta-analyses dealing with antidementia agents, show that the efficacy of donepezil, galantamine, ginkgo biloba EGb 761, memantine, rivastigmine and tacrine in Alzheimer's disease is adequately confirmed. With the exception of tacrine, none of these substances are commonly associated with severe side effects. In the case of vascular dementia, the efficacy of ginkgo biloba EGb 761 and memantine has been demonstrated. Studies on the effectiveness of the cholinesterase inhibitors for this indication have been initiated. Antidementia agents can delay progression of the disease by about 6 to 12 months. Further studies are needed to confirm evidence of a prophylactic effect and a synergistic action of combinations.
