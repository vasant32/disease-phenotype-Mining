The generalized form of von Winiwarter-Buerger's disease (WBD) occasionally involves the brain. However, pure cerebral forms of the disease were also described by Spatz and Lindenberg ("Spatz-Lindenberg's disease", SLD). Both, the type I, which involves the large basal arteries, and the type II, which results in a sickle-shaped granular atrophy of the cerebral cortex, are often accompanied by ("vascular") dementia, which Lindenberg and Spatz mainly attributed to the bilateral involvement of the second frontal gyrus by granular atrophy. Recently, synaptic deprivation of the cortical gray matter has been shown to occur in the dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and other neurodegenerative disorders. In DAT, the synaptic loss highly correlated with the degree of the mental impairment. We wanted to examine whether similar changes also occurred in dementia of vascular origin, for which SLD, although infrequent, is a typical example. In fact, we found that in three cases of typical SLD type II the synaptophysin immunoreactivity of the cortical neuropil in areas without overt infarcts or scar formation was as much reduced as in Alzheimer's disease. Although it must be taken into account that in the present cases the synapse loss might, at least in part, be due to secondary (Wallerian) degeneration as a result of the neuronal loss in the "watershed" regions of the arterial blood supply, it cannot be excluded that a decline of cortical synaptic contacts in areas without necroses or scars may occur as a primary event, contributing to the pathogenesis of the dementia. Final conclusions can only be expected from investigations into further cases of cerebro-vascular disorders with and without dementia.
