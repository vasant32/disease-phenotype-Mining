Apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E) genotype and allele frequencies were evaluated in patients with late-onset probable Alzheimer's disease (LOAD; n = 64), early-onset probable Alzheimer's disease (EOAD; n = 32), possible Alzheimer's disease (pAD; n = 44), vascular dementia (VD; n = 12), age-associated memory impairment (AAMI; n = 15) and 40 healthy age-matched controls. APO-E was performed by polymerase chain reaction products digested by the restriction enzyme HhaI. A statistically significant increase of epsilon4 frequency was found in LOAD as compared to the other groups, and in pAD with respect to controls, while VD and AAMI groups did not disclose any difference as regards to control subjects. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association of epsilon4 with female gender. Our results confirm the increased frequency of epsilon4 in both probable and possible LOAD, failing to show a similar trend in VD and AAMI.
