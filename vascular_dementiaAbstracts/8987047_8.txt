Middle-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (MLSEPs) were recorded in four groups of subjects: 13 normal young controls (mean age, 17.9 years). 11 normal elderly (mean age, 66.9 years), 11 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT: mean age, 70.5), and four with vascular dementia (mean age, 79.3). MLSEPs in normal elderly showed an increase in the latency of P22, N30, P45, N60, and P100, and in the amplitude of N60. DAT patients also presented such changes; however, the increase in the amplitude of N60 was much more evident than that found in normal aging and was accompanied by a significant increase in amplitude of P45. Patients with vascular dementia tended to show longer latencies and larger amplitudes than the other groups. The increase in amplitude of P45 and N60 in MLSEPs seems to be characteristically associated with normal aging and the development of dementia. It is suggested that the mechanism of such functional changes might be correlated with the structural and neurochemical changes accompanying neuronal loss in these conditions.
