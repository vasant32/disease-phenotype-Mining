Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke and vascular dementia. Antihypertensive treatment reduces stroke risk by 40%. Most probably all antihypertensive drugs are equally effective with the exception of alpha-blockers. Blood pressure is increased in many patients with acute stroke. In this phase sudden drops in blood pressure should be avoided. The combination of an ACE-inhibitor and a diuretic reduced strokes by 28% after TIA or a first stroke. Whether this is a drug specific effect or due to lowering blood pressure per se is investigated at the moment.
