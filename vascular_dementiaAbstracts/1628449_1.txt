The enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered to be a marker of central cholinergic neuron integrity. Then, we evaluated CSF AchE activity in 90 cases of neurological diseases involving cholinergic system and their related disease, and 28 control cases without central organic lesions or abnormal findings in routine CSF study. AchE activity was evaluated according to Ellman's method using acetylthiocholine iodide as a substrate and tetraisopropyl-pyrophosphoramide, a specific inhibitor of butyrylocholinesterase. CSF AchE of Alzheimer type dementia (AD/SDAT, N = 12: 21.9 +/- 4.7 nmol/ml/min) showed no significant change from those of both control group (22.1 +/- 3.9) and vascular dementia (9: 21.7 +/- 6.7). In extrapyramidal diseases, reduction of the activity was observed in Huntington's chorea (HC, 4: 16.3 +/- 1.4) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, 4: 17.6 +/- 1.7), whereas normal activity was shown in Parkinson's disease (PD, 19: 22.5 +/- 4.6), dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA, 4: 22.6 +/- 4.2) and striatonigral degeneration (SND, 4: 20.4 +/- 4.3). In olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA, N = 16), we disclosed reduced CSF AchE activity (15.8 +/- 2.4) which had significant correlations with the atrophy of the pontine base (r = 0.6017, p less than 0.02) and cerebellar vermis (r = 0.5450, p less than 0.05) in MRI. AchE activity in cerebellar cortical atrophy (CCA, 5: 20.6 +/- 2.2) remained within the control values. Normal activity was demonstrated in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (6: 24.3 +/- 7.3) and spinal muscular atrophy (4: 22.9 +/- 3.9).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
