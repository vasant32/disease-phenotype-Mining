Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary disease characterized by recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and strokes, and vascular dementia caused by point mutations of the Notch 3 gene. Here, we report a Japanese CADASIL case who displayed limited dementia and had the Notch 3 R141C mutation. The relationship between pathogenesis and the mutation site in Notch 3 is discussed based on the case presented here.
