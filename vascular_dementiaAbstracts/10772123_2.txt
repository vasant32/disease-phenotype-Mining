OBJECTIVE: The aim was to analyze serum concentrations of apolipoproteins in the demented elderly to elucidate some biological markers related to dementia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum concentrations of apolipoproteins (AI, AII, B, CII, CIII, E) of patients with Alzheimer type dementia (AD), vascular dementia (VD) and controls (C) without dementia were compared among the three groups (AD, VD, C) and 15 correlation coefficients among the 6 measured items of apolipoproteins were analyzed. RESULTS: Serum levels of apo CII were significantly lower in AD group compared with VD or C groups. Serum levels of apo B, CIII and E were significantly lower in AD group compared with VD group, but not with C group. Analyses of correlations among the items of apolipoproteins revealed high significant correlations between apo E and/or apo CII and other items in AD group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that apolipoproteins such as apo CII, as well as apo E, might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.
