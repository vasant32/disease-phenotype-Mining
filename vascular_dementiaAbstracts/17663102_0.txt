OBJECTIVE: To search for an effective therapy for vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: One hundred and twenty cases of VD were randomly divided into 2 groups, 60 cases in each group. The observation group were treated with puncturing with needles in alignment at the hairline region and the control group with oral administration of Duxil. Hasegawa's dementia scale (HDS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), functional activity questionnaire (FAQ), nerve function defect (NFD) and main symptoms (MS) scales were used for assessment of symptoms and signs before and after treatment. RESULTS: Changes of scores for HDS, MMSE, FAQ, NFD and MS before and after treatment had statistically very significant differences (P < 0.01) in the two groups, with significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). The total effective rate was 88.33% in the observation group and 81.67% in the control group with a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Puncturing with needles in alignment at the hairline region has definite therapeutic effect on vascular dementia.
