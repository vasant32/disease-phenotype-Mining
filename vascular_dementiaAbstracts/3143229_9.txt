The corpus callosum exhibits several unusual features: arteriole-venule pairs, perivascular fibrous alae, and recurrent companion arterioles. These and other anatomic aspects are compared and contrasted with those of the centrum semiovale. Vascular changes occurring with aging or hypertension, commonly seen in the centrum semiovale, rarely develop in the corpus callosum. The vascular supply to the central zone of the genu and body of the corpus callosum, via short penetrating arterioles, is similar to that of the cerebral cortex, whereas the vascular supply to the extreme lateral corpus callosum, centrum semiovale, and basal ganglia is substantially carried by long end-arteries. When observed critically, the anatomic features of the corpus callosum may explain such clinically observed phenomena as its relative resistance to flow of fluid masses, radiation injury, Binswanger disease, lacunar infarction, hypoxia, and hypoperfusion.
