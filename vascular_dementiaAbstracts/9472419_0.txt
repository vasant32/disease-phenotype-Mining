P300 and cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitter metabolites and amino acids were examined in 10 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 9 patients with vascular dementia and 10 healthy controls. A negative correlation between P300 amplitude and MHPG concentration, negative correlation between P200 and N200 latencies and norepinephrine concentration, positive correlation between N200 latency and lysine concentration and positive correlation between N100 amplitude and tyrosine concentration were statistically significant. These findings suggest that the noradrenergic system influences P300 amplitude, and that multiple systems may influence P300 components.
