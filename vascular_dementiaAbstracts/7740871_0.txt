The circulation volume (CV) in the carotid arteries (CA) has been studied at ultrasonic duplex scanning in 219 patients with a history of acute cerebral circulation disturbance (ACCD), 26 patients with vascular dementia (VD) and in 54 healthy controls. Reduced CV in CA was registered both in ACCD and VD patients who had or were of CA stenosis. More severe fall of CV in CA for VD patients was not associated with increasing occlusion of CA. In the absence of obvious cardiac affection (fibrillation, myocardial infarction) in ACCD and VD patients echocardiography recorded insignificant reduction of myocardial contractility and cardiac output. The majority of these patients without cardiac disease or CA stenosis had arterial hypertension which is supposed to be an essential factor of CV lowering in CA.
