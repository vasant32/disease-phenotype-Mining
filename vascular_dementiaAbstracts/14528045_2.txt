BACKGROUND: Observational data have shown that the use of statins was associated with a lower prevalence of vascular dementia and of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We investigated in an academic nursing home the association of dyslipidemia with atherosclerotic vascular disease (group 1), atherosclerotic vascular disease without dementia (group 2), dementia without atherosclerotic vascular disease (group 3), and no dementia or atherosclerotic vascular disease (group 4). RESULTS: Increased serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was present in 36 of 50 group 1 patients (72%), in 34 of 50 group 2 patients (68%), in 34 of 50 group 3 patients (68%), and in 18 of 50 group 4 patients (36%) (p =.0003 for 1 versus 4; p = 0.001 for 2 versus 4 and 3 versus 4). Decreased serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was present in 34 of 50 group 1 patients (68%), in 35 of 50 group 2 patients (70%), in 32 of 50 group 3 patients (64%), and in 16 of 50 group 4 patients (32%) (p =.0003 for 1 versus 4; p =.0001 for 2 versus 4; p =.001 for 3 versus 4). Hypertriglyceridemia was not significantly different in the 4 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of increased serum LDL cholesterol and decreased serum HDL cholesterol were significantly higher in elderly patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease plus dementia, atherosclerotic vascular disease without dementia, and dementia without atherosclerotic vascular disease than in patients with no dementia or atherosclerotic vascular disease.
