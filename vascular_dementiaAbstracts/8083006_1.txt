Short-latency somatosensory, brainstem auditory evoked potentials and event-related potentials were studied in 9 patients with Binswanger's disease (BD), 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 17 normal subjects. Patients with BD had a significantly longer interpeak latency between N13 and N20 (CCT), longer interpeak latency between waves I and V (I-V IPL) and longer P300 latency than normal subjects. In particular, CCT was significantly longer in patients with BD than in those with AD. In patients with AD, only I-V IPL and P300 latency were significantly longer in normal subjects. These results demonstrate an electrophysiological difference between BD and AD.
