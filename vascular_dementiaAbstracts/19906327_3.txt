BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of research exploring differences in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD), yet these differences are inconsistent and it is uncertain whether this inconsistency might be due to the confounding effect of differing severities of dementia. METHODS: BPSD, measured with the Behavior Problems Check List (BPCL) and Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Check List (RMBPCL) and CDR-measured severity of dementia were examined using archival data of individuals with AD (N = 377) or VaD (including multi-infarct and other vascular causes; N = 74) presenting to a Sydney memory disorders clinic over a 20-year period. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in scores for AD and VaD patients on the BPCL or on the RMBPCL when controlling for sex and severity of dementia. However, severity of BPSD increased with increasing severity of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: BPSD severity is no different in AD and VaD at the time of initial assessment in a memory disorders clinic population of mild to moderate dementia. However, BPSD increases with severity of dementia in this group.
