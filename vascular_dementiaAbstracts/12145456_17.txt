Information about the epidemiology of dementia in Italy is still limited, although this cognitive disorder represents a serious public health concern. We estimated the prevalence of dementia and dementia subtypes in the elderly population of a Northern Italian municipality, Conselice, in the Emilia Romagna region (n = 1,016 subjects aged 65-97 years). The associations of dementia with two modifiable risk factors, education and occupation, were also evaluated. Overall dementia prevalence was 5.9% (95% confidence interval 4.3-7.8), exponentially increased with age, and was higher among women. Of the dementia cases, 50% were Alzheimer's disease (AD), but an unusually high prevalence (45%) was found for vascular dementia (VD). After adjustment for age and gender, education but not occupation was associated with both AD and VD. This association could not be explained by occupation, life habits, and previous history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease.
