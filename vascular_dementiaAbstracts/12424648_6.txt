The purpose of the present study was to examine possible differences in patterns of cognitive performance between population-based samples of Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 51) and vascular dementia (AD; n = 14) patients between 75 and 96 years of age. The two demented groups were comparable in age, years of education, gender distribution, and severity of dementia. The selection of cognitive tasks (letter and category fluency, Block design, Clock reading and setting, and episodic face recognition) was thought to address some of the inconsistencies in previous research. The main finding was that AD and AD patients were comparable on most tasks, although robust dementia-related deficiencies were found when comparing the results of the demented participants with those of the control participants. These findings suggest that AD and AD may affect several basic cognitive functions in an equal manner.
