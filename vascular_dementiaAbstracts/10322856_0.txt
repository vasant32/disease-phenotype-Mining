OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of Yizhi capsule (YZC) in treating senile dementia. METHODS: Sixty-one vascular dementia (VaD) patients were randomly divided into YZC and control groups. There were 32 cases in YZC group, 4 capsules each time three times a day. In control group, there were 29 cases, 2 mg of hydergine were given each time three times a day, single-blind method was used and the treatment course was two months. RESULTS: YZC could remarkably increase mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) marks of VaD patients. YZC had the effect of improving balance and gait ability of VaD patients. YZC could improve the abnormal blood velocity (BV), as well as improve cerebral blood flow, brain electrical activity monitoring (BEAM) and hemorheological indexes especially for the abnormal case. No side-effect or toxic-effect was observed in the administration period. CONCLUSION: YZC had certain effect on senile VaD, and it was safe in application.
