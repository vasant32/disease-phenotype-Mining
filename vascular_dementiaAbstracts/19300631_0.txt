 BACKGROUND: We explored the efficacy and tolerability of rivastigmine among Chinese patients with subcortical vascular dementia. METHODS: Forty subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 20) or rivastigmine (n = 20) in a double-blind 26-week trial. Outcome measures were cognition (mini-mental state examination, frontal assessment battery), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), instrumental activities of daily living, clinical dementia rating scale, and adverse events. RESULTS: No statistical significant benefit could be observed in the active group in any of the efficacy measures. A trend favoring active group was observed only in the NPI subscore of irritability (p = 0.066) and aberrant motor behavior (p = 0.068). Withdrawal rate was 30% and 15% in the active and placebo group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Among Chinese subcortical vascular dementia patients, there was no apparent cognitive benefit associated with use of rivastigmine over the 6 months period. A trend favoring rivastigmine was observed in certain behavioral measures. Rivastigmine was associated with more withdrawals relative to placebo.
