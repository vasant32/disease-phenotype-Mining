The biochemical changes such as the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were investigated in rats with global cerebral ischemia and in vascular dementia (VaD) subjects in this study. The AChE activity showed a significant decrease in plasma and a significant increase in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortices in the post-ischemic rats as compared to the controls. The learning abilities and spatial memory were impaired in the post-ischemic rats as compared to controls. Furthermore, the AChE activity in plasma was significantly reduced in VaD subjects as compared to normal control subjects. The BuChE activity did not show any change in both post-ischemic rats and VaD patients. Interestingly, the decreased AChE activity in plasma from the post-ischemic rats and the VaD subjects showed a significant correlation with the declined learning and memory ability, and the Mini-Mental State Examination score, respectively. These data suggest that the AChE activity is involved in the cognitive recovery after ischemia, and the plasma level of AChE might be a reliable supplementary peripheral biomarker to evaluate the cognitive recovery degree of VaD patients.
