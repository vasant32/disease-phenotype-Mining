Vascular dementia represents a group of diseases of great medical and social impact. Its etiology is largely unknown but is most likely multifactorial. Factors related to the brain circulation are involved. The aim of the present study was to find out if personality and social background factors might have a clear precipitating or protective value. This study comprises a total population of 2,612 individuals from a geographically delimited area, Lundby, in southern Sweden. In 1957, Hagnell personally examined 99% of the population. A follow-up study of the same individuals, irrespective of domicile, was performed 15 years later. No social background factors proved to be relevant in this study. Personality factors, including psychosomatic reactions, did, however, demonstrate a highly predictive influence on the risk of developing vascular dementia.
