BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous evidence from MRI and acetylcholinesterase histochemistry suggests cholinergic fibers are affected in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). METHODS: As a measure of cholinergic function, we assessed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities in the frontal and temporal neocortices and the immunocytochemical distribution of ChAT and p75 neurotrophin receptor (P75(NTR)) by in vitro imaging in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of CADASIL subjects. RESULTS: ChAT activities were significantly reduced by 60% to 70% in frontal and temporal cortices of CADASIL cases, as were ChAT and P75(NTR) immunoreactivities in the nucleus basalis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest cholinergic neuronal impairment in CADASIL and implicate cholinomimetic therapy for subcortical vascular dementias.
