The gene expression levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) in the peripheral blood samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease(AD) and their association with the disease were studied. The absolute expression levels of APP and PS1 genes were quantified in 45 AD patients, 25 patients with vascular dementia (VD) and 60 healthy controls by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green I. The APP expression levels in healthy controls, AD cases and VD cases are 0.026+/-0.005, 0.044+/-0.006 and 0.072+/-0.013 amol/microg cDNA, respectively; and the PS1 expression levels are 0.026+/-0.004, 0.051+/-0.011 and 0.039+/-0.005 amol/microg cDNA, respectively. Both APP and PS1 expression levels were significantly elevated in AD or in VD cases (APP, AD vs Control, t=2.639, P<0.01, VD vs Control, t=3.028P<0.01; PS1, AD vs Control, t=2.173P<0.05, VD vs Control, t=2.012P<0.05). It seems that elevated APP and PS1 gene expression is associated with dementia but not especially with AD.
