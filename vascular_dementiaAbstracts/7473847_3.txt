To better understand risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, demographic, medical, and other epidemiological factors were compared for 83 African-American women with Alzheimer's disease and 46 with vascular dementia. Overall, the risk-factor profiles for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were similar to those in other studies. However, Alzheimer's patients had a high frequency of hypertension and a relatively high frequency of diabetes mellitus. The presence of such risk factors raises the possibility that there is a vascular component to the dementia in these African-American women with Alzheimer's disease. Neuropathological studies are needed to help answer this question.
