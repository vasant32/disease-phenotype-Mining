OBJECTIVE: To study the relative specialty of the acupoints of Baihui (DU20), Shuigou (DU26) and Shenmen (HT7) in treating vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Fifty patients suffering from VD were divided into 5 groups randomly and treated by conventional acupuncture for hemiplegia, or conventional acupuncture plus needling in DU20, DU26, HT7 respectively or simultaneously. Clinical symptoms were observed, and the scales such as Hasegawa's dementia scale-recension (HDS-R), activities of daily living (ADL) and functional activities questionnaire (FAQ) were used for assessment before and after acupuncture treatment. The scores were processed statistically. RESULTS: DU20 and HT7 could improve the abilities of memory, orientation, reaction and reduce adamancy and trance. Besides, DU 20 was helpful in improving the abilities of understanding, calculating and social adapting. While DU26 is helpful in treating retardation, failure in daily activities, trance and poor memory. The combination of the 3 acupoints could improve the intelligence and social adapting ability of VD patients. CONCLUSION: DU20, DU26 and HT7 had its own effect in treating VD, but the effect of three points used in combination was the best.
