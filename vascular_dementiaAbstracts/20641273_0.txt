Acetylcholine is an endogenous neurotransmitter at cholinergic synapses and neuroeffector junctions in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It acts on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors to mediate complex functions, such as attention, memory, cognition, and consciousness. Degeneration of cholinergic neurons has been observed in several neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but not in vascular dementia. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme that terminates cholinergic actions through the rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine to choline and acetate. AChE is localized on both cholinergic and cholinoceptive neurons in the brain with the highest activity in the striatum, followed by the cerebellum, thalamus, and cerebral cortex (1). AChE has been a target for radioligand development as well as drug development because its levels decrease in AD (1,  2). For measurements of AChE activity, various labeled esters of 1-methy-4-hydroxypiperidine have been designed and evaluated as acetylcholine substrate analogs (3). Two of them, N-[11C]methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate ([11C]MP4A) and 1-[11C]methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate ([11C]PMP), were chosen for further development as radioligands for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Each has a tertiary amine structure that makes it lipophilic; thus, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB). [11C]PMP is specifically hydrolyzed by AChE (86-95% specificity) and yields a hydrophilic metabolite, N-[11C]methylpiperidinol ([11C]MP4OH), which is trapped in the brain because it cannot cross the BBB. The hydrolysis rate of MP4P is 3- to 4-fold slower than that of MP4A in rat and human brain homogenates (1), thus allowing more precise estimates of AChE activity in regions of moderate to high AChE levels. [11C]PMP is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of brain AChE activity in patients with AD and PD.
