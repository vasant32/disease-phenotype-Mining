The standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba EGb 761 has been used to reduce cognitive dysfunction. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of postischemic oral treatment with EGb 761 in a model of vascular dementia in gerbils. Daily oral posttreatment with EGb 761 led to a significant recovery of spatial memory assessed by the object location test, inhibited the decrease in plasma SOD activity and protected the hippocampal CA1 neurons, even when administered after the insult. These data provide further evidence for the therapeutic potential of EGb 761 in the treatment of vascular dementia.
