A spatio-temporal analysis has been employed on EEG signals recorded in groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The so-called Karhunen-Loeve analysis method was applied to four groups of subjects: 12 patients who were diagnosed as having severe AD, 8 mild AD patients, 10 vascular dementia patients, and 10 normal aged controls, to obtain the spatio-temporal eigenpatterns. The local difference of the global EEG pattern in mild AD patients from that of normal controls was expanded to the frontal regions in the case of severe AD. The analysis showed significant bilateral temporal functioning differences and inter-hemispheric connection difficulty, along with remarkable intra-hemispheric correlation in severe AD patients. Compared to the normal controls, severe AD patients' brains exhibit only weak local connections and correlations, resulting into limited harmonious inter-hemispheric information processing. The results from the spatio-temporal EEG study of AD patients can be considered to be due to a change in the relative activity of the brain corresponding to the pathologic variation in AD, and the results are in accordance with reported clinical studies.
