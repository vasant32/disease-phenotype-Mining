Subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI), a prodromal stage of subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD), is primarily associated with frontal injuries, whereas amnestic MCI (aMCI) is associated with temporoparietal injuries. Twenty-seven patients with svMCI, 20 with aMCI, 14 with SVaD, and 10 normal controls underwent motor intentional tasks (force initiation, development, maintenance, and termination) using a force dynamometer. Of the four motor intentional tasks, the maintenance task proved sensitive in differentiating svMCI from aMCI. In most motor intentional tasks, performances of svMCI patients were intermediate between those of controls and SVaD patients (initiation and termination: NC=aMCI=svMCI>SVaD; development: NC>aMCI=svMCI>SVaD; maintenance: NC=aMCI>svMCI=SVaD).
