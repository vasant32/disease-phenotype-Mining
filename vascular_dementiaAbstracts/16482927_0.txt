We report an 81-year-old patient with progressive dementia, disinhibition, and gait disturbance. He showed visuospacial disorientation, apathy, and gait disturbance at 76 years of age. When he was 77 years old, he was diagnosed Parkinson's disease and treated with the 1-dopa, the dopamine agonist, the amantadin, and the anti-cholinergic drug. These treatments didn't improve his motor disturbances. His motor disturbances, apathy, and abnormal behavior progressed gradually. He was admitted to the hospital at the age of 77. He was severely demented and akinetic. Sometime, violent behavior and hallucination were seen. The brain MRI showed frontotemporal lobe atrophy and severe leukoaraiosis of the frontal white matter. At 79 years of age, he became mute and bedridden. When he was 80 years old, large infarction occurred in his occipital lobe. He died due to renal failure and respiratory suppression at 81 years of age. His brain was examined pathologically. At the neurological CPC, the chief discussant arrived at the conclusion that his diagnosis was Binswanger's disease. Other possibilities discussed were FTD, CBD, and progressive subcortical gliosis. The post-mortem examination revealed diffuse white matter degeneration due to atherosclerotic change of the small artery, many lacunar infarctions, and severe infarction of the occipital lobe. These findings led the diagnosis of Binswanger's disease and cerebral infarction.
