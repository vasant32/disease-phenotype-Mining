The gaits of 15 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and 15 with vascular dementia were compared with those of 15 healthy control subjects. Patients with senile dementia showed significantly slower velocity and shorter step length than the healthy controls, and those with vascular dementia exhibited a reduction on these two variables relative to patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
