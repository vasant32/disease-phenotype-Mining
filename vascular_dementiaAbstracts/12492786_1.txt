Vascular dementia (VaD) and Alzheimer's disease share many pathological and clinical characteristics. Whereas clinical criteria can help differentiate VaD from other types of dementia, neuroimaging is required for confirmation of vascular lesions. Neuroimaging also provides information about location and size of vascular lesions that can lead to a better understanding of symptoms and may help guide therapy.
