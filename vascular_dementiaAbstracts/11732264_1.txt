In recent years evidence is increasing that vascular disease is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Moreover, presence of cerebrovascular disease may intensify the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of vascular risk factors in age and sex matched patients with dementia. We studied 109 patients with AD and 37 patients vascular dementia (VD). DSM-III-R test for dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA guidelines for AD and NINDS-ARIEN for VD were applied. RESULTS: Mean age of dementia onset in AD and VD was 65.8 SD 7.8 and 67.4 SD 7.0 years (p > 0.05), the duration of dementia, MMS and GDS for patients with AD and VD was not significantly different. Arterial hypertension was associated in 51.3% VD and 30.3% AD (p < 0.05), hypotension in 11.1 and 23.6% respectively (p > 0.05), atrial fibrillation was similar in AD and VD, coronary artery disease was presents 64.8% AD and 46.8 VD (p > 0.05) and type 2 diabetes in 21.6% and 10.1% (p > 0.05) respectively. No significant differences in serum lipid profile were found in both groups, except two times higher incidence of normal HDL-cholesterol concentration in AD compare to VD. The relation between alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and head trauma was similar in both types of dementia. CONCLUSION: Vascular disease and AD have to some extent a shared aetiology, and risk factors that they have in common increase the risk of both disorders independently and vascular disease is perhaps involved in the aetiology of AD.
