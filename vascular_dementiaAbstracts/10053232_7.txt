We investigated changes in water diffusion in the cerebral white matter of 14 patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type (VDBT) and ten patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) lesions using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and studied the pathophysiological differences between white matter lesions found in these two conditions. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in the anterior and posterior white matter and the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum were significantly higher in both groups of patients than in the 12 age-matched controls, and ADC values in VDBT and AD groups were almost the same. ADC ratios, defined as diffusion restricted perpendicular to the direction of nerve fibers, were also significantly higher in the patients than in the control subjects. However, there were regional differences in ADC ratios in the two conditions, with ratios in VDBT being higher in the anterior portions of the white matter but ratios in AD were higher in the posterior portions. The diffusion-weighted MRI technique may be useful in the differential diagnosis of VDBT and AD with white matter lesions.
