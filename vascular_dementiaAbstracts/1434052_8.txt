Serum lipid, lipoprotein, apolipoprotein, and sterol profiles were studied in 22 patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 29 patients with vascular dementia (VD). Levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were lower in both patients groups of SDAT and VD than in control group. Apolipoprotein AI and AII are two major proteins in HDL. In this study, apolipoprotein AI levels were normal, but apolipoprotein AII levels were lower in the patient groups, especially in the VD group, than in the control group. Lipoprotein(a) levels were higher in both patient groups, especially in the VD group. There were no differences of cholesterol, cholesterol precursors (desmosterol and lathosterol), and plant sterols (campesterol and beta-sitosterol) among the three groups. Murine apolipoprotein AII is a serum precursor of murine senile amyloid protein, and the apolipoprotein AII variant with proline-->glutamine substitution at position 5 in the serum of accelerated senescence-prone mice is identical to the murine senile amyloid fibril protein from amyloid-deposited tissues of these mice. In human SDAT and VD, the reason for the low level of apolipoprotein AII remains unclear.
