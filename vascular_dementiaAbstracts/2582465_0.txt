The initial two parts of a 3-volume study on cerebral ictus concerned with analysis of macroangiopathic ischaemic defects are concluded with a final study analyzing microangiopathic defects. In a group of 93 patients with status lacunaris cerebri, the authors evaluated the presence and morphology of three main manifestations of status lacunaris: cerebral atrophy (periventricular and cortical), subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy and the position of cerebral lacunae. The cerebral lacunae were mostly localized at the interphase of the individual cerebrovascular systems, which shows that their pathogenesis was due to interterritorial infarct.
