OBJECTIVES: To describe the pattern of presentation, the types of dementia and the associated conditions in Saudi patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital-based study using DSM-IV and ICD 10 criteria for consensus diagnosis of cases from clinical information and results of investigations. Dementia subtypes were made according to NINCDS-ADRDA, NINDS-AIREN and ICD 10 criteria while CDR was used for severity grading. RESULTS: A total of 77 demented patients (49 males, 28 females) were studied. The hospital frequency was 19.3/100,000 patients. The mean age at presentation was 74.6 years and age at onset was below 65 years in 17 patients. The types of dementia were: Alzheimer's disease (51.9%), vascular dementia (18.2%), mixed cases (15.6%), dementia with Parkinson's disease (7.8%) and treatable dementia (5.2%). Only 3 patients were in the severe clinical stage and infections were important causes of deterioration. CONCLUSION: The hospital frequency appears to be low probably because of the relatively young population. The pattern of dementia with preponderance of AD is similar to that in western countries and intervention directed at the risk factors for stroke could reduce the burden of vascular dementia.
