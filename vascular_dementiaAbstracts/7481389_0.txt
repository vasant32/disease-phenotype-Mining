Twenty six patients with vascular dementia were studied. Five of them only, were referred for a cognitive decline and all the others because of focal neurological symptoms or a stroke. Twelve patients had a previous history of stroke and 21 an history of high blood pressure. Twenty three patients had gait disturbances. CT scanner and MRI showed a large proportion (23 patients) of lacunar or small sub-cortical strokes. Leuko-araiosis was present in 21 patients and cortical stroke only in 6. Finally, the lack of information concerning the onset and the course of the cognitive decline in 12 patients explain the difficulties to fulfill the criteria in some diagnostic evaluation scores particularly those of the DSM III R.
