We studied the serum lipoprotein and apolipoprotein profiles in 44 patients with sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's dementia and 43 patients with vascular dementia. The levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were lower in both patient groups than in a control group. Apolipoprotein A I and A II levels have decreased in both the patient groups, especially in the vascular dementia group. The HDL-cholesterol levels correlated positively with the level of apolipoprotein A I, but not with the level of apolipoprotein A II. The ratios of apolipoprotein A I/A II have increased in both the patient groups. The apolipoprotein A II levels have disproportionally decreased in the patient groups. The serum apolipoprotein A II may involve the pathological process in the patients with senile dementia.
