We report serial CT and MRI findings in a biopsy-proven case of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) with isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (CNS). A 69-year-old man had developed dizziness, dementia, and generalized seizure during the preceding 4 years. An initial examination by brain CT and MRI showed bilateral symmetrical periventricular lesions closely resembling those of Binswanger's disease. Subsequently, the lesions expanded slowly, involving a large area of the right cerebral hemisphere with an obvious mass effect. Since a primary brain tumor was suspected, a brain biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination revealed amyloid beta protein CAA within the meningocortical vessels associated with perivascular monocytic cuffing, indicating the presence of isolated angiitis of the CNS. Multinucleated giant cells containing intracytoplasmic beta protein amyloid around a heavily amyloid-laden cortical vessel were also observed. This is the first case report to show sequential radiographical studies of the leukoencephalopathy associated with CAA and isolated angiitis of the CNS.
