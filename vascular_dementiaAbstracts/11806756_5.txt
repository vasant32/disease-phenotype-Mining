BACKGROUND: Some alterations of the lipoprotein profile have been associated with cerebrovascular disease. Recently, it has been suggested that cerebrovascular disease might play a role in the pathogenesis of both vascular dementia (VD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the possible association of dyslipidemias with VD or AD is still a controversial issue. METHODS: We investigated the lipoprotein profile in 100 older patients with vascular dementia (VD; no degrees: 60) or Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD; no degrees: 40). The patients were compared with 54 community dwelling non-demented older controls. RESULTS: After adjustment for functional status, blood sedimentation rate, and serum albumin levels, no differences in lipoprotein profile emerged between the three groups, with the exception of HDL-C that was lower in VD compared with controls. Low HDL-C (< 45 mg/dL) was associated with VD (O.R.: 6.52, C.I. 95%: 1.42-30.70 vs controls, and 4.31, C.I. 95%: 0.93-19.82 vs LOAD), after multivariate adjustment. No differences in plasma lipid levels emerged between the three groups after stratification for apo E4 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study low HDL-C levels are associated with VD, but not with LOAD, in a sample of older subjects.
