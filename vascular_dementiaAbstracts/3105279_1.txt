A number of CT head scans, covering a 2-year period and showing a variety of distinct curvilinear subinsular lucent lesions, were collected and reviewed. Variations in extent of involvement, tendency toward bilateral symmetry, and clinical background allowed the lesions to be grouped into four general patterns, most of which, to our knowledge, have not been specifically described in the radiologic literature. This project was undertaken first to bring to the attention of those involved in interpretation of cranial CT images several patterns of injury they may not heretofore have been aware of and second to attempt to derive a specific etiology for each of the patterns described. Pattern 1, which appears as a distinct curvilinear lesion (sometimes cystic) apparently limited to the lateral aspect of the putamen, is thought to represent the residua of previous lateral striatal hemorrhage. Pattern 2, occurring in a markedly younger age group appears as relatively symmetrical bilateral subinsular lucencies, which in one case completely resolved. A specific etiology for this pattern remains uncertain. Acute demyelination, either secondary to a variant of anoxic leukoencephalopathy or to a limited form of diffuse encephalomyelitis, is postulated. A third pattern, which extends from generalized deep frontal white-matter lucency across the anterior limb of the internal capsule and tapering posteriorly in the subinsular area is thought to be on the basis of chronic ischemia similar to subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. The fourth pattern, occurring as a broad band of lucency extending from the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle and also tapering posteriorly is due to relatively proximal occlusion of the lateral lenticulostriate arteries.
