The neuroprotective glial cell modulator propentofylline has been used in clinical trials involving more than 800 patients with vascular dementia (VaD). These data derive from two sources: a pooled group of VaD patients from four early phase III European trials, and a multinational European/Canadian phase III study (MN 305) that features a combined randomized withdrawal/delayed onset of progression design to evaluate the effect of propentofylline on disease progression. In the pooled studies, DSM-III-R criteria, Hachinski Ischemia Scores, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to select subjects with mild-to-moderate disease; in MN 305, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria and neurologic examinations (including CT and MRI scans) were used to select patients with possible or probable VaD. The use of a central rater to assess cerebrovascular disease in neuroradiologic examinations for study MN 305 was considered to be a key feature for reducing the heterogeneity of the VaD patient population. In addition, the inclusion of patients with possible VaD in this trial greatly increased the number of eligible patients; subgroup analyses revealed no substantial differences between patients with probable versus possible VaD, justifying their inclusion in the study. VaD patients exhibited a more pronounced placebo response in global assessments compared with the Alzheimer disease population in a parallel study. In addition, they experienced less deterioration over time with respect to cognitive and global assessments. Beneficial effects of propentofylline were consistently demonstrated in the domains of cognitive and global function for both VaD populations; however, no treatment benefits could be demonstrated for activities of daily living, possibly due to factors relating to the study population/design, the lack of a validated test instrument for such patients, the caregiver-related phenomenon of "tutoring," or the nature of the disease itself.
