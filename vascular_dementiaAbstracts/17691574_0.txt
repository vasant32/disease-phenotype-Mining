OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of warmth-promotion needling on cerebral malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity so as to explore its underlying mechanism in improving vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Forty Wistar rats were randomized into control, model, medication, needle-twirling and warmth-promotion groups with 8 cases in each. VD model was established by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries and reperfusion in combination with intraperitoneal injection of sodium nitroprusside (2.5 mg/kg). Warmth-promotion needling was applied to "Dazhui" (GV 14), "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shuigou" (GV 26). Rats of medication group were intragastric perfusion of Nimodipine suspension (0.0108 g/kg). The treatment was given once daily continuously for 15 days. SOD and AChE activity and MDA content of the brain (right side) tissue were detected with purine oxidase method, hydroxylamine chromatometry and thio-malonylurea method separately. RESULTS: In comparison with control group. SOD activity of model group decreased significantly (P < 0.01), AChE activity and MDA content increased considerably (P < 0.01); while compared with model group, SOD activity of warmth-promotion, needle-twirling and medication groups raised evidently (P < 0.01), AChE activity and MDA content of the later 3 groups lowered significantly (P < 0.05, 0.01). The effects of warmth-promotion group were significantly superior to that of medication group in lowering MDA content and to those of needle-twirling group in raising SOD activity and lowering AChE activity and MDA content (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Warmth-promotion needling can function well in resisting lipid peroxidation injury and lowering AChE activity in VD rats, which may contribute to its effect in improving learning-memory ability.
