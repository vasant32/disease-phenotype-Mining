Human figure drawings have been widely used to assess cognitive development in children. In the present study, free-hand human figure drawings were examined for 62 demented patients, and 60 normal elderly subjects. The drawings were scored for 53 body details using a method derived from work with children. A short scale of 15 details was developed by selecting body details with high item-total correlations which are simple to score even for untrained staff. This short scale had excellent interscorer and test-retest reliability and excellent concurrent validity as well. It correlated highly with the Mini-Mental State Examination, a commonly used screening test for dementia. The short scale discriminated demented and non-demented subjects and different levels of dementia severity as graded by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. However, no differences were observed between Alzheimer patients and patients with vascular dementia concerning presence of details in human figure drawings.
