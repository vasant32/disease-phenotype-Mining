Neurologic events associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPAs) include transient ischemic attack, stroke, and vascular dementia in individuals much younger than is typically observed with these disorders. The present study evaluated 27 non-elderly adults with aPAs but without concurrent disease processes or history of neurologic event and 27 age- and education-matched controls. MANOVA (p <.01) indicated group differences in executive functioning, verbal learning and memory, and visuospatial ability. In contrast, gross attentional processes and fine motor skills appeared unaffected by the <?Pub Caret>syndrome. Moreover, the frequency of impaired neuropsychologic performance was greater among individuals with aPAs than among controls (p <.01). The presence of cognitive deficits in otherwise asymptomatic patients with aPAs indicates a preclinical phase of neurologic involvement and may prove to be the most sensitive markers of the syndrome.
