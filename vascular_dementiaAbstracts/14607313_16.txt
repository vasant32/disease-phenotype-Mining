The effects of therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-I) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) disturbances were investigated by means of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The changes in rCBF were compared with the results of the medical examination and neuropsychological tests. The sample consisted of 41 patients with the Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). The effect of ChE-I (rivastigmine) treatment was studied on 33 patients, while the nontreated control group consisted of 8 patients. In the treated patients, an increase in the rCBF was observed, while the scores of the neuropsychological tests decreased slightly. In the VaD group, the increase in rCBF was more significant in the frontal regions, whereas in the group with AD in the temporal regions, respectively. In the nontreated patients, a decrease of both rCBF and scores of neuropsychological tests were observed. The scores of the neuropsychological tests correlated with the results of rCBF. Increased levels of acetylcholine in the brain after ChE-I treatment may support the cholinergic regulation of rCBF, and in result increase it. Such effects seem to be more pronounced in the more affected brain regions.
