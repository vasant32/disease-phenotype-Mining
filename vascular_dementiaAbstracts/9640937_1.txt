Genetic and environmental risk factors are central concerns in dementia research. Through twin studies one can study the relative importance of genetic and environmental risk factors. One such study, based on the Swedish Twin Registry, shows that genetic effects are of considerable importance for developing Alzheimer's disease, even late in life, but that environmental factors are also important. For vascular dementia, the results indicate that non-genetic factors are of primary importance.
