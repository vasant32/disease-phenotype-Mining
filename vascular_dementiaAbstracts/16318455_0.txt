A retrospective analysis of subtest scores on the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), a test of day-to-day memory, was completed for a clinical sample of older people. The aim was to determine whether profile and screening scores discriminated between cases classified as vascular dementia (VAD) or nonvascular dementia (NVG). Diagnosis was made on the basis of CT scan, neuropsychological assessment, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.; American Psychiatric Association, 1987) criteria for dementia. The sample comprised 74 cases with a mean age of 74: 77 years (range = 60-89). A nonparametric statistical analysis indicated significant differences between the VAD and the NVG on bath the profile and screening scores and on 5 of the 12 RBMT subtests. Discriminant analysis indicated that a combination of four subtests resulted in an error rate of 3% in classifying cases as VAD or NVG in this sample. Areas for further investigation are outlined.
