Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were investigated using positron emission tomography (PET) in 16 patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT), and compared with those of 6 nondemented and 3 demented patients with deep white matter high signal (DWMH) on T2-weighted MRI and 6 controls. rCBF, rCMRO2 and rCBV were determined using C15O2, 15O2 and C15O, respectively. rCBF and CMRO2 were significantly decreased in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex (P < 0.05) in patients with SDAT, and showed a significant correlation with the severity of dementia (P < 0.05). In patients with DWMH rCBF was significantly decreased in the parietal cortex and in the frontal white matter in nondemented patients, and in the cerebral cortex and white matter of most regions studied in demented patients (P < 0.05), whereas rCMRO2 was significantly reduced in only the frontal and temporal cortex of demented patients (P < 0.05). rOEF was significantly increased in the parietal cortex of patients with SDAT and in the white matter of patients with SDAT or DWMH (P < 0.05), and the increase in the frontal white matter significantly paralleled the progression of dementia in patients with SDAT (P < 0.05). rCBV was significantly decreased in the parietal and temporal cortex of patients with SDAT (P < 0.05), but not in any areas of those with DWMH. These results suggest that rOEF is increased in both SDAT and patients with DWMH. The increase in rOEF in patients with SDAT may be accounted for by reduction in rCBV resulting from decreased activity in the vasodilatory cholinergic system, impairment of glucose metabolism and white matter changes; the rOEF increase in patients with DWMH suggests relative preservation of oxidative metabolism compared to disturbed perfusion.
