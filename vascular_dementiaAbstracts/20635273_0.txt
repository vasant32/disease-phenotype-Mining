This study aimed to examine longitudinal patterns of VA-only use, dual VA and Medicare use, or Medicare-only use among veterans with dementia. Data on VA and Medicare use (1998-2001) were obtained from VA administrative datasets and Medicare claims for 2,137 male veterans with a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia enrolled in the National Longitudinal Caregiver Study. A random effects multinomial logit model accounting for unobserved individual heterogeneity was used to estimate the effects of patient and caregiver characteristics on use group over time. Compared to VA-only use, dual VA and Medicare use was associated with being white, married, higher education, having private insurance, Medicaid, low VA priority level, more functional limitations, and having lived in a nursing home or died in that year. Medicare-only use was associated with older age, being married, higher education, having private insurance, low VA priority level, living further from a VA Medical Center, having more comorbidities, functional limitations, and having lived in a nursing home or died. Veterans whose caregivers reported better health were more likely to be dual users, but those whose caregivers reported more comorbidities were more likely to use Medicare only. Different aspects of veterans' needs and caregiver characteristics have differential effect on where veterans seek care. Efforts to coordinate care between VA and Medicare providers are necessary to ensure patients receive high quality care.
