Cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease are the leading causes of dementia in elderly subjects. In spite of it, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis and risk factors for dementia. We evaluated fasting plasma glucose and insulin, albumin, lipids, Lp(a) and uric acid levels in nondiabetic patients of both sexes affected by vascular dementia (VD) and senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) as well as in a control group of age-matched nondemented subjects. Following a covariance analysis by gender, body mass index, albumin levels and prevalence of arterial hypertension, total and LDL cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol levels were not significantly different among the three groups. Fasting glucose (p < 0.001 and p < 0.005, respectively) and insulin levels (p < 0.05 for both differences) were higher in patients with VD and SDAT than in control subjects. Our data show that nondiabetic patients with VD or SDAT have higher fasting glucose and insulin levels than healthy control subjects. These metabolic characteristics were not influenced by differences in gender, adiposity, nutritional status, lipids or presence of arterial hypertension.
