Lactic acid concentration has been determined in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 715 patients suffering from various neurological diseases. It was found to be most often elevated in cases of ischemic cerebral infarction, cerebral contusion, arteriosclerotic dementia, metastatic encephalitis, bacterial meningitis, menigiosis carcinomatosa and after epileptic seizures. In fewer cases lactate levels were increased with brain tumors, encephalitis, viral meningitis and radiculitis. Diagnostic relevance of CSF lactic acid determination is discussed with regard to ischemic cerebral disorders, differential diagnosis of viral and bacterial meningitis and for the confirmation of epileptic seizures.
