Cerebral vascular amyloid deposits, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been found in subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger disease). A mouse antiserum, prepared against a 43-amino acid synthetic peptide homologous to the amyloid beta-protein of Alzheimer disease (anti-SP43), revealed immunoreactive amyloid deposits in meningeal and intracortical blood vessels, senile plaques, intraneuronal amyloid and preamyloid in a neuropathologically confirmed case of Binswanger disease previously reported to have cerebral vascular amyloid deposits. These lesions contained sulfated glycosaminoglycans as determined by the Alcian blue/critical electrolyte concentration method. Similar findings were not observed in a case of Binswanger encephalopathy without cerebral amyloid deposits. Our study indicates that amyloidotic lesions in Binswanger encephalopathy with cerebral amyloid deposits contain amyloid beta-protein and sulfated glycosaminoglycans.
