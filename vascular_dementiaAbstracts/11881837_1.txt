The design of this study was based on the European guidelines for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. After a placebo run-in period of 4 weeks, patients with a diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD) were randomised to receive either 400 mg naftidrofuryl/day, 600 mg naftidrofuryl/day or placebo for 6 months. The patients were assessed using the ADAS-cog, the SCAG, the NOSGER and the CGI item 2 scale. The primary analysis was undertaken on the ITT population. At the end of the study, significantly more patients in the treatment groups showed no deterioration on both ADAS-cog and SCAG scales compared with placebo (400 mg p = 0.005, 600mg p = 0.015). There were also significant differences between the active and placebo groups for the individual scales. This study has demonstrated that treatment with naftidrofuryl can slow the rate of deterioration of patients with vascular dementia.
