This article discusses the most relevant recent evidence on the prevention and treatment of vascular dementia from epidemiologic studies. Vascular dementia is the most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and remains the only one that is preventable, although most of our knowledge about primary and secondary prevention of vascular dementia comes from direct extrapolation from works in stroke. Furthermore, at present there are no approved therapeutic agents for the treatment of vascular dementia. Recently, however, a number of reasonable studies on vascular dementia have been available. It is clear that rigorous control of vascular risk factors is important in primary and secondary prevention of vascular dementia, and perhaps in ameliorating its mild form. A rational therapeutic approach to the treatment of vascular dementia should be based on an understanding of its broad clinical spectrum and the diverse causes that may be responsive to currently available treatments.
