OBJECTIVE: There is increasing interest in homocysteine as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders such as stroke, dementia, depression and Parkinson's disease. This article reviews the current literature on the relationship between homocysteine and these disorders to ascertain if any clinical recommendations can be made. METHOD: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search was made for English language publications between 1966 and 2002 using the search terms 'Homocysteine' and 'Stroke', 'Dementia', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Alzheimer's dementia', 'Cognition disorders or cognitive decline or memory disorders', 'Depression or depressive disorders' or 'Parkinson's disease'. In addition, individual articles were hand searched for relevant references. RESULTS: Cross-sectional studies consistently suggest that elevated homocysteine increases the risk of stroke, and may also increase the risk of leukoariosis, vascular dementia (VaD), cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Longitudinal studies of homocysteine as a risk factor are few and inconsistently supportive of these associations. No intervention trials to determine the effect of lowering homocysteine levels have yet been published. The pathological mechanisms for homocysteine-mediated disease await complete elucidation. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is common in the elderly population, and folate supplementation can decrease homocysteine levels. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological evidence for homocysteine as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease is an emerging area of great interest. Screening the population for hyperhomocysteinemia cannot be recommended at this stage, but individuals at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease or cognitive impairment should be investigated and treated for elevated homocysteine levels.
