OBJECTIVES: To investigate a possible implication of inflammatory processes in the development of dementia in cerebrovascular disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 26), ischemic cerebrovascular disease without dementia (CVD) (n = 11), vascular dementia (VD) (n = 11), and other neurological disorders (n = 21) using sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The CSF concentrations of IL-6 were significantly elevated in patients with VD compared with those of patients with AD or CVD. CONCLUSION: The CSF IL-6 levels are increased in patients with VD, suggesting that inflammatory mechanisms may be involved in the development of cognitive decline in some patients with cerebrovascular disease. CSF IL-6 may be a biological marker for dementia in cerebrovascular disease.
