A 72-year-old patient with von Recklinghausen's disease showed akinetic mutism within 6 months of the onset of dementia. The findings of diffuse cerebral atrophy on CT and periodic synchronous discharges (PSDs) in EEG suggested Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, autopsy findings of diffuse softening of the subcortical white matter and marked arteriosclerotic changes of the subcortical arterioles with sparing of the cortex in the cerebrum confirmed a diagnosis of Binswanger's disease. Binswanger's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of dementia showing PSDs in EEG.
