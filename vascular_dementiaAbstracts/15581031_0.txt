Using MRI survey, 163 patients with various brain pathology of vascular genesis were studied. Vascular dementia according to NINDS-AIREN classification was diagnosed in 15% of patients. Cognitive disturbances in other patients did not reach a level of dementia. A control group comprised 61 subjects without rough structural changes on MRI and cognitive dysfunction. Motor disorders were estimated according to classification of J. Nutt et al. (1993), quantitative static changes were registered using computer stabilography. The results of the study showed that postural instability occurs in 100% of patients with vascular brain pathology. A degree of its expression elevated in direct proportion to the expression of cognitive disturbances, reaching a maximum in patients with dementia.
