Population-based samples of normal old adults, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and patients with vascular dementia (VaD) between 90 and 100 years of age were given a series of episodic memory tasks, assessing face recognition, word recall, and object recall. Results indicated (a) no group differences in those variables reflecting primary memory, and clear dementia-related deficits in secondary memory; (b) no differences between persons with AD and VaD in face recognition and object recall, and (c) an advantage of VaD patients compared with AD patients in word recall. It was suggested that the ability to transfer information from temporary to permanent storage may be particularly affected by a dementing disease. In addition, the selective AD-related deficit in word recall was interpreted in terms of a greater impairment of various language-related skills in AD compared with VaD.
