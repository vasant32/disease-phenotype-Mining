 OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia (VaD). The aim of this study was to investigate the biomarkers of oxidative stress in urine, as reflected by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-isoprostaglandin F(2a) (8-isoPGF(2a)) and nitrotyrosine (NT) levels, in a group of well characterized VaD patients and in two control groups of Vascular Not Demented (VaND) patients and health y subjects. METHODS: Ninety-six subjects from the Tianjin municipality in China were recruited. Forty-six patients were in the VaD group, 24 patients with VaND and 26 persons with no signs of cognitive disorder were employed as control groups. Urinary 8-OHdG and 8-isoPGF(2a) was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and urinary NT levels were measured by chemiluminescence detection. RESULTS: Significantly higher urinary 8-OHdG levels were detected in VaD patients compared to VaND patients and healthy control subjects. In contrast, urinary 8-isoPGF(2a) levels were significantly lower in VaD patients compared with two control groups. For NT levels, no statistically significant differences were observed among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Increased urinary 8-OHdG level was a potential marker of oxidative stress in VaD patients. Furthermore, it is also important to take into account potential confounders in order to improve the identification of changes in the status of oxidative stress as related to VaD.
