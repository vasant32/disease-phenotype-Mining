Thirteen patients with different types of dementia were studied with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and CT imaging of the brain. The overall correlation between CT and NMR findings was good. Areas of hypodensity in cerebral white matter on CT were especially well visualized in the T2-weighted NMR images. Hypodense areas were seen in the white matter of patients with vascular dementias but not in those with primary degenerative dementias. Thus, the presence or absence of white matter changes may be an important factor in the differential diagnosis of vascular dementia and primary degenerative dementia. On the basis of NMR and CT findings, it was difficult to distinguish between the lacunar state type and Binswanger type of vascular dementia. It is suggested, therefore, that these two subgroups of vascular dementia be commonly named angiopathic dementia.
