OBJECTIVE: Non-target, deviant stimuli generate an earlier latency, front-central novelty P3, whereas correctly detected task-relevant stimuli generate a parietal maximal target P3. We examined whether the P3 component to novel stimuli is affected by dementing processes, and is therefore useful for distinguishing Alzheimer's type dementia (AD) from vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: We recorded ERPs to task-relevant stimuli (target P3) and novel task-irrelevant stimuli (novelty P3) in an auditory oddball task in AD (n = 16), VD (n = 16), and age-matched controls (n = 18). The amplitude, latency, and scalp topography of target and novelty P3 were compared among 3 groups using ANOVA. The relationship between P3 measures and intelligence scores were evaluated by correlation analysis. RESULTS: The amplitude, latency and scalp topography of the target P3 were comparably affected by both AD and VD. However, the amplitude of the novelty P3 was markedly reduced in VD, but not in AD, and the scalp topographics were different in the 3 groups. The amplitude was maximal at frontal sites in controls, at central sites in AD, and at parietal sites in VD. The target P3 latency was prolonged in both AD and VD, whereas the novelty P3 latency was only prolonged in VD. AD was discriminated satisfactorily from VD by using the novelty amplitude at Cz and the ratio of the amplitudes at Fz and Pz as independent variables. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the response to novel stimuli is differentially affected by dementia with degenerative and vascular etiology.
