The recognition that cognitive impairment of vascular origin is not limited to multi-infarct dementia has led to the development of several sets of new criteria for vascular dementia (VaD). We set out to define the spectrum of disease in patients presenting with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Of 412 patients consecutively seen at a memory clinic, 80 had VCI. These patients had vascular cognitive impairment not dementia (n = 19), VaD (n = 48), and mixed Alzheimer's disease-VaD (n = 13). Radiographic patterns were: white matter changes only (40%); multiple infarcts (30%); single strategic stroke (14%), and no identified lesion (16%). Of note, 19 (24%) of these patients meet none of the currently published criteria for VaD. To better understand and treat ischaemic causes of cognitive impairment, the concept of VaD should be expanded to include patients who do not meet traditional dementia criteria.
