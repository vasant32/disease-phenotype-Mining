<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain stem infarction</z:e> after cervical lateral mass screw plating has not been reported in previous literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of poor surgical technique leading to vertebral artery injury and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> after cervical lateral mass plating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-year-old male patient was transferred to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> immediately after lateral mass plating for fracture and dislocation of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed infarction of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory, and the vertebral artery angiography showed complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cervical computed tomography revealed a left screw of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae penetrating the central portion of the transverse foramen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was managed with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and supportive therapy only, with subsequent improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poor surgical technique of lateral mass plating in the cervical spine could lead to vertebral artery injury and even <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> in cervical fusion could be a complication of the usually safe lateral mass plating of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
