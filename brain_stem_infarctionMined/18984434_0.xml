<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We encountered asymptomatic large T2 high-signal pontine lesion (PL) with peachlike configurations on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine the pathogenic factors for such PLs and to differentiate PL from ischemic rarefaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the clinical backgrounds of 37 patients with PL and 100 patients without PL, including conventional atherosclerotic risk factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(3), and the degree of supratentorial deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chronologic alternations in PL were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with PL had a much higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and CKD as compared with patients without PL: 54% versus 15% for DM (P &lt; .001) and 57% versus 29% for CKD (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PL did not necessarily accompany DWMH and its degree did not correlate with PL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analyses showed that patients with PL without DWMH had a much higher incidence of DM and CKD as compared with patients with DWMH without PL: 85% versus 6% for DM (P &lt; .0001) and 85% versus 50% for CKD (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chronologically, PLs expanded, shrunk, or fluctuated in size in 5 patients with DM and CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that DM and CKD are important for PL and that the backgrounds of PL were inconsistent with DWMH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results and the chronologic alternations in PL suggested that metabolic factors other than ischemic rarefaction played important roles in the development of PL </plain></SENT>
