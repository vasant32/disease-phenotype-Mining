<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been well established that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions can be identified with diffusion-weighted imaging before they are detected on computed axial tomography or conventional magnetic resonance imaging sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion-weighted imaging for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have dealt primarily with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only limited information is available on the accuracy and temporal evolution of findings on diffusion-weighted imaging in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of lateral medullary infarction with false-negative diffusion-weighted imaging 16 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and a brief review of the literature on the utility of diffusion-weighted imaging in early detection of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases with false-negative initial imaging are increasingly more commonly reported in the literature, with initial images being obtained from 0.5 to over 24 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This delay in radiographic confirmation of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> emphasizes the continuing need for accurate clinical diagnoses, especially in the early hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, when thrombolysis remains a treatment option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may increase the associated morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
