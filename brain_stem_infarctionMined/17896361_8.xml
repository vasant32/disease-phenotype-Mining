<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the time course of diffusion imaging at the lesion site in brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequential <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans were acquired from 24 patients with brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images (DWI), T(2)-weighted images (T(2)w), maps of apparent diffusion coefficient, and maps of fractional anisotropy were generated from each <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A trend function was fitted to these measurements to model an objective, general time course of the studied parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) continuously decreased over time until a transition time around 45 hours; afterwards a continuous increase took place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the 14th day <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> reached values similar to the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of the intact contralateral side (pseudonormalization) and then further increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased continuously over 3 to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Times of transition and pseudonormalization of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> were longer than described for territorial hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and describe the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the continuous decline of FA over 3 to 6 months indicates a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> process of change of histological structures in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e>, and may be regarded as an indicator of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
