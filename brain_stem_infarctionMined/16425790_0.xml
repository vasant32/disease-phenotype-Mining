<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> (PWS) type are the most commonly occurring vascular malformations of the skin which concerns about 0.3% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These important from aesthetic and psychological points of view capillaries malformations have always been difficult for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously applied methods consisting in cryosurgery, dermabrasion, radiation therapy or surgery and skin grafting produced unsatisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was only when highly selective lasers were introduced that PWS could be treated effectively and safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A lot of available lasers and lack of experience of the health care providers result in not always proper qualification of the lesions to the given laser type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to present a prospective analysis of the efficacy of treatment of PWS vascular malformations by means of KTP 532 nm laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From January 2003 to May 2005, 155 patients (115 women, 40 men) aged from 2 to 62 years (mean age 18.23) were treated by means of laser at the Plastic Surgery Hospital in Polanica Zdr√≥j, Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the investigated population, the vascular malformation was a component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> in 7 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e>--in 2 patients, while in one case it accompanied <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1406030" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Recklinghausen</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vascular lesions had not been treated before in majority of cases, while in 37 patients the laser therapy was the continuation of other previously attempted treatment, which included excision and skin grafting, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> laser therapy, radiation therapy and pulsed dye laser treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The procedures were performed with at least 4-week intervals without, or under local and in children general anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated independently by 3 surgeons and a photographer on the basis of Subjective Scoring System (SSS) comparing simultaneously shown pictures of the patients taken prior to and after the last procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of treatment were classified according to a 4-degree scale: excellent outcome--75-100% improvement, with 100% perceived as eradication of the lesion; good--50-74% improvement; fair--25-49% improvement and poor--less than 25% improvement, including no observable improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 81% of the lesions (126 patients) treatment with KTP 532 nm laser produced significant improvement which was found satisfactory by the patient. excellent outcome of treatment was obtained in 49 patients (31%), good in 42 (27%), fair in 35 (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, despite many laser treatments using various energy and pulse duration, there was almost not observable improvement in 19% of the study population (29 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The PWS which failed to treatment were most commonly located on the limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The results of treatment was poor in 74% of malformations which were located beyond the face and neck (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were on the limbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> or persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentary changes</z:hpo> in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>KTP (532 nm) laser is an effective and safe tool in the management of capillary malformations of PWS type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The treatment is especially effective in adults and in lesions localized to the face and neck area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>Port-wine stain</z:hpo> localized on the trunk and extremities often appears to be KTP laser resistant </plain></SENT>
