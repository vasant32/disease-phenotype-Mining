<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The role of surgery and intervention in current management is still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to review our experience of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were identified using the health board database of inpatient admissions between 1999 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical notes were reviewed and data collected looking at patient demographics, site of lesion, clinical findings, investigative procedures, intervention and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 288 patients were identified with a diagnosis of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Haemangioma</z:e>" or "vascular malformation" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight of these patients were found to have limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangiomas</z:e> or vascular malformations (20 boys and 18 girls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age at referral was 1.9 years (0-13.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gigantism</z:e>, swelling, <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>bruising</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and cosmetic concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cosmetic concerns and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> being the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Investigative modalities were used in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These included ultrasound, CT, MRI and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many patients had more then one imaging modality employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment options included observation, steroids, laser, embolisation and surgical excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (66%) required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most patients were required one or two procedures, mainly laser or simple excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However two patients required multiple procedures while one patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221025" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kasabach-Merritt syndrome</z:e> required a limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed-up for a median of 3.75 years (0.08-14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Two patients were noted to have related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological problems</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Haemangiomas</z:e> and vascular malformations of the limb can be associated with significant functional impairment, especially if they are extending to deeper tissue planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Such patients are likely to require surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For many patients referred to tertiary care, surgery is still the mainstay of treatment and the only curative option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Serious complications were more common in patients with arterio-venous malformations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221025" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kasabach-Merritt syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Two of 38 patients (5.3%) were referred for formal psychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Given the potential for psychological morbidity we fear this is an aspect of care that may be under-recognised and require further specialist input </plain></SENT>
