<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe herein two cases of vascular malformations, one classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> and the other as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical investigation in each case failed to demonstrate the presence of arteriovenous (AV) shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriographic findings revealed only indirect evidence of AV shunting in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, systematic scanning with a Doppler ultrasonographic probe of the involved extremities provided evidence of AV shunting and pinpointed it in suspected arteriographic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good correlation between the two methods was confirmed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> case both preoperatively and intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e>, evidence of multiple AV shunts was obtained primarily with Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to arteriography, serial phlebography, when indicated, is also necessary for complete evaluation of concomitant venous malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic mechanism of these vascular malformations was briefly reviewed, emphasizing AV shunting as a common link between the various anatomicoclinical forms </plain></SENT>
