<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case report which includes a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, cerebral MRI, the investigation of parameters for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e> of blood coagulation, structural and numerical analyses of chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three typical symptoms of KTPW were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An old cerebral insult in the thalamus with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> was established with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The direction of the venous drainage in the fusiform arterial-venous malformation of conjunctiva in the right eye has been changed during the observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dilated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> veins were observed in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography of the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Structural changes in karyograms were also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The congenital arterial-venous malformation in conjunctiva has been changed through <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during our long observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy or surgical therapy of pathologic veins in childhood, should be recommended </plain></SENT>
