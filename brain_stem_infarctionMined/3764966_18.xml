<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed for definite vertebrobasilar (VB) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in 19 (43%), for VB <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 13 (30%) and for non localizing symptoms in 12 (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stenosis in the BA with or without VA involvement was present in 28 patients (64%), while 16 patients (36%) had occlusive disease in one or both distal VA sparing the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In follow up, 7 patients (16%) had definite VB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and 3 patients had possible VB <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (18%) sustained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 5 of which were in the VB territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 17 times the expected rate for a matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients died during follow up, three patients due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (2 brainstem infarctions, one <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observed 5 year survival rate was 78% compared to 90% in a matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparing this data with our previous study of 93 patients with proximal VA occlusive disease, distal VB occlusive disease appears to carry a higher risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
