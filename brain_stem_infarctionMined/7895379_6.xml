<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>acoustic neuroma</z:hpo> was found in 52 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1988, the translabyrinthine approach was modified into the transotic approach and replaced the former technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality in this series, but two patients had mild brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and there was post-operative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> into the cerebellopontine angle in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage was seen in six patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> in their legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was one case each of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> of the cerebellum and gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-operative facial nerve function was good in 88%, moderate in 10% and poor in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>acoustic neuromas</z:hpo> the aim was total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> removal, but if there was a serious risk of damaging the nerve anatomically, near total or subtotal removal was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the study period, there was a gradual decrease in facial nerve morbidity and surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to increasing experience, the modified wider approach and better post-operative care </plain></SENT>
