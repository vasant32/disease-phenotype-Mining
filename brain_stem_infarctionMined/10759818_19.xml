<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although surgical extirpation is the standard method for the treatment of vascular malformations, this procedure often leads to loss of motor function, nerve damage, and massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> if the excision is extensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sclerotherapy is an alternative method of treatment for venous malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the effect of color duplex ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy on venous malformations and the coagulability induced by sclerosing solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with venous malformations underwent percutaneous sclerotherapy by direct puncture under duplex ultrasound guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous catheters were inserted into duplex ultrasound-confirmed venous spaces and fine plastic tubing filled with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was attached to the needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the needle tip was observed to pierce the vein wall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of the blood confirmed its intraluminal position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean volume of 3.6 ml of 3% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subfascial ligation of the lateral marginal venous collector was performed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>D-dimer (DD) and thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) were measured preoperatively and on the first and fifth postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The head and neck, which was the most common site of venous malformations were involved in 57% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Venous malformations disappeared in 44% of the patients and decreased in 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Localized pain was the most common complication, occuring in 82% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sclerotherapy for venous malformations produced significant swelling in 75% of the patients, which required 5-7 days to subside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Significant differences were detected in both DD and TAT concentrations on the first and fifth postoperative days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Color duplex-guided sclerotherapy was effective in 82% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This procedure prevents intra-arterial injection accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although patients with venous malformations showed greater coagulability, no serious thrombotic sequelae were found </plain></SENT>
