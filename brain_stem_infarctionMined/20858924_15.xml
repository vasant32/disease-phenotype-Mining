<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A brain-computer interface (BCI) uses brain signals, rather than muscles, to re-establish communication with the outside world </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been widely assumed that this method does not depend on the ability to focus on the desired character, because it was thought that it relies primarily on the P300-evoked potential and minimally, if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, on other EEG features such as the visual-evoked potential (VEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This issue is highly relevant for the clinical application of this BCI method, because eye movements may be impaired or lost in the relevant user population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the extent to which the performance in a 'P300' speller BCI depends on eye gaze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the performance of 17 healthy subjects using a 'P300' matrix speller under two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under one condition ('letter'), the subjects focused their eye gaze on the intended letter, while under the second condition ('center'), the subjects focused their eye gaze on a fixation cross that was located in the center of the matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show that the performance of the 'P300' matrix speller in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects depends in considerable measure on gaze direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They thereby disprove a widespread assumption in BCI research, and suggest that this BCI might function more effectively for people who retain some eye-movement control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The applicability of these findings to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities (particularly in eye-movements) remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
