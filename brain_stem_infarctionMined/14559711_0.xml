<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define the arteriographic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e> sydrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>) and explore the feasibility of the treatment with intravascular administration of pingyangmycin lipiodol emulsion (PLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> underwent arteriography followed by therapy with PLE administration (containing pingyangmycin 8-16 mg and lipiodol 4-6 ml) into the trunk of the arteries of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> impaired extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect and postoperative complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arteriography revealed abundant small branches of the runoff arteries, showing sinusoid changes of varied sizes in 5 cases by staining of the soft tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the 3 to 30-month follow-up, swelling of the extremities was obviously improved in 5 cases after PLE therapy, which failed to produce obvious effect in 1 case and recurrence was detected in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> of the limbs, serum transaminase disorder and local skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arteriography can detect the lesions of the arteries and soft tissues in the affected extremity of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, intravascular administration of PLE was effective to alleviate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the limbs </plain></SENT>
