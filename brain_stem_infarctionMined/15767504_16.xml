<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although capacities for intensive monitoring of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are still limited, patients at risk for early neurologic worsening are poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify patients at risk for neurologic worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: An inception cohort was assessed using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIH-SS) at hospital admission and again 48 to 72 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Eleven neurologic departments with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: A total of 1964 consecutive patients admitted within 4 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Underlying reasons for and possible predictors of neurologic worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 256 patients (13.0%) had an increased score of 1 point or more on the NIH-SS after 48 to 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurologic worsening was attributed to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 33.6% of patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in 27.3%, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in 11.3%, and secondary parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 10.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, medial cerebral artery (M1) occlusion, territorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infarction, brainstem</z:e> infarction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> as independent predictors of neurologic worsening on the NIH-SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Worsening of key neurologic functions (consciousness, gaze, arm or leg motor function, and speech) occurred in 223 patients (11.4%), and worsening of 4 points or more on the NIH-SS total score occurred in 148 patients (7.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Besides initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and comorbid conditions, ultrasound and imaging can provide valuable information about the risk of worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and thus can identify patients who could benefit most from intensive monitoring </plain></SENT>
