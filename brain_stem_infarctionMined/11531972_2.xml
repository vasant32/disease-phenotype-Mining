<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among clinical symptoms, maculopapular <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, known as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001014'>angiokeratoma</z:hpo>, most often appear on the lower abdomen, scrotum, and thighs, with a tendency toward bilateral symmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 30-year-old male patient was referred to us for evaluation of a complex vascular and cutaneous malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Skin examination showed numerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001014'>angiokeratoma</z:hpo>, which had developed only on the right part of the body, with a sharp delineation in the midline of the trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> was confirmed by demonstration of a decreased alpha-galactosidase A activity, and the patient was shown to be hemizygote for a missense mutation (R342Q) in the alpha-galactosidase A gene (GLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation was also demonstrated in DNA extracted from fibroblast cultures established from both affected and unaffected skin areas, thus excluding the hypothesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> mosaicism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the diagnosis of Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã©naunay-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> (KTWS) was also made, through clinical and radiological investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report on the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> and KTWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the mixed vascular malformations of KTWS affecting capillary and venous systems have contributed to the unusual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001014'>angiokeratoma</z:hpo> distribution pattern observed in the patient </plain></SENT>
