<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Teleangiectases are the source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in many HHT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most frequent site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is the nose and more than 90% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals with HHT suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004406'>recurrent epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> efforts, treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in HHT continues to be a problem for many otorhinolaryngologists, who can alleviate recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>nosebleeds</z:hpo> by Septodermoplasty or laser therapy, but rarely can stop nasal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> permanently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recurrence is almost inevitable, but the mechanisms of recurrence are not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prior to routine Nd:YAG laser therapy of nasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> the nasal mucosa of 17 patients with HHT according to the clinical diagnostic criteria of the HHT Foundation International was examined with a 0 degrees contact rhinoscope in areas with clinically visible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> as well as in clinically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The digitally recorded images were compared to findings of a group of five healthy volunteers and the findings of five patients with polypoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visualization of subepithelial vessels was feasible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals of the study group as well as the control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dilated vascular loops and tortuous vessels could be found in the study groups as well as in the control group, but the overall density of telangiectatic vessels was on an average higher in the HHT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The process of vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and tortuous configuration seemed to progress with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contact endoscopy allows the investigation of the angioarchitecture of capillaries of the nasal mucosa in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This observation may be of significance for studies of nasal diseases, which are accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With this regard it seems to be of special interest for studies of HHT </plain></SENT>
