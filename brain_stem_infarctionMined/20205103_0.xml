<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can be inherited (25%) and be part of multi-<z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> syndromes such as MEN2 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019562" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau</z:e> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paraganglioma</z:hpo> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation can sometimes be atypical and does not always allow proper diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such situations, DNA analysis can be helpful, especially when the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> is the first and only symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed DNA from 60 patients diagnosed and treated in the Centre of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002666'>pheochromocytoma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paraganglioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis was carried out for RET (exons 10, 11, 13, and 16), SDHB, SDHD, and VHL genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Techniques used for the analysis were direct sequence analysis, MSSCP, and RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Germinal mutations were found in 16 patients (26,7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most frequent were mutations in RET proto-oncogene, followed by VHL gene, one mutation in SDHB, and one in SDHD genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A comparison of some of the clinical features of both groups (with and without mutation) showed statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that genetic predisposition is frequent in chromaffin tissue <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e>, which indicates that DNA analysis is necessary in every case, also because of possible atypical clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
