<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with a premorbid modified Rankin score &lt; or = 1 and NIHSS between 5 and 22 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had admission CT, CTA, and CT perfusion scans to evaluate for salvageable brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization effectiveness was assessed by angiograms obtained within 30 hours after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient, treatment characteristics, and immediate and 3-month outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean NIHSS at presentation was 13 (median=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean interval between time last-seen well and angiogram was 12.75 hours (median=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients (86.7%) presented with complete-to-near-complete vessel occlusion (thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] 0/1); 4 had partial vessel occlusion (TIMI 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions included intra-arterial pharmacological thrombolysis (n=10), mechanical thrombectomy(n=21; Merci, 16; intracranial stent, 9; extracranial stent, 3), angioplasty (n=14; intracranial, 11; extracranial, 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Partial-to-complete recanalization (TIMI 2/3) was achieved in 20 patients (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications included vascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> (n=3) and femoral access site complication (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had an embolic anterior cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> during intervention; another had progression of brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 3 patients (10%), with 2 being primarily subarachnoid in location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Total in-hospital mortality including procedural mortality, disease progression, or other comorbidities was 23.3% (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mean discharge NIHSS was 9.5, representing an overall NIHSS 3.5-point improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall, mean modified Rankin score at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or last follow-up (mean=10.6 months) was 4.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, total mortality was 33.3% (n=10), 20% had modified Rankin score &lt; or = 2, and 33% had modified Rankin score &lt; or = 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among survivors, mean modified Rankin score at 3-month follow-up was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that delayed endovascular revascularization of carefully selected patients is safe, effective, and improves clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
