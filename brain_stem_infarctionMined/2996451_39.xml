<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> secondary to deep venous obstruction has been suggested as a cause, recent studies have demonstrated that most patients have unimpeded venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calf blood flows have been measured in 33 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> using venous occlusion plethysmography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> flow rates were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits, flow in affected limbs was invariably greater than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limbs (p less than 0.001), and this is related to the presence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>nevus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> is caused by mesodermal abnormality during fetal development, leading to the maintenance of microscopic arteriovenous communications in the limb bud, as a result of which the triad of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>nevus</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> is produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> occur pari passu with the triad and are not responsible for its development </plain></SENT>
