<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed a striking visual and motor behaviour in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving the territory of the right anterior parietal artery (postcentral gyrus, parts or upper and middle temporal gyri, anterior part of inferior parietal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients concentrated on the left side of their bodies, looking at it for long periods and relentlessly rubbing, touching, pinching, pressing, lifting, and manipulating parts of the left arm, trunk, and leg with their right hand or foot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had severe loss of elementary sensation on the left (touch, pain, temperature, vibration, position) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The behaviour was not associated with overinterest in the left hemispace apart from their own bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It lasted no more than a few days, disappearing when left sided sensation improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest an association between sensory dysfunction and this "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemiconcern" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of 13 patients with a mirror <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the left hemisphere and none of 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemisensory loss due to thalamic capsular or brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> showed hemiconcern behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This behaviour may result from a feeling of strangeness critically associated with hemisensory loss without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751421" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">hemispatial neglect</z:e>, due to involvement of the right anterior parietotemporal region </plain></SENT>
