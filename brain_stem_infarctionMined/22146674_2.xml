<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Molecular hydrogen has prominent effects on more than 30 animal models especially of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-mediated diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, hydrogen effects on humans have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> type 2, hemodialysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, radiotherapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hydrogen effects are ascribed to specific radical-scavenging activities that eliminate <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, and also to signal-modulating activities, but the detailed molecular mechanisms still remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hydrogen is a safe molecule that is largely produced by intestinal bacteria in rodents and humans, and no adverse effects have been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed open-label trial of drinking 1.0 liter per day of hydrogen-enriched water for 12 weeks in five patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003560'>muscular dystrophy</z:hpo> (PMD), four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> (PM/DM), and five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003737'>mitochondrial myopathies</z:hpo> (MM), and measured 18 serum parameters as well as urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33023">8-isoprostane</z:chebi> every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We next conducted randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 0.5 liter per day of hydrogen-enriched water or placebo water for 8 weeks in 10 patients with DM and 12 patients with MM, and measured 18 serum parameters every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the open-label trial, no objective improvement or worsening of clinical symptoms was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We, however, observed significant effects in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratios in PMD and MM, fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in PMD, serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) in PM/DM, and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in PM/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the double-blind trial, no objective clinical effects were observed, but a significant improvement was detected in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi>-to-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratios in MM and MMP3 in DM also exhibited favorable responses but without statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No adverse effect was observed in either trial except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> in an insulin-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MELAS</z:e> patient, which subsided by reducing the insulin dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen-enriched water improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in MM and inflammatory processes in PM/DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Less prominent effects with the double-blind trial compared to the open-label trial were likely due to a lower amount of administered hydrogen and a shorter observation period, which implies a threshold effect or a dose-response effect of hydrogen </plain></SENT>
