<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some lesions may be missed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage due to technical limitation of DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore conducted the study to clarify the sensitivity of DWI to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients with the final diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>(midbrain 2, pons 9, medulla oblongata 17) who had been examined by DWI within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were retrospectively analyzed for how sensitively the initial DWI demonstrated the final ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only obvious(distinguishable with DWI alone without referring clinical symptoms and other informations) hyperintensity on DWI was regarded to show an ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen(57.1%) out of 28 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> demonstrated by initial DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 12 cases, no obvious ischemic lesion was evident on initial DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent MRI studies obtained 127 hours, on average after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed infarction in the medulla oblongata in 11 cases and in the pons in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Negative findings of DWI in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage does not exclude possibility of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, in particulary medulla oblongata infarction </plain></SENT>
