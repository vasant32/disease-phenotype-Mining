<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were contacted by mail in January and February, 1974; in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates were procured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period was from 4 to 99 months (median 46.5 months), during which a total of 39 patients had died </plain></SENT>
