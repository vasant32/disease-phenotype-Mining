<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study sought to report technical details and clinical results of the first series of endovascular recanalization for cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cervical ICA occlusion is associated with impaired cerebral perfusion, which may lead to ischemic cerebral symptoms and hemodynamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither surgical nor endovascular revascularization has been shown to benefit this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endovascular recanalization was attempted in 30 patients with ICA occlusions (27 men; age 72.1 +/- 8.0 years, range 48 to 85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrent neurologic deficit or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by perfusion study, after known ICA occlusion, was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strategies and devices for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> intervention were applied, including microcatheter-supported tapered-tip stiff coronary guidewires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contralateral ICA stenosis was found in 9 patients (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent independent neurologic and duplex ultrasound follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall technical success rate was 73% (22 of 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No neck <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, or hyperperfusion was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One (3.3%) fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> occurred 1 day after a successful ICA procedure, with angiographically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and patent ICA stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline ophthalmic artery flow was reversed in 15 of the 22 successfully recanalized patients, and was normalized in 12 after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no new cerebral ischemic event or neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for a mean follow-up of 16.1 +/- 18.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular recanalization for cervical ICA occlusion is feasible with acceptable midterm clinical results </plain></SENT>
