<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are broadly referred as cortical dysplastic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While these dysplastic conditions involving cerebral cortex present as drug resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder, those involving cerebellum present as mass lesions or slowly progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report 17 cases, representing the histological spectrum of dysplastic, glioneuronal migration disorders which include, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> (1), tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber Syndrome</z:e> with focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1266177" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="DNET">Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor</z:e> (7) and Lhermitte Ductos disease of cerebellum (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dysplastic neurons in varied stages of maturation showed neuronal cytoskeletal pathology similar to that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neuro degenerative diseases</z:hpo>, especially when associated with cytomegaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, cells exhibiting dual expression of glial and neuronal markers were noted in the cerebral dysplastic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dysplastic glial elements probably form the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009718'>subependymal giant cell astrocytomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic neuronal elements form the nidus for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="920">DNT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When localized, surgical resection ameliorate the symptoms in many of these condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Study of these conditions provide better insight into glioneuronal interaction and maturation of the brain </plain></SENT>
