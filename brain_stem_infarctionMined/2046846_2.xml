<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (FA) and dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) of the vertebro-basilar systems have been thought to be rare, but recently reports of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis between FA and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> is requisite for deciding therapy or for prognosis, but it is often difficult to distinguish these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> even if angiographies are conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors have treated 6 cases with FA and 5 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> during the past 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the initial symptom, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases with FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 2 cases of SAH, 2 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, and 1 case of ischemic attack were noted in <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aneurysmal locations of FA were at the vertebral artery (VA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases, and those of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> were at the VA in 3 cases and at the basilar artery (BA) in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As angiographic findings of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, pearl &amp; string signs were demonstrated in 3 cases, and retention of contrast medium was noted in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of FA is comparatively easy on angiography but when angiospasm exists, it is difficult to differentiate <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> from FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Consequently, repeated angiography is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings of 2 cases with FA were compared with those of 3 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No abnormal findings, excepting a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the signal-void area corresponding to the arterial blood flow were shown in FA, but various abnormalities were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 3 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Namely, an intimal flap and a double lumen in 1 case, intra-mural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in 1 case, and a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> adjacent to the parent artery in 2 cases were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was thought to be a useful means for distinguishing between FA and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
