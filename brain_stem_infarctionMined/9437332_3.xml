<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination combined with ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed in a patient with Sturge-Weber-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the patient's left eye, which had Sturge-Weber-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, a 360-degree supraciliary effusion, dilated superficial and intrascleral vessels, and an open angle were detected by ultrasound biomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of dilated intrascleral vessels and supraciliary fluid support the hypothesis of increased episcleral venous pressure as the cause of elevated intraocular pressure in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
