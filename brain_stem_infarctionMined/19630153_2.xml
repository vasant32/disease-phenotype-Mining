<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 56 patients with unilateral pontine base infarction who underwent (i) diffusion-weighted MRI within 48 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and (ii) follow-up MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologic progression was defined as increased National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score by &gt; or = 2 during admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was dichotomized as good and poor (&gt; or = 3) according to the modified Rankin Scale at 1 month after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (39%) had BAD and 15 patients (27%) had neurologic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRI performed at median 3.5 +/- 1.1 days after the initial MRI showed the lesion volume significantly increased (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BAD was not significantly related to demographic characteristics, risk factors, initial and follow-up lesion volume, neurologic progression and clinical outcome, but was closely related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> increase in lesion volume (P = 0.004 for 20% increase, P = 0.029 for 50% increase) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BAD is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> increase in lesion volume, but not to ultimate poor clinical outcome in patients with pontine base infarction </plain></SENT>
