<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the impact of contralateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome after hemispherectomy for refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 110 children, 0.4-18 (median 5.9) years of age, who underwent hemispherectomy for severe refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> at Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In children with contralateral (as well as ipsilateral) MRI findings appreciated preoperatively, the decision to proceed to surgery was based on other features concordant with the side with the most severe MRI abnormality, including ipsilateral epileptiform discharges, lateralizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> semiology, and side of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We retrospectively observed contralateral MRI abnormalities (predominantly small hemisphere, white matter loss or abnormal signal, or sulcation abnormalities) in 81 patients (74%), including 31 of 43 (72%) with malformations of cortical development (MCD), 31 of 42 (73%) with perinatal injury from infarction or <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and 15 of 25 (60%) with Rasmussen's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, or posttraumatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">encephalomalacia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 84 children (76%) with lesions that were congenital or acquired pre- or perinatally, 67 (83%) had contralateral MRI abnormalities (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contralateral findings were subjectively judged to be mild or moderate in 70 (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up 12-84 (median 24) months after surgery, 79% of patients with contralateral MRI abnormalities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free compared to 83% of patients without contralateral MRI findings, with no differences based on etiology group or type or severity of contralateral MRI abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: MRI abnormalities, usually mild to moderate in severity, were seen in the contralateral hemisphere in the majority of children who underwent hemispherectomy for refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> due to various etiologies, especially those that were congenital or early acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The contralateral MRI findings, always much less prominent than those in the ipsilateral hemisphere, did not correlate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome and may not contraindicate hemispherectomy in otherwise favorable candidates </plain></SENT>
