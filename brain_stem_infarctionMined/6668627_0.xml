<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progressive neurologic dysfunction preceded his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 143 hours after poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain stem infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> were noted at post mortem and closely resembled the brain stem pathology in 3 of 7 adults who died after diquat ingestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal, gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement in this child also resembled that seen in adults after ingestion of diquat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemoperfusion was performed six times in an effort to lower the body diquat burden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cellulose-coated, activated charcoal was first employed 40 hours postingestion and removed diquat from serum with clearances of 104 and 39 ml/minute at the initiation of hemoperfusion and 6 hours later, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum diquat concentrations decreased rapidly during charcoal hemoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, marked rebound in serum diquat concentrations were noted between charcoal treatments, indicating extensive sequestration of diquat by tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo>, the major complications of charcoal hemoperfusion, were easily treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike charcoal, Amberlite XAD-4 resin hemoperfusion did not remove diquat from serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Charcoal hemoperfusion may temporarily reduce serum diquat concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether the early institution and daily performance of charcoal hemoperfusion will minimize diquat-induced damage to brain and other organs is not clear from this case and will only be determined in future studies </plain></SENT>
