<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> in patients who attend Otolaryngology clinics are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral vestibular disorders</z:e> (PVD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> (VBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to see whether MRA findings can distinguish VBI from PVD to evaluate the efficiency of MRA in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 185 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> patients were examined by MRA with the 3D-Phase Contrast method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three kinds of abnormalities of vessels, that is, (a) disappearance, (b) meandering, and (c) stoppage were found in MRA imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we classified the MRA patterns into four types with two subtypes: type I; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, type II-R; right hypoform of the vertebral artery, II-L; left hypoform of the vertebral artery, III; meandering form of the vertebrobasilar artery, IV-1; stoppage form of the basilar artery, IV-2; hypoform of the bilateral vertebral and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the MRA patterns in each patient was camed out by a radiologist and neurosurgeon with the cooperation of an otolaryngologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 185 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> patients, 139 patients were clinically diagnosed as having PVD, 41 patients as having VBI, and 5 patients as having cerebellar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The numbers of patients in MRA patterns I, II-R, II-L, III and IV were 140, 17, 12, 8, and 8 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total number of VBI patients who demonstrated type III or IV patterns in MRA was significantly higher than that of type I, II-R and II-L (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 8 cases with cerebellar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> belonged to type IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in nine cases with type II-R, II-L, III or IV-1, and the number of patients in each group was 3, 3, 1 and 2 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the type II-R and II-L cases revealed hypoform of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The appearance of type III was restricted to type III's view was only meandering and type IV-1 showed severe stenotic changes in the union area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data show that MRA findings in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> patients are very effective in distinguishing VBI and cerebellar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> from PVD and that some pattern of MRA may correspond to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We think MRA examination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> patients is useful not only to assist in the diagnosis of the etiology but also to predict the stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in each patient </plain></SENT>
