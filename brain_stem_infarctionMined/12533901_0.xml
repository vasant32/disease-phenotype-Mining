<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Through the use of a high-speed spiral CT scanner (GEMedical HiSpeedZX/i), CT/P/A technique, where conventional CT, CT perfusion imaging (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) and CT angiography (CTA) are consecutively performed, can now be performed with an imaging time of 90 seconds and a total contrast medium volume of 100 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective clinical study was performed to ascertain the effectiveness of CT/P/A in diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 29 consecutive patients of Teraoka Memorial Hospital suspected of suffering from the occlusion or constriction of cerebral arteries and who underwent CT/P/A within 3 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> served as subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, or Odds ratio of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> and CTA in detecting lesions that caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> detected a hypoperfusion area with a sensitivity, specificity, and Odds ratio of 80%, 64%, and 7.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity in lobar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, white matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was 100%, 100%, 100%, 0% (p = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and Odds ratio of CT/P/A in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> differed according to the diameter of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>That with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 10 mm or more was 91%, 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> smaller than 10 mm was 50%, 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTA detected arterial lesions that caused cerebral ischemic attack with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The examination time for CT/P/A was 18 minutes, total radiation time being 90 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although CT/P/A was ineffective for the diagnosis of brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lesions smaller than 10 mm, CT/P/A was useful in detecting moderate-sized hypoperfusion areas and arterial lesions three-dimensionally before an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is completed </plain></SENT>
