<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) are caused by a short-latency reflex recorded from averaged electromyography from the sternocleidomastoid muscle evoked by intense auditory clicks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Besides peripheral vestibulopathy, abnormal VEMPs can be caused by lesions of the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the topology of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> generating pathological VEMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were prospectively studied using VEMPs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging to evaluate the brainstem representation of the VEMP reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Individual brainstem lesions were projected to a standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-dataset for normalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Probabilistic lesion maps were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A digital brainstem atlas was fitted to the lesion maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients showed unilaterally abnormal VEMPs, 10 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> VEMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with bilaterally absent VEMPs were not analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were located in the lateral medulla oblongata involving the spinal accessory nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most lesions in the pons were associated to anterolateral parts of pyramidal tract fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a few cases, lesions were located in the tegmental area of the pons, including the vestibular nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal VEMPs may be produced not only by peripheral vestibulopathy but also by brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>VEMPs may be influenced by effects caused by lesions located above the level of the vestibular nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This study adds to the knowledge of anatomical brainstem representation of VEMP </plain></SENT>
