<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively documented the clinical presentation, pathology, treatment, and outcome of patients age &lt; or = 21 years with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334630" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant vascular tumors</z:e> treated between 1970-1995 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histologic sections were rereviewed to confirm the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients were identified with <z:mp ids='MP_0003667'>angiosarcoma</z:mp> and two with malignant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_239'>hemangioendothelioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients were female and one was male; the median age at diagnosis was 11.8 years (range, 8 months-21 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> involved the skin in one patient, soft tissue in one patient, bone in two patients, and internal organs in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diffuse angiomatosis</z:e> and another had the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient received prior radiation therapy to the primary site with the subsequent development of a vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Resection was attempted in five patients and completed in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy alone was given to three patients whereas radiation therapy alone and radiation plus chemotherapy were administered to one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 4.9 years (range, 1 month-12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from progressive disease and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from locoregional recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reexcision and radiotherapy controlled one local recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Another patient developed recurrence to regional lymph nodes and further dissemination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three survivors was excised completely whereas two of the three patients who died of progressive disease underwent an incomplete excision or biopsy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1334630" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Malignant vascular tumors</z:e> are rare in the first two decades of life and when they do occur are very aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Complete resection is curative for patients with localized lesions </plain></SENT>
