<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> involving a unilateral side of the midbrain tegmentum showed a peculiar ocular symptom complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ocular syndrome consisted of (1) oculomotor palsy ipsilateral to the lesion, (2) monocular <z:mp ids='MP_0006166'>eyelid retraction</z:mp> and upward <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e> contralateral to the lesion, and (3) conjugate downward gaze and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339656" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">convergence palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By computed tomography and cerebral angiography, the lesion shared by the two cases was identified in the territory of median mesencephalic rami originating from the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion involved oculomotor nucleus on a side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contralateral monocular symptoms and conjugate palsies could be attributed to a damage in their supranuclear tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering with two similar cases in the literature, it is strongly suggested that a unilateral ischemic lesion of the paramedian dorsal part of the midbrain tegmentum is responsible for this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral or unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0006166'>eyelid retraction</z:mp> (Collier's sign) was considered to locate a lesion in the posterior commisure by Collier himself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The posterior commisure is, however, not involved in our two cases, and a paramedian lesion of the midbrain tegmentum deviated to a side may cause contralateral <z:mp ids='MP_0006166'>eyelid retraction</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the lesion, upward or lateral (in the opposite direction to the lesion) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e>, and hemiataxia on the contralateral side resembling our second case is sometimes erroneously called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270756" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Nothnagel's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nothnagel mentioned symptomatology of the quadrigeminal bodies for local diagnosis in his text in which he did not describe this combination of signs </plain></SENT>
