<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differences concern certain flattening of papillary ridges and reduced parameters of the total ridge count in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only in two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004099'>macrodactyly</z:hpo> an increase in the relative length of fingers was accompanied by an increase in number of epidermal ridges and in the distance between fingers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0004099'>macrodactyly</z:hpo> is based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> or recombinations, then, depending on the time when the resulting mutant cell clones appear (before or after the epidermal ridges are laid down), the <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of finger rudiments will or will not affect the value of ridge count </plain></SENT>
