<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to describe current practices and results of the use of alteplase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children enrolled in an international pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry and to compare current practices with those published in case reports and with guidelines for the use of alteplase for adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this multicentre observational cohort study, we analysed the clinical features, the dosing and timing of treatment, and the short-term outcome in children treated with alteplase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were enrolled in the International Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (IPSS) between January, 2003, and July, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings from the IPSS were compared with published case reports for clinical features, adherence to adult guidelines for alteplase, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Of 687 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> enrolled in the IPSS, 15 (2%) received alteplase: nine received intravenous alteplase and six received intra-arterial alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to treatment from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 3.3 h (range 2.0-52.0 h) for intravenous alteplase and 4.5 h (3.8-24.0 h) for intra-arterial alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died (one owing to massive infarction and brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, and one owing to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At discharge from hospital, one patient was healthy and 12 patients had neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial haemorrhage after alteplase occurred in four of 15 patients, although none of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> events was judged to be acutely symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When compared with ten patients reported in published articles who were given intravenous alteplase, the nine patients in the IPSS cohort were mostly younger, waited longer for treatment, and had worse outcomes, which suggests there is a publication bias towards short treatment intervals from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and favourable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> received alteplase infrequently and at time intervals that often deviated from adult guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although no alteplase-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was reported, poor neurological outcome was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials to evaluate the dose and the safety and efficacy of alteplase are needed in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
