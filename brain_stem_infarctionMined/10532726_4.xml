<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 16 eyes of 14 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> diagnosed before 4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were seen at a single institution from 1978 to 1996 and underwent goniotomy or trabeculotomy as their initial surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve eyes underwent initial goniotomy, and 4 eyes underwent initial trabeculotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One subject was lost to follow-up after surgery, resulting in 15 eyes for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the initial goniotomy eyes, two thirds required a second surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the initial trabeculotomy eyes, half required a second procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure was controlled (intraocular pressure &lt; or = 22 mm Hg) in 66.7% of the eyes (10 of 15) after one or more goniotomy or trabeculotomy procedures for a median follow-up of 5.4 years (range, 1.4 to 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For eyes with only one surgical procedure, 4 of 6 eyes had controlled intraocular pressure over a median follow-up of 3.4 years (range, 3 to 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 9 eyes that required more than one procedure had controlled intraocular pressure after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures over a median follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 1.4 to 15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Initial or repeated goniotomy or trabeculotomy may be an effective management choice for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> presenting in early childhood </plain></SENT>
