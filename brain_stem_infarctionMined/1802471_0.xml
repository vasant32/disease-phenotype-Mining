<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a 47-year-old man with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had several episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> during his thirties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in his right lower leg at the age of 35, when laboratory studies demonstrated prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and a biological false-positive result occurred on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">syphilis</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> in the right eye suddenly appeared at the age of 42, he was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the age of 47, he developed constructional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002442'>dyscalculia</z:hpo>, skilled movement disturbances and generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>Subdural hematoma</z:hpo> and multiple lacunes in the cerebral white matter were demonstrated with brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patient was positive for Rumpel-Leede phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory studies revealed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>prolonged bleeding time</z:hpo> and APTT, positive antinuclear antibody and positive test results for both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and an anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibody, namely anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we consider that the tendency of this patient to bleed may have been due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, attacking the platelet membranes and that the bridging veins in the subdural space may be the site at which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> easily appears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome accompanied by hemorrhagic complications had rarely been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that special attention should be given to hemorrhagic complications in patients with anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> antibody syndrome associated with fragility of the vessels and/or platelet dysfunction </plain></SENT>
