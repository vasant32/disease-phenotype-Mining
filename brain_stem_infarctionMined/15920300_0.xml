<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> resulted from a brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN: Before-after, single-subject experimental design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTION: Four-week course of postural training, comprised of three one-hour sessions/week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The patient demonstrated an increase in function of the ataxic limb, as evidenced by appreciable increases in the Fugl-Meyer score and modest increases in the Postural Assessment Scale for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Patients (PASS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in postural control influences upper extremity function affecting the speed and accuracy of the movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the effectiveness of using postural training as an intervention towards reducing the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, a movement coordination impairment for which relatively few therapeutic techniques have been specifically developed or evaluated </plain></SENT>
