<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, no studies have addressed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging changes that may also accompany this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings in children with hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> caused by near drowning and to compare these findings with the results of qualitative and quantitative proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two children (6 months to 11 years old) admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit after near drowning incidents underwent cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and quantitative proton <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging studies were reviewed retrospectively, and subjects were grouped according to outcome: good result, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Images were scored for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, basal ganglia changes, and cortical changes, and were compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectra and outcome at days 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients had a good outcome, four remained in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242670" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent vegetative state</z:e>, and 12 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Generalized/occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> correlated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indistinct lentiform nuclei margins on T1-weighted images were a frequent finding (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basal ganglia T2 hyperintensity correlated with poor outcome, progressing from a patchy/peripheral distribution to diffuse high intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patchy high T2 signal in the cortex or subcortical lines were specific but insensitive for poor outcome, as were brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in children with hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> after near drowning show a spectrum of changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most sensitive prognostic result may be achieved by combining <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with qualitative and quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopic data </plain></SENT>
