<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we studied 21 cases of clinically definite brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and conventional computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI demonstrated brainstem lesions in 79% of the cases (16.5 out of 21), while CT revealed 33% (7 out of 21) when cases with suspicious lesions counted as 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although MRI was done a few days later than CT in most cases, MRI was superior to CT in detecting the number and the size of ischemic lesions, with clear delineation of <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and visualization of the status of the blood flow in the vertebral-basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disappearance of the flow signal void in the basilar artery can be an important clue in diagnosing occlusion or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By delineating the extent and the location of the infarction, MRI findings allowed an interpretation of whether the ischemic vessel is a small basilar branch or a large vessel vertebral or basilar artery </plain></SENT>
