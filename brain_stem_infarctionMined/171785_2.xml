<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The microfistulas formed part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e> (K-T) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The management of one case is reported in detail and in three others salient features are touched upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Careful clinical and radiological examination failed to demonstrate any arteriovenous microfistulas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When Doppler ultrasound scanning was carried out, two discrete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their extent and direction were mapped out accurately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incisions were made directly over the markings displaying a pulsating capillary tuft of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further dissection exposed a feeding arteriole which was less than 1 mm. in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excision of the vascular malformations resulted in the cure of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In another patient with the K-T syndrome in whom a cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> involved the whole lower limb, in spite of a thorough and systematic search with a Doppler, no microfistulas could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients suffering from the K-T syndrome should be examined by Doppler ultrasound in the hope that microfistulas which elude radiodiagnostic techniques might be detected and treated surgically </plain></SENT>
