<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the efficacy and safety of anti-TNF-alpha therapy for intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In nine patients with systemic erythematosus who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> resistant to steroids and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi>, 200 mg/body of infliximab was drip-infused three times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No changes were made to other treatments for three months after the start of anti-TNF-alpha therapy, and urinary findings, renal function, serum complement, anti-DNA antibody, SLE activity, and adverse events were examined for six months after the start of anti-TNF-alpha therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One of the nine patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0011403'>pyelonephritis</z:mp> after the first infliximab injection and received no further injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining eight patients received 3 infliximab injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients, urinary protein decreased after anti-TNF-alpha therapy in six patients, and the SLEDAI improved in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary findings and/or SLE activity improved in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients whose urinary protein levels decreased after anti-TNF-alpha therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> recurred six months after anti-TNF-alpha therapy in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After anti-TNF-alpha therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> and the SLEDAI improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With respect to adverse events, therapy was discontinued in one patient who developed <z:mp ids='MP_0011403'>pyelonephritis</z:mp>, and one patient developed decreased blood pressure due to infusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient in whom the steroid dosage was increased due to poor response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> occurred four months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient, anti-DNA antibody levels increased after therapy, but none of the patients had decreased serum complement levels or increased SLE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo>, anti-TNF-alpha therapy improved urinary protein levels and SLE activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although adverse events must be monitored cautiously, it may be possible to use anti-TNF-alpha therapy as a third-line treatment </plain></SENT>
