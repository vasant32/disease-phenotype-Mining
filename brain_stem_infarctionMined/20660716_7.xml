<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sniffing is a precise sensory-motor acquisition entailing changes in nasal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The fine control of sniffing depends on positioning the soft palate, which is innervated by multiple cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This innervation pattern led us to hypothesize that sniffing may remain conserved following severe injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To test this, we developed a device that measures nasal pressure and converts it into electrical signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The device enabled sniffs to control an actuator with speed similar to that of a hand using a mouse or joystick </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging of device usage revealed a widely distributed neural network, allowing for increased conservation following injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also, device usage shared neural substrates with language production, rendering sniffs a promising bypass mode of communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, sniffing allowed completely paralyzed locked-in participants to write text and quadriplegic participants to write text and drive an electric wheelchair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that redirection of sniff motor programs toward alternative functions allows sniffing to provide a control interface that is fast, accurate, robust, and highly conserved following severe injury </plain></SENT>
