<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The functional hemispherectomy procedure consists of disconnecting the hemispheres while attempting, in some cases, to preserve parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study retrospectively reviews the histopathologic findings in 37 cases of functional hemispherectomy performed between 1990 and 1998 at a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014549" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">major epilepsy</z:e> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed in 20 males and 17 females who ranged in age from 3 months to 37 years (mean age, 9.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases, more than half or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the material submitted for pathologic testing was examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>Cortical dysplasias</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> were identified in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common patterns of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> observed included architectural disorganization (n = 13), increased molecular layer neurons (n = 11), and neuronal cytomegaly (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was known to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0010816'>epidermal nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>/ischemic damage was identified as the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in six patients; four of these patients had mild associated secondary cortical architectural abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients demonstrated pathology consistent with Rasmussen's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>; one additional patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> changes, not otherwise specified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In two cases, changes consistent with hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> were identified; additionally, hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> was focally identified in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients had coexistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> or radiographic evidence of remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One specimen demonstrated areas of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> following resection of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In two specimens, significant histopathologic findings were not identified; both of these patients had radiographic evidence of remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of pathologic conditions that may be encountered in the setting of a functional hemispherectomy is varied and in this study most frequently included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> remote <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and Rasmussen's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
