<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of the right side evoked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> latency P9, P11 and P13 potentials at scalp as well as at nasopharyngeal (NP) leads, while P14 and N18 potentials were absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These SEP abnormalities, that have been described previously in cervico-medullary lesions and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patients with upper brain-stem involvement, suggest that in our patient the removal of the left thalamus has caused retrograde degeneration of the cuneate-thalamic projections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this study confirms that P13 and P14 potentials have different generators </plain></SENT>
