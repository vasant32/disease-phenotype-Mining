<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The mechanisms of epileptogenesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored the properties of neurons from human pediatric SWS cortex in vitro and tested in particular whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>) excites neurons in SWS cortex, as has been suggested for various types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patch-clamp and field potential recordings and dynamic biphoton imaging were used to analyze cortical tissue samples obtained from four 6- to 14-month-old pediatric SWS patients during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurons in SWS cortex were characterized by a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential, as was estimated from cell-attached recordings of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many cells spontaneously fired action potentials at a rate proportional to the level of neuronal depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reversal potential for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>-activated currents, assessed by cell-attached single channel recordings, was close to the resting membrane potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> spontaneously firing neurons recorded in cell-attached mode or imaged with biphoton microscopy were inhibited by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous epileptiform activity in the form of recurrent population bursts was suppressed by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> isoguvacine, and the positive allosteric <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) modulator <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blockade of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors aggravated spontaneous epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The NKCC1 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> bumetanide had little effect on epileptiform activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: SWS cortical neurons have a relatively depolarized resting membrane potential and spontaneously fire action potentials that may contribute to increased network excitability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous data depicting excitatory and proconvulsive actions of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> in certain pediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsies</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> plays mainly an inhibitory and anticonvulsive role in SWS pediatric cortex </plain></SENT>
