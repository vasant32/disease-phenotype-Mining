<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to review 27 cases of extensive limb VMs and describe their characteristics and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases of extensive limb VMs were investigated, treated, and observed for a mean of 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven cases involved the upper limbs and 16 involved the lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> involved skin and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 81% of cases in the lower limb there was also knee joint involvement that created severe functional impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography with Doppler (duplex scans), computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance imaging were helpful noninvasive diagnostic procedures in these patients, whereas arteriography and phlebography were less informative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Muscle involvement was present in 100% of patients and bone abnormalities in 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Leg length was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or there was slight limb undergrowth, except in three patients who had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the affected limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coagulation profiles demonstrated localized intravascular coagulation in 88% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had conservative management (elastic stockings) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a few, percutaneous sclerotherapy or partial excision of skin and muscle VMs was beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Knee joint involvement required synovectomy and VM excision during childhood in 7 of 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Extensive limb VMs are characterized by diffuse involvement of the skin, muscle, and joints, and by a specific localized intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> with general consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This group of vascular malformations should be separated from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes Weber syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
