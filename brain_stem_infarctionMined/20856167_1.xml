<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated if cognitive and fine motor abnormalities are associated with impaired microstructural integrity in specific WM regions in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen children with unilateral SWS (age: 3-12.4 y) and 11 controls (age: 6-12.8 y) underwent diffusion tensor imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tract-based spatial statistics was used for objective comparisons of WM fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the SWS group, WM FA and MD values were correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) and fine motor scores, with age as a co-variate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral, multilobar WM areas showed decreased FA, whereas significant MD increases were confined to small ipsilateral posterior regions in SWS children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IQ in the SWS group (range: 47-128) was positively correlated with FA in the ipsilateral prefrontal WM and inversely associated with MD in the ipsilateral posterior parietal WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A negative correlation between fine motor function and MD was found in ipsilateral frontal WM encompassing motor pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microstructural WM abnormalities occur not only ipsilateral but also contralateral to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, cognitive and fine motor functions are related to diffusion abnormalities in specific ipsilateral, mostly frontal, WM regions </plain></SENT>
