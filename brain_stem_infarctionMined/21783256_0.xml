<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To identify the sensitivity and specificity of risk factors for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port wine stain</z:hpo> (PWS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study involving a large cohort of patients with PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: A total of 216 patients (total of 252 eyes) with unilateral or bilateral PWS seen in the eye department in Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the anatomic distribution of PWS and the incidence of choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, episcleral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, iris heterochromia, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of these features as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 2.9 years (3 weeks to 18.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 3.2 years (0-15 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 180 patients (83.3%) had unilateral lesion, and 36 patients (16.7%) had bilateral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients (14.3%) had isolated V1 lesion, 35 patients had V2 lesion only (16.2%), and 93 patients (43%) had both V1 and V2 involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the last visit, 46 eyes (18.3%) in 39 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>; their mean age was 3.25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was more common if PWS was bilateral (P=0.0001), both upper and lower lids were involved (P &lt; 0.0001), and episcleral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001), iris heterochromia (P=0.004), or choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.0001) was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients had SWS; this was significantly associated with upper lid PWS (P=0.001) and bilateral PWS (P=0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was more common in patients with SWS compared with those without (66.7% vs. 18%, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Combined upper and lower lid PWS, episcleral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, SWS, and iris heterochromia are sensitive prognosticators for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Iris heterochromia is associated with the development of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in patients with PWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> should be seen more often in clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients who do not have combined lid involvement or episcleral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> have a lower risk and can therefore be seen less often in clinic </plain></SENT>
