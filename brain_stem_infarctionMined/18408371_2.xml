<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 685 consecutive cases of vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> diagnosed by brain MRI from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven consecutive patients (1.0%) were identified as having SD as a symptom of non-AICA territory vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Audiological testing confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, predominantly cochlear in 4 patients and combined on the affected side cochlear and retrocochlear in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients had an isolated cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of the medial branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and other 2 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, SD was on the side of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, as shown on brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had accompanied canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> to caloric stimulation on the side of SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SD due to non-AICA territory infarction was mostly associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From the known variation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the internal auditory artery and results of audiovestibular evaluations, SD due to non-AICA territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> probably results from the damage to the inner ear </plain></SENT>
