<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The literature suggests that the deep venous system is often under-developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose that duplex venous ultrasound can effectively demonstrate patent deep venous systems in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients with mild to moderate disease, and that endovascular radiofrequency ablation can be utilized in a safe and appropriate therapeutic manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A single center retrospective review of three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> treated with endovascular radiofrequency ablation of the KT veins and/or great saphenous veins was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, patients underwent both venography and were studied with color flow duplex ultrasound system iU22 with a 7-5 MHz linear array probe (Philips Medical Systems, NA, Bothell, Wash) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anomalous KT veins, great saphenous and saphenous tributaries, and associated incompetent perforators were ablated with radiofrequency catheters (VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc, San Jose, Calif) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the radiofrequency ablations were complimented by ultrasound guided sclerotherapy of the varicose tributaries and when evident, incompetent perforator veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnostic series of duplex ultrasounds performed on our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients has demonstrated contiguous deep venous systems in the effected extremity and effectively recognized the associated anomalous superficial venous systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our treatment resulted in successful occlusion of the incompetent veins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The three patients, females aged 39, 19, and 16, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port wine stains</z:hpo> and many years of leg-swelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> that were recalcitrant to conservative treatment measures, including compression stockings and pulsed-dye laser therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Venography initially revealed poorly developed deep venous systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, venous ultrasound demonstrated patent and competent deep venous systems in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the affected limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Radiofrequency ablations were performed to manage the sequella of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At short-term follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients demonstrated markedly decreased leg pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicose vein</z:e> bulging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the incompetent great saphenous and/or anomalous superficial veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the deep veins were poorly visualized on venography, they were clearly demonstrated with duplex ultrasound and functioned adequately once the incompetent superficial veins were ablated </plain></SENT>
