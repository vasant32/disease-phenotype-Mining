<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiographic findings in 23 patients, and the clinical features of rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and maximal deficit occurring at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, were consistent with embolism of the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>Visual field defects</z:hpo> were the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> in 17 patients; the remainder had additional findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a major brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> in the posterior cerebral artery territory was found in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of patients, although embolism was the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several distinct patient groups were identified: cardiac source embolism (10 patients), vertebrobasilar atheroma with local embolism (6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> (5), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> with presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> (3), and "unknown source embolism" after negative cardiac investigation (11 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 26 patients had no further neurological events (the majority on anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment), 3 suffered new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and 6 died </plain></SENT>
