<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed only unilateral involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration (mmol/kg wet weight) of the neuronal marker N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> was significantly reduced by 37% in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhanced volume of interest compared to a similarly placed contralateral volume of interest (5.39 +/- 1.70 [SD] vs 8.50 +/- 1.14, P &lt; .005, two-tailed paired Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decreased N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral volume of interest was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi>/phosphocreatine or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> compounds between the ipsilateral and contralateral volumes of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings give possible new insight into the pathophysiology of this disease and suggest that quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be useful for the early characterization and monitoring of neuronal dysfunction or loss in infants and children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
