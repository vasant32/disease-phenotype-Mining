<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is essential to understand the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to ensure rational <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> therapy and secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to know the distribution of pathogenesis in patients of a city hospital and the differences in risk factors, neurologic deficits, disability, and delay in clinical admittance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a period of one year, 222 patients (mean age 76.6 years; 59% women) with complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were admitted and underwent complete clinical and diagnostic procedures: CCT/MRI; Doppler- and color-coded duplex and transcranial sonography; echocardiography; use of the NINCDS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale and the Oxford disability scale; study of risk factors, and exploration of delay in admittance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following percentages of etiologies were evident: 31% cardiogenic embolism (60% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>), 13% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e>, 9% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">macroangiopathy</z:e>, 11% cerebellar or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, 18% more than one cause and 18% no cause found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with cardiogenic embolism showed significantly the highest scores on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale and the disability scale and had the shortest delay in admittance (57% were admitted within 3 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a city hospital, cardiogenic embolism is the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients suffer significantly the most severe neurologic deficits, dependence, and requirement of daily nursing care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients have the shortest delay in clinical admittance and the best chance of benefitting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> therapy and early secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
