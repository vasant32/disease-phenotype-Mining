<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common indications for this procedure are central <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>alveolar hypoventilation</z:hpo> and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper reviews the available data on the 19 patients treated with phrenic nerve stimulation in Australia to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients, 14 required pacing due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo>, one had congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0007110'>central hypoventilation</z:hpo> syndrome and one had brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information was unavailable for the remaining three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Currently, 11 of the pacers are known to be actively implanted, with the total pacing duration ranging from 1 to 21 years (mean 13 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 19 patients had revision surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of these were to replace the original I-107 system (which had a 3-5-year life expectancy) with the current I-110 system, which is expected to perform electrically for the patient's lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had revisions due to mechanical failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients' notes were incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that phrenic nerve stimulation can be used instead of mechanical ventilators for long-term ongoing respiratory support </plain></SENT>
