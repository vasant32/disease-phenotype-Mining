<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several approaches to the treatment of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system have been used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated our endovascular experience, which includes trapping and proximal occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five patients with intradural vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presented to our institution between 1992 and 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six were treated by endovascular means and two with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the endovascular group, 14 were in a supra-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) location, and three of these extended to the vertebrobasilar junction on the initial angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten were located in an infra-PICA location, or no antegrade flow was seen in the PICA or anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two were located at the PICA with antegrade flow preserved in the branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twelve lesions were treated with trapping; another 14 were initially treated with proximal occlusion techniques, two of which eventually required trapping procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up images were obtained within 1 year of initial treatment in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up for these patients was 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial treatments were technically successful and without complication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations showed complete cure in 19 of 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient died of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after presenting as Hunt and Hess grade 5 with subarachanoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred in patients in the proximal occlusion group; one died, and the other underwent a trapping procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient developed contralateral vertebral dissection 24 hours after occlusion of a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the dominant vertebral artery and died of a brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Another died of probable vasospasm, and the last died of an unknown cause 1 month after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients had recanalization despite an initial trapping procedure, both underwent further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 20% in the treated group (including the two patients treated surgically), with four of five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurring during the initial hospital course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Mortality rate was 50% in the six patients in the untreated group who were available for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system remain high-risk lesions because of their natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>They can be managed by endovascular methods according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, configuration, collateral circulation, and time of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Trapping results in better prevention of rehemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Proximal occlusion can achieve occlusion without manipulation of the affected segment when more direct endovascular occlusion or stent placement cannot be performed </plain></SENT>
