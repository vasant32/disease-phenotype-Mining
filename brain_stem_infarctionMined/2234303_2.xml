<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were classified into 3 types according to their clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 1 (18 cases); The course was benign, and symptoms and signs improved without surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 (11 cases); The course was progressive with deterioration of consciousness between 24-72 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 3 (4 cases); The course was rapid resulting in lapse into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> within a few hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, its prognosis was fatal due to coexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem infarction</z:e> regardless of any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention was required for Type 2 in which the lesion included the region of the vermis or occupied more than one-third of the cerebellar hemisphere, and had subsequently compressed the brain-stem and caused obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases out of Type 2, ventricular drainage alone was performed and prompt improvement of consciousness level was detected except in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider that ventricular drainage is not so invasive a method, and it is beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in 2 cases of Type 1 and 4 cases of Type 2, hemorrhagic infarction occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, one should be aware of the possibility of hemorrhagic infarction, even though it may be asymptomatic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If prompt improvement of consciousness is not detected after ventricular drainage, suboccipital craniectomy should be recommended </plain></SENT>
