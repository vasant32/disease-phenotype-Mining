<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 15 patients were operated on between 1993 and 2002 (11 cases of facial nerve injury during <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>vestibular schwannoma</z:hpo> surgery, and 4 cases of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Were assessed at a minimum of 18 months postop tonus and facial voluntary movements recovery (modified House Brackmann (HB) grading), lingual mobility (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>amyotrophy</z:hpo> and self-evaluation questionnaire), and patients' overall satisfaction (questionnaire) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean delay to evaluation was 57.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The tonus recovery appeared within 6 to 8 months (mean 28.5 weeks, SD 4.6 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tonus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The facial function was evaluated HB grade III in II cases (73.3%), grade IV in 3 cases (20%) and grade V in one (6.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eye occlusion was obtained within 13.6 months on average (SD 2.6 months) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The blepharorraphy was maintained in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278151" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">facial spasm</z:e> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The lingual motricity troubles were absent in 93.3% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients were satisfied in 93.3% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The less satisfactory results were observed when patients were managed late (&gt;2 years after nerve section) and in case of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This technique seems to be very efficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It presents the advantage to preserve lingual motricity and to decrease postoperative problems of midface <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
