<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described a 61-year-old man who was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cryptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, while he was hospitalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Claude syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had a tendency to fall down to his left side since he awoke in the morning of August 12, 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission, he was mentally alert, showing a right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oculomotor nerve palsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007979'>gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus</z:hpo> in the left eye on the left lateral gaze, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> of the left upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, he fell to the left side on standing up with feet together and with eyes closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had mild wild-based gait with a tendency to fall down to the left on tandem gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo> was present on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, nor meningeal signs, nor sensory abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>X-ray films of the chest showed multiple nodular shadows consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pneumoconiosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cranial X-ray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small lesion in the paramedian area of the midbrain on the right, consistent with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteriography revealed a stenosis in the proximal portion of the right posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a moderate mononuclear cell predominant pleocytosis, a moderate elevation of total protein, slightly reduced <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the culture and India ink preparation of CSF were negative for cryptococcus in repeated studies, its antigen was positive both in the serum and CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the CSF showed an oligoclonal IgG band which was predominantly K type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After the antigen of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010414" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cryptococcus neoformans</z:e> was added to the CSF in vitro, the oligoclonal IgG band was absorbed completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi> (FLCZ), which did not cause any improvement of the CSF abnormalities, so that FLCZ was replaced by 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="5100">flucytosine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Since the CSF abnormalities moderately improved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi>, he was discharged on December 21, 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>After the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi> was discontinued, the CSF results slowly worsened over several months without any signs and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>He was hospitalized again on October 28, 1996 for treatment with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although the CSF abnormalities improved markedly, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> was not cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>After he was discharged on February 1, 1997, he was treated with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-FC</z:chebi> and FLCZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although his CSF abnormalities worsened mildly, he remained afebrile without meningeal signs and symptoms and led an ordinary life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In our patient it remained undetermined whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Claude syndrome</z:e> was caused by arteriosclerotic infarction, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> due to cryptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cryptococcal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> as observed in our patients is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition, this is the second case after Porter et al (1977) that the oligoclonal IgG band in CSF proved to be related to cryptococcal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
