<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review is presented of the complications of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records from 75 consecutive operations requiring intraoperative lumbar cerebrospinal drainage during a 1-year period at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were reviewed to assess the types of complications attributable to spinal drainage and their rates of occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operations were categorized into 46 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clippings, 21 craniotomies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 8 other cranial base procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients developed transient postoperative neurological complications as a result of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> that resolved after epidural blood patching, with a reexploration craniotomy to drain an epidural collection performed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third patient in the study developed a persistent deficit when intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> led to intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e>, which resulted in an unusual constellation of multiple brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Complications of intraoperative lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage resulting in transient (2 of 75 patients, 3%) or persistent (1 of 75 patients, 1%) neurological deficits caused by intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> occur infrequently and may be related to preexisting conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
