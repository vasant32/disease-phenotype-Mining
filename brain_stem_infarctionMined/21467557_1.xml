<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Areas such as the trunk, bowel, bladder, and spinal cord may be involved as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> should not be confused with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004602'>Klippel-Feil syndrome</z:hpo>, which involves <z:hpo ids='HP_0003319'>abnormalities of the cervical vertebrae</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">Anesthetic</z:chebi> management for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> has only been described in limited case reports that caution about potential airway difficulty but do not report surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> requiring transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed an electronic search of the Mayo Clinic medical record database to identify patients who had undergone an <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> for surgery related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Review of medical records was performed for type of surgery, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> technique, airway management and difficulty, medications used, intraoperative fluid administration, transfusion requirements, vascular access used, and postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-two unique patients were identified who underwent 134 general <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> and 2 lumbar neuraxial <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> for surgeries related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 27% of patients had a history of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, 24% recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, 9% <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, and 2% <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at time of surgery was 21 ± 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of surgical procedures involved laser coagulation or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicose vein</z:e> sclerotherapy or stripping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 74 direct laryngoscopies and tracheal intubations were performed on the first attempt without difficulty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mask ventilation was possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 131 patients for whom this was attempted, with only 1 requiring an oral airway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Documented estimated blood loss ranged from 20 to 18,000 mL, with a mean of 740 ± 2739 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Use of a tourniquet did not obviate the possibility of substantial blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The only significant postoperative complication involved a calf <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> after vein stripping and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_625'>avulsion</z:mpath> that required return to the operating room for evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> have multiple associated comorbidities relevant to perioperative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports, difficulty with airway management was not encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Surgery related to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> may be associated with massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> despite tourniquet use, and the anesthesiologist should anticipate the need for appropriate fluid resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Neuraxial techniques may be considered only if the possibility of trauma to neurovascular malformations has been excluded with recent spine imaging </plain></SENT>
