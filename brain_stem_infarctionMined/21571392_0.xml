<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS)</z:e> is characterized by vascular malformations and disturbed soft tissue or bony growth, involving one or more extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high incidence of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE) has been reported in this disorder, along with cases of belated diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> thromboembolic (CTE) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002092'>pulmonary hypertension</z:hpo> (CTEPH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the prevalence of CTE in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Those from our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patient cohort willing to participate were examined with a sequential diagnostic workup including perfusion scintigraphy, computed tomography, and echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 68 patients, 48 patients participated in the study (median age 43 years; 29 [60%] were female) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (23%) had an abnormal perfusion scan result, of whom computed tomographic scanning showed signs of CTE in two patients (4.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2%-14%); both patients had a history of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography showed no signs of CTEPH in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In total, 23 patients (48%; 95% CI 35%-62%) had a history of superficial vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 8 patients (17%; 95% CI 8.7%-30%) had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, which was associated with more <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Echocardiography was only performed in patients with CTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> had a history of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CTE in the total <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> cohort, however, appeared less alarming than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we suggest that there is only a limited indication for CTEPH screening among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, awareness for CTEPH remains appropriate, especially among patients presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> and a history of VTE </plain></SENT>
