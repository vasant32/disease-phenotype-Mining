<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But the number of cases with RASA1 mutations reported to date is relatively small and the spectrum of phenotypes caused by mutations in this gene is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutation results and clinical findings in thirty-five unrelated consecutive cases sent for RASA1 molecular sequencing testing at ARUP Laboratories within the last two years were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight individuals had a pathogenic RASA1 mutation of which six were novel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These eight individuals <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had CMs (seven had multifocal CMs; one had multiple CMs), and six also had a brain or facial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two individuals with multifocal CMs including one with a fast flow lesion had a variant of uncertain significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other individuals, including sixteen with CMs and one with a vein of Galen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, tested negative for a RASA1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that multifocal CM is the key clinical finding to suggest a RASA1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnostic mutation detection rate among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples sent for RASA1 testing was 29% (10/35) which increases to approximately 39% (10/26) if patients without CMs are excluded </plain></SENT>
