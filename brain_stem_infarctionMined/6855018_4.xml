<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three types of blink reflex were evoked by 1) supraorbital nerve stimulation, 2) light flash stimulation and 3) corneal touch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blink reflex response was recorded simultaneously for both eyes by electromyography of the orbicularis oculi muscles of the lower eyelid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After supraorbital nerve stimulation, ipsilateral early response (R1) and bilateral late responses (R2) were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The light flash stimulation evoked the photic early and late responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latency times of the R1, R2 and the photic early responses were determined in 22 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The corneal touch was exactly timed using a new device and the latency time of the corneal blink reflex was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latency of the ipsilateral corneal blink reflex was significantly shorter than that of the contralateral reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The blink reflexes by supraorbital nerve stimulation and light flash were studied concurrently in 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> of vascular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The photic reflex was disturbed by bilateral occipital lobe lesions and also by affection of the rostral midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reflexes were not affected by lesions in the medial longitudinal fasciculus but were disturbed by widespread brainstem lesions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Foville syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical significance of a combined use of the supraorbital nerve and light flash stimulation was emphasized </plain></SENT>
