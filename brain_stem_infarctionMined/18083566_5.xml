<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The topodiagnostic implications of hemiataxia following lesions of the human brainstem are only incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a voxel-based statistical analysis of lesions documented on standardised MRI in 49 prospectively recruited patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hemiataxia due to isolated unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For statistical analysis individual MRI lesions were normalised and imported in a three-dimensional voxel-based anatomical model of the human brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis revealed hemiataxia to be associated with lesions of three distinct brainstem areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The strongest correlation referred to ipsilateral rostral and dorsolateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting the inferior cerebellar peduncle, and the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly, lesions of the ventral pontine base resulted in contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002070'>limb ataxia</z:hpo>, especially when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> was accompanied by motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with bilateral hemiataxia, lesions were located in a paramedian region between the upper pons and lower midbrain, involving the decussation of dentato-rubro-thalamic tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> may reflect three different pathophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(1) Ipsilateral hemiataxia following dorsolateral medullary infarctions results from a lesion of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract and the inferior cerebellar peduncle conveying afferent information from the ipsilateral arm and leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) Pontine lesions cause contralateral and not bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> presumably due to major damage to the descending corticopontine projections and pontine base nuclei, while already crossed pontocerebellar fibres are not completely interrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(3) Finally, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> probably reflects a lesion of cerebellar outflow on a central, rostral pontomesencephalic level </plain></SENT>
