<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From June 1995 to May 1997, 180 patients were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-seven patients were vertiginous patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the displacement angle of the basilar artery with MRA, and examined the relationship between the findings from some neurological examinations and MRA findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and forty-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> or dizziness were examined by MRI and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were diagnosed with MRI images in addition to several neurological examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA was not used for the diagnosis but rather for measuring the displacement angle of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six cases with central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vestibular disorders</z:e>, 11 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e>, and 26 cases with autonomic nerve disorders were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cases of central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vestibular disorders</z:e>, the incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were higher than the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average displacement angle of the basilar artery (n = 180) was 153.4 degrees +/- 39.4 degrees (mean +/- S.D.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRA findings were classified into five categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were classified as category III, which represented unilateral partial vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection rate for category III and IV abnormalities by neurological examination was higher than that for the other categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MRI and MRA are important methods to examine patients with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Distal vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> may carry a higher risk of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
