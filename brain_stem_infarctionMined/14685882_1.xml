<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ROW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HHT patients predominantly become symptomatic through <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004406'>recurrent epistaxis</z:hpo>, a symptom that can alert physicians at an early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate whether occult, visceral arterio-venous malformations could be detected by screening imaging studies in patients suffering from HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a comprehensive diagnostic study, Rendu-Osler-Weber patients were examined for potential visceral arterio-venous malformations by physical examination and non-invasive imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Department of Otolaryngology of the Philipps University of Marburg is a major referral center and coordinated the screening procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five individuals with the presumed diagnosis of HHT gave informed consent to the screening investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 35 individuals were found to suffer from visceral vascular malformations; most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were diagnosed in the lung, but also the liver, spleen, brain and eyes were affected </plain></SENT>
