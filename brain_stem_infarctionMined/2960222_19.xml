<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have thus far treated 17 cases of vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and one case of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> by intravascular balloon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical presenting symptoms included vertebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar insufficiency</z:e>, repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>), and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed successful transluminal angioplasty in 16 patients with marked narrowing (greater than 70%) of the dominant vertebral artery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with tandem <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> was also treated by angioplasty techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiography at 3- to 12-month intervals has revealed continued patency at the angioplasty site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications occurred in our one patient with basilar artery angioplasty, who suffered a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> after treatment, and in one patient who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> after bilateral vertebral artery angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two other patients had residual vertebral stenosis but remained asymptomatic after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients who had successful <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> were asymptomatic at 6 months to 2 years (mean, 15 months) of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These initial studies indicate that vertebral artery angioplasty may be effective for treating high-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> and for improving blood flow to the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty of the basilar artery is technically more difficult and has a higher degree of risk because of the many perforating branches supplying the brainstem </plain></SENT>
