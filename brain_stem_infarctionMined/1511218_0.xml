<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>As experience with it accumulates, high resolution MRI seems more capable of representing morphological alterations of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system than cranial computer tomography (CCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question thus arises whether the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> with MRI might not be easier than with CCT and how the topography of brainstem lesions demonstrated with MRI correlate with clinical symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>16 patients with definite clinical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> were examined by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The examination took place between the 10th and 14th day after the occurrence of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using MRI, we found pathological results in only 8 of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In only 5 of these cases a clear relationship between the neurological picture and the topography of the lesion could be shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that despite the high quality of the MRI images, the clinical examination for symptoms and signs is more important than imaging in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
