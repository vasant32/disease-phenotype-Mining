<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that affects the medulla oblongata and/or pons can result in tetra pareses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> of the lower cranial nerves while other parts of the brain remain intact, thus locking the person in </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence and prevalence is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to communicate the need for and benefits of a comprehensive rehabilitation and a standardized way of approaching the locked-in person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: To illustrate the rehabilitation process, we present four cases to highlight the needs of the person and what is required of the team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: â€‚ Communication at arrival: three persons communicated through eye movement, one by weak voice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (1-6 years later): computer assisted communication was used by two persons, a letter board by one and 'ordinary communication' by one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for follow-up not only to re-assess skills and needs partly owing to new technologies but also to see whether the person needs more assistance to adapt to the alternative means of communication or whether the carers of the person need extra information about communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the low incidence of the syndrome necessitates a skilled team in which different professionals can together assess the person </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This probably requires some centralization </plain></SENT>
