<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationships between perception of verticality by different sensory modalities, lateropulsion and pushing behaviour and lesion location were investigated in 86 patients with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Participants sat restrained in a drum-like framework facing along the axis of rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They gave estimates of their subjective postural vertical by signalling the point of feeling upright during slow drum rotation which tilted them rightwards-leftwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjective visual vertical was indicated by setting a line to upright on a computer screen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The haptic vertical was assessed in darkness by manually setting a rod to the upright </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> estimates ranged from -2.5 degrees to 2.5 degrees for visual vertical and postural vertical, and from -4.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees for haptic vertical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of six patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ipsilesional lateropulsion only one had an abnormal ipsilesional postural vertical tilt (6 degrees ); six had an ipsilesional visual vertical tilt (13 +/-.4 degrees ); two had ipsilesional haptic vertical tilts of 6 degrees  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 80 patients with a hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (35 with contralesional lateropulsion including 6 'pushers'), 34 had an abnormal contralesional postural vertical tilt (average -8.5 +/- 4.7 degrees ), 44 had contralesional visual vertical tilts (average -7 +/- 3.2 degrees ) and 26 patients had contralesional haptic vertical tilts (-7.8 +/- 2.8 degrees ); none had ipsilesional haptic vertical or postural vertical tilts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (26%) showed no tilt of any modality, 41 (52%) one or two abnormal modality(ies) and 18 (22%) a transmodal contralesional tilt (i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> + VV + HV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postural vertical was more tilted in right than in left hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and specifically biased by damage to neural circuits centred around the primary somatosensory cortex and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This shows that thalamo-parietal projections have a functional role in the processing of the somaesthetic graviceptive information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tilts of the postural vertical were more closely related to postural disorders than tilts of the visual vertical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a transmodal tilt showed a severe lateropulsion and 17/18 a right hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the right hemisphere plays a key role in the elaboration of an internal model of verticality, and in the control of body orientation with respect to gravity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with a 'pushing' behaviour showed a transmodal tilt of verticality perception and a severe postural vertical tilt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We suggest that pushing is a postural behaviour that leads patients to align their erect posture with an erroneous reference of verticality </plain></SENT>
