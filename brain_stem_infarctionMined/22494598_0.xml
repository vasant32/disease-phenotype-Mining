<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A case of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025229" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melioidosis</z:e> is reported in a patient presenting with brainstem signs to increase awareness of the uncommon presentations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025229" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melioidosis</z:e> that may cause a delayed diagnosis in the ED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man who worked as a construction worker, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and alcoholic liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, presented to the ED after a 10-day period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and cough </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was initially diagnosed and treated as a case of community-acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a sudden change in consciousness with 6th and 7th <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> and flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> were noted while he was in the ED, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging disclosed brainstem lesions, slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood and urine cultures subsequently yielded Burkholderia pseudomallei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abdominal computed tomography revealed multiple small consolidated patches, ground-glass opacities, small nodules in the lower lungs bilaterally, and a pancreatic tail <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025229" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melioidosis</z:e> with lung, pancreas, urogenic tract, and brainstem involvement was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after admission, the patient died from a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004086'>asystole</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In light of this case, patients with identifiable risk factors, especially underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, a history of positive soil contact, and those who lived in an endemic area or ever traveled to an endemic area, and who present themselves with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and neurologic deficit or multi-organ involvement, should have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025229" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melioidosis</z:e> considered in the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
