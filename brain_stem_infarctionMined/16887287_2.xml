<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1993 to 2002 a total of 44 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Until 1998 radiotherapy was given with 6 MV <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> in standard fractionation of 2.0 Gy 5 times per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1998 proton therapy became available and was used since then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A dose of 20 to 22.5 Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE) 68 MeV protons was given on 4 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progressive symptoms or deterioration of vision were the indications for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 44 patients treated, 36 had circumscribed choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> and 8 had diffuse choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> (DCH) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 19 were treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> with a total dose in the range of 16 to 30 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 25 patients were irradiated with protons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with DCH but 1 were treated with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Stabilization of visual acuity was achieved in 93.2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> thickness decreased in 95.4% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> resolved in 92.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Late effects, although generally mild or moderate, were frequently detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 40.9% showed radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo>, maximum Grade I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> was found in 29.5% of cases, but only 1 patient experienced more than Grade II severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>Retinopathy</z:hpo> and radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> were reversible in some of the patients and in some resolved completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>No differences could be detected between patients with circumscribed choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> treated with protons and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Treatment was less effective in DCH patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is effective in treating choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> with respect to visual acuity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> thickness but a benefit of proton therapy could not be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Side effects are moderate but careful monitoring for side effects should be part of the follow-up procedures </plain></SENT>
