<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>Epistaxis</z:hpo> is usually the first and most common symptom in hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT), which is known also as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The severity of HHT-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> is highly variable and can affect the patient's quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the literature, the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in HHT patients has been described in a few countries but not from the Norwegian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This work focused on the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in the Norwegian population in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with three or four Cura√ßao criteria were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> was graded depending on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> intensity, frequency, and the amount of blood transfusion during a period of 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> grades were studied in association with age, gender, gene mutation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, and whether the patient had or had not been treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> during the last 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the HHT patients (90%) complained of mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven percent of the patients started <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> by or before the age of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The progression of HHT-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> with age could not be proved statistically in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the grades of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> between HHT1 and HHT2 type, neither between female and male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients started <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> by or before the age of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> between non-ENG, non-ALK1 carrier patients, and ENG or ALK1 carrier patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with other populations, the grading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in Norwegian patients with HHT gave generally similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A multicenter epidemiological study is required to get a larger study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A common internationally accepted grading or classification system for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in HHT is highly recommended </plain></SENT>
