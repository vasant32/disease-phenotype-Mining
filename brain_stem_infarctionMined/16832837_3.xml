<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our own cases and searched for cases from Medline that met the criteria of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> involving fetal thigh </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> involving fetal thigh, totaling 21, were collected for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These included 19 cases from Medline search and two cases from our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases with lesions involving right thigh, left thigh, and both thighs were 12:8:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gender of affected fetuses was 9 male, 9 female, and 3 unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 21 cases, 6 fetuses (28.57%, 6/21) had isolated thigh lesions, and the other 15 cases (71.43%, 15/21) had extensive lesions involving pelvis, abdomen, retroperitoneum, or thorax </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prenatal presentations varied with hypoechoic cystic mass with limb asymmetry, 95.23% (20/21); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, 38.09% (8/21); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>, 19.04% (4/21); thick placenta, 9.52% (2/21); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001790'>nonimmune hydrops fetalis</z:hpo>, 9.52% (2/21); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001562'>oligohydramnios</z:hpo>, 4.76% (1/21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten cases (47.62%, 10/21) underwent termination of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For those who continued with pregnancy, the rate of complications with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221025" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kasabach-Merritt syndrome</z:e> was 36.36% (4/11) and the mortality rate in the neonatal period was 45.45% (5/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The causes of neonatal mortality in these five cases included consumption <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221025" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kasabach-Merritt syndrome</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> involving fetal thigh is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our review showed that the location of involvement on the right thigh is more than on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Males and females were equally affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nearly three fourths of the cases had extensive involvement over other parts of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Prenatal ultrasound finding of a raised thigh mass of significant size and limb asymmetry were the most important features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was as high as 45.45% in the neonatal period </plain></SENT>
