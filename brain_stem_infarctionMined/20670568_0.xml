<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report results and problems of the endovascular treatment in 12 cases of intradural vertebral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were four complications related to interventional procedure and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three patients (25%), VDAs ruptured immediately after injection of contrast media or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> during the interventional procedure, which caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a case of bilateral VA dissection (8%), after proximal VA occlusion had been performed for unilateral VDA, contralateral dissection extended to the basilar artery resulting in brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the incidence of rebleeding of VDA during angiography and embolization is higher than that of usual saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Careful injection of contrast media and strict blood pressure control seems to be more important to prevent rebleeding in VDAs than intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since unilateral VA occlusion may extend contralateral dissection in a case of bilateral VA dissection, it is necessary to check contralateral VA dissection before VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
