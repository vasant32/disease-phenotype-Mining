<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiogenic factor gene AGGF1 was previously identified as a candidate susceptibility gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, but further genetic studies are needed to firmly establish the genetic relationship between AGGF1 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed HapMap data and identified two tagSNPs, rs13155212 and rs7704267 that capture information for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common variants in AGGF1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two SNPs were genotyped in 173 Caucasian <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients and 477 Caucasian non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> controls, and both significantly associated with susceptibility for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> (P= 0.004 and 0.013, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Permutation testing also showed a significant empirical P value for the association (empirical P= 0.006 and 0.015, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To control for potential confounding due to population stratification, the population structure for both cases and controls was characterized by genotyping of 38 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) and the STRUCTURE program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association between the AGGF1 SNPs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> remained significant after multivariate analysis by incorporating the inferred cluster scores as a covariate or after removal of outlier individuals identified by STRUCTURE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that common AGGF1 variants confer risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
