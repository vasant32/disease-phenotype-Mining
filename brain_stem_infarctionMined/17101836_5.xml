<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical, radiologic, and autopsy findings of a 41-year-old patient treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6889">methylprednisolone acetate</z:chebi> cervical epidural steroid injection, who developed a fatal hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> and to discuss the possible mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pain management center and tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediately following a seemingly uncomplicated epidural steroid injection at C5-6, the patient developed progressive symptoms of extensive brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> (documented by magnetic resonance imaging and autopsy) with hemorrhagic conversion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> within the adventitia of the left vertebral artery, but no dissection, was found at the C5 vertebral level at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case report shows the possibility of serious intracranial pathology resulting from cervical epidural steroid injection despite use of fluoroscopic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vascular spasm distant to the site of injection is a possible mechanism </plain></SENT>
