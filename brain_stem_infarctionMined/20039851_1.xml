<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction after selective and partial destruction of diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroidal haemangioma</z:e> (DCH) by transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) using an 810 nm infrared diode laser in two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> having <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (LOJG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An interventional small case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Laser spots (diameter, 1 mm) were applied to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> surface located outside the posterior pole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Energy level (600-1700 mW) and exposure time (1-4 seconds) were increased stepwise until the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> exhibited a greyish discoloration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment was split into 2-4 sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before TTT, both patients had uncontrolled LOJG with an IOP of 23 mmHg (Case 1) and 45 mmHg (Case 2) in spite of topical medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases, TTT led to normalization of IOP to 15 mmHg and 24 mmHg, respectively, and stopped the progression of LOJG during a follow-up period of 6 years (Case 1) and 1 year (Case 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>Visual loss</z:hpo> or other complications were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the close link that exists between LOJG and DCH in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A single treatment modality such as TTT may both reduce IOP in LOJG and help to prevent exudative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in DCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We believe that TTT is a good therapeutic option for SWS patients who have both DCH and LOJG </plain></SENT>
