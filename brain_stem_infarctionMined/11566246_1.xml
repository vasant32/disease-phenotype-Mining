<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly sensitive in detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> supratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) lesion size has been shown to correlate strongly with the neurologic deficit in middle cerebral artery territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data concerning infratentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the size and evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain stem ischemic lesions and their relationship to neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> of 11 patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed DWI in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in 7/11 patients within 24 h, T2W sequences within the first 2 weeks (10/11 patients) and follow-up MRI (MR2) within 3-9 months (median 4.8 months) later (12/12 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion volumes were compared with early and follow-up neurologic deficit as determined by National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: the relative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes--with MR2 lesion size set to 100%--decreased over the time (P&lt;0.02) with a mean shrinking factor of 3.3 between DWI (MR0) and the follow-up MRT (P&lt;0.02), and 1.6 between early T2W (MR1) and MR2 (P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean DWI volume size (MR0) was larger than the early T2W (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although neurological outcome was good in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (mean NIHSS score of 1.3 at follow-up), early NIHSS and follow-up NIHSS scores were strongly correlated (r=0.9, P&lt;0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NIHSS score at follow-up was highly correlated with lesion size of DWI (MR0; r=0.71, P&lt;0.04) and T2W of MR1 (r=0.86, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: in this study, we saw a shrinking of the brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume according to clinical improvement of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Great extension of restricted diffusion in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage does not necessarily implicate a large resulting infarction or a bad clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
