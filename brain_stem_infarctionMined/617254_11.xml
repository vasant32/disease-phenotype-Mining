<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past three years we have studied 24 such cases: 14 following cardiopulmonary arrest, 6 following <z:hpo ids='HP_0005943'>respiratory arrest</z:hpo>, and 3 following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 9 patients who survived, only 1 had a significant neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that: (1) alpha-pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> can result from a variety of neurological insults; (2) a significant proportion of patients survive, often with little or no deficit; (3) clinical evidence of intact brainstem function implies a favorable outcome; (4) the electroencephalogram was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors and did not differentiate diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> from focal brainstem disease; and (5) neuropathological studies demonstrated diffuse cortical as well as brainstem changes </plain></SENT>
