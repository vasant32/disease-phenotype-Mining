<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the ischemic lesions distribution and extension of patients with basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by the means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 17 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the basilar artery, MRI was performed, including T2-weighted, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences in the short-term phase (&lt;48 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The shapes of ischemic lesions were obtained by graphic software and overlapped on a representative layer outline background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MRA showed basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and the DWI revealed different patterns of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients showed multiple lesions within the posterior circulation territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions more often occurred in pontes, cerebellums and mesencephalons than medullas, thalami and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar pons, cerebral crus and cerebellum hemisphere were more susceptible than pontine tegmentum, vermis, midbrain tegmentum and tectum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When the basilar artery is occluded, basilar pons, cerebral crus and cerebellum hemisphere were most susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The branches with smaller lumen of basilar artery, which are easier to be affected, are thought to be the cause of such a phenomenon </plain></SENT>
