<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 42-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> (hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>) and a huge pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> that involved the entire right middle lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> and intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0004749'>atrial flutter</z:hpo> for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A chest radiograph showed a discrete shadowing of the middle part of the right lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>Arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> was suspected based on the echocardiographic finding of immediate bubble detection in the left atrium on introducing echocardiographic contrast medium into the venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atrial shunt was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a huge pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> in the entire middle lobe of the right lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A trial of interventional embolization was performed, but the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> made it impossible to achieve complete closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> segmental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patient complained of unusual, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> after implantation of the first coil, so that the coil had to be removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore the patient underwent surgical resection of the entire right middle lobe and the upper part of the right lower lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Anatomy</z:mp> was clearly delineated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> connecting vessels were suture-closed, but both lungs showed diffuse microscopic superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004952'>pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo>, which were too small to be detected by angiography and which were also partly closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful: the patient recovered completely, she no longer had <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp>, and blood gas analysis showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> P(aO)(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether the patient's improved physical performance will last, because the development of diffuse microscopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> bilaterally in the lungs is not predictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore close follow-up is necessary and in the case of recurrence (ie, enlargement of the existing small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath>), early interventional embolization should be performed </plain></SENT>
