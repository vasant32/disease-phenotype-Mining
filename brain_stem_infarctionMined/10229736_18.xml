<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditional spectral and nonspectral methods have shown that heart rate (HR) variability is reduced after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some patients with poor outcome, however, show randomlike, complex patterns of HR behavior that traditional analysis techniques are unable to quantify </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we designed the present study to evaluate the complexity and correlation properties of HR dynamics after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by using new analysis methods based on nonlinear dynamics and fractals ("chaos theory") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In addition to the traditional spectral components of HR variability, we measured instantaneous beat-to-beat variability and long-term continuous variability analyzed from Poincaré plots, fractal correlation properties, and approximate entropy of R-R interval dynamics from 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings in 30 healthy control subjects, 31 hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and 15 brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (8 medullary, 7 pontine) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, the traditional spectral components of HR variability and the long-term continuous variability from Poincaré plots were impaired (P&lt;0.01) in patients with hemispheric and medullary brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but not in patients with pontine brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in comparison with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, measures of HR variability in hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were still lower (P&lt;0.05) than those of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various complexity and fractal measures of HR variability were similar in patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The conventional frequency domain measures of HR variability as well as the Poincaré measures showed strong correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient, r=0.68 to r=0.90) with each other but only weak correlations (r=0.09 to r=0.56) with the complexity and fractal measures of HR variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemispheric and medullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> seem to damage the cardiovascular autonomic regulatory system and appear as abnormalities in the magnitude of HR variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities can be more easily detected with the use of analysis methods of HR variability, which are based on moment statistics, than by methods based on nonlinear dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Abnormal HR variability may be involved in prognostically unfavorable cardiac complications and other known manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
