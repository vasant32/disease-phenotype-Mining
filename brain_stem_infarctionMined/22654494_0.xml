<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To quantify the long-term outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> and surgical success rates following pseudo 360-degree trabeculotomy surgery at Children's Medical Center in Dallas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: An International Classification of Diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9) database was utilized for a retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight eyes of 24 who underwent primary trabeculotomy with a pseudo 360-degree technique between June 1, 1992 and December 31, 2005 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at the time of trabeculotomy was 11.1 ± 3.0 months, with seven eyes operated on after 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 85.1 ± 9.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean intraocular pressure (IOP) at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> diagnosis was 32.7 ± 1.1 mmHg, and final mean IOP for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes (after trabeculotomy and any additional surgery and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> medications) was 17.9 ± 0.8 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With trabeculotomy and medication alone, mean final IOP was 19.9 ± 1.1 mmHg, with a mean drop in IOP of 12.5 ± 1.4 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical success, defined by adequate IOP control, was achieved in 30 eyes (78.96%) at most recent follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated 5- and 10-year survival probabilities of 93.1% and 66.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen eyes (44.7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes) achieved complete success, meaning IOP control &lt;21 mmHg without additional medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seventeen had <z:hpo ids='HP_0008007'>primary congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> (PCG); no eyes with aphakic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (AG) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> achieved complete success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven eyes (18.4%) failed primary trabeculotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mean time to failure was 46.9 ± 8.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eyes with SWS had a significantly higher failure rate (P = 0.009) and a 5.81 relative risk of failure (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our long-term trabeculotomy success rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> compare favorably with existing reports in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eyes with AG and SWS may warrant consideration of alternative primary surgical methods, or closer postoperative surveillance </plain></SENT>
