<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lesions, neurological manifestations at initial physical status examinations, cognitive function, swallowing function and outcome [activities of daily living (ADL), status of nutritional intake at discharge and destination after discharge] were evaluated in 68 patients (47 males and 21 females) who had pontine lesions with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean length of stay was 24.4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The symptoms (number of patients) observed included <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> (50), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (47), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (18), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> (11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> (49) and poor cognitive performance (37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The types of lesions (number of patients) included lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the ventral pontine area (15), lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the dorsal pontine area (13) and large lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LLIs) (41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After hospital discharge, 23 patients were discharged home, 44 were transferred to another hospital and 1 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients were on a regular diet, 22 were receiving a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> diet and 22 were on enteral feeding at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with LLIs more frequently had poor cognitive performance, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> at discharge and a tendency for a longer length of stay compared with patients who had lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients who returned home were those who were younger in age, had fewer neurological symptoms, had better cognitive function and ADL performance, and could ingest food </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> hospital, age, neurological symptoms, ADL, cognitive function, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> were considered important factors for determining the outcome in patients with pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
