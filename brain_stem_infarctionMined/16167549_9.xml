<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the literature, there are reports of CSA caused by brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two patients (38 and 53 years old) with longstanding history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnoea</z:hpo> who died during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases the autopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bilateral hypoxic lesions at the level of the solitary tract nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one case, symmetrical selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was found in the dorsal part of the solitary tract nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> obstructive vasculopathy was also found, with thickening and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> of the smallest vessels of the medullary tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other case, bilateral infarctions were found with the base at the ependymal lining of the 4th ventricle floor and the apex towards the solitary tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intramural hemorrhagic lesion in the premedullary segment of the left vertebral artery was also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Episodes of hypoxemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> during sleep may worsen the effects of focal oligohemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the medullary tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of the solitary tract nuclei may be the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> fatal lesion in patients with both <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnoea</z:hpo> and lesions of the vertebro-basilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neuropathologic report of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> medullary ischemic-hypoxic lesions which may not be considered the cause of the CSA because of their recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that CSA, besides being caused by ischemic events at the level of the medulla, may also contribute to pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, through <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or hemodynamic oscillations </plain></SENT>
