<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology (DPN), or were seen as inpatients in the Pediatric Wards at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> work-up for each suspected case included hemostatic assays, serological, biochemical and neurophysiological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging modalities included routine skull x-rays, CT, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 104 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies were the underlying risk factor in 7 (6.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were evaluated at the DPN at a mean age of 66 months (range = 8 months to 11 years, median = 6 years); and they had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at a mean age of 48 months (range = 2 months to 10 years, median = 8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">neurocutaneous syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> associated with SWS, and the fourth had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> secondary to ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A girl (aged 9 years and 4 months) had left posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000113'>polycystic kidney disease</z:hpo> following renal ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She died 5 months later despite surgical intervention (clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The second child was an 8-month-old boy who presented with subarachnoid and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH) following ruptured anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>He recovered with no residual symptoms following successful clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>Arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) caused IVH in a 7-year-old boy who reported to hospital 5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>, and dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Following drainage of the IVH and stabilization of the patient, the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was successfully embolized 6 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As a group, congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies constitute a significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Saudi children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recognition of these diseases is important since some are treatable and because other family members may be at risk </plain></SENT>
