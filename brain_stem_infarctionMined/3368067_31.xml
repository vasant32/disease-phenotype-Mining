<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 43-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> bilateral VA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The man had multiple episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and necropsy showed multiple dissections and defects in the internal elastica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The woman had many brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other patients had SAH and unilateral dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial VA dissection causes four overlapping syndromes: (1) brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are usually due to subintimal dissection extending into the basilar artery, affect younger patients, and often are single fatal events; (2) SAH is due to subadventitial or transmural dissection; (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> cause mass effect on the brainstem and lower cranial nerves; and (4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dissections due to connective tissue defects cause extensive bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and SAH </plain></SENT>
