<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) is a useful diagnostic technique in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>hypercortisolism</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or equivocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure is believed to be safe, with mostly minor complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are rare, but severe, neurologic complications that need to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an institutional review board-approved retrospective review of our institutional IPSS experience from July 2001 to January 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IPSS was performed for the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end points of particular interest were the indications for IPSS and the incidence of associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period of 5(1/2) years, 44 patients underwent IPSS for evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 33 women and 11 men with a mean age of 43.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of equivocal imaging and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> testing, 36 of 44 patients underwent IPSS, and 8 of 44 underwent IPSS after failed transsphenoidal exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only complication was injury to the brain stem that occurred after an unremarkable procedure in a 42-year-old woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She developed clinical evidence of pontomedullary dysfunction with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cause of this injury is unclear, but a venous variant leading to transient venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neurologic injury is a rare but serious complication associated with IPSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite this, if performed under a strict paradigm, IPSS is both accurate and safe and can be very useful in the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221406" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cushing disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
