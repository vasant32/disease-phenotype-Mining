<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally believed that repeated short periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> are safer for the brain than a single long episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify whether interrupted and uninterrupted vessel occlusion differs with regard to changes in brain tissue and cerebral hemodynamics after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty Spraque Dawley rats (300-350 g) were placed under general anaesthesia and ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was exposed through a transclival approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) values was measured, and then the basilar artery was punctured, causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group I (n = 24) was subjected to 60 min of interrupted basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, defined as 5 min of reperfusion after every 10 min of occlusion, group II (n = 26) 60 min of uninterrupted <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three days after completion of the experiment, each rat was neurologically evaluated and decapitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coronal brain slices were obtained and stained to assess <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immediately after SAH, LCBF fell by 58% in group I, and by 52% in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group I, each ischemic insult brought a similar reduction in LCBF, and after each release of the occlusion there was a rapid rise in flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In group II, the LCBF values dropped initially and remained at low levels until the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> stained sections showed similar volumes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> in both groups (38.3 +/- 9.2 mm3 vs. 34.3 +/- 8.7 mm3, respectively; p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that there is no neuroprotective advantage to either interrupted or uninterrupted temporary blockage of blood flow during neurovascular procedures after SAH in the basilar artery region </plain></SENT>
