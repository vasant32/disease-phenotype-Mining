<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their ages at the time of treatment ranged from 2 to 40 years, with a mean of 19.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indications for treatment included progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> in five patients, spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in four, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the cause of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> may have been related to epidural anesthesia traumatizing a low <z:hpo ids='HP_0002144'>tethered cord</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographically, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were subclassified in three groups: a single-hole <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> supplied by a single feeding medullary artery (three patients); a single-hole <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> supplied by multiple medullary arteries (three patients); and multiple separate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> supplied by multiple medullary arteries (four patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were classified as perimedullary Type III and two as perimedullary Type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Embolic agents were delivered from transarterial routes in 14 procedures and transvenous routes in 2 procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 embolizations and 8 operations were performed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were cured of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (as demonstrated by angiography), two patients had 5% residual filling and are scheduled for future therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One refused a follow-up angiographic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications related to embolization included rupture of the anterior spinal artery by a detachable balloon, resulting in transient worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> with recovery to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transient worsening of symptoms after surgery was common, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients returned to baseline or better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dramatic improvement was observed in four patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
