<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vertebrojugular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> after penetrating cervical trauma (gunshot or stab wounds) are rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Successful endovascular coil embolization of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> fistulizing vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm involving an obstructed internal jugular vein is presented and the various treatment strategies for such a lesion are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old man presented from an outside institution after sustaining 2 gunshot wounds in a civilian conflict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging revealed a right vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm, which formed a fistulous connection with the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because venous outflow obstruction was present just below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, a high-flow shunt was directed intracranially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the pseudoaneurysm and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> were accessed percutaneously via a transfemoral route and coil embolization was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion of the basilar artery circulation was assumed by the contralateral vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral posteroinferior cerebellar artery filled through retrograde flow down the vertebral confluence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coil embolization is a safe and reliable strategy by which to obliterate an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> traumatic vertebrojugular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> as well as pseudoaneurysm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serial angiographic follow-up is mandatory to document a persistent cure </plain></SENT>
