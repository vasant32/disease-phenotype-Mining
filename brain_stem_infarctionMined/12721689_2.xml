<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Angiodysplastic lesions of the extremities are very often of great interest for the orthopedist, involving not only bones with length discrepancy, but also joints with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005261'>hemarthrosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005186'>synovial hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe 4 patients with cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0007461'>hemangiomatosis</z:hpo> in the lower limb and a concomitant knee <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Like in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathies</z:hpo>, the articular damage is rapidly invasive and leads to progressive damage in the joint if not adequately diagnosed and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We treated the 4 patients at different ages, corresponding to different stages of intra-articular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative management included MRI and diagnostic arthroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent an open synovectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> our patients were reviewed at a clinical and radiographic follow-up after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the range of motion was improved or at least not worsened after surgery, in spite of a larger extent of cutaneous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>X-ray and MRI confirmed clinical data showing no recurrence of the lesion inside the joint and no progression of the articular damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical outcomes were very good or good in the patients treated early, poorer in the patient operated on at an adult age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The importance of an early and precise diagnosis and of an accurate preoperative planning must be underlined </plain></SENT>
