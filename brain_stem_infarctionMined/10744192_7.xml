<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to delineate the incidence and outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> among hospitalized patients who were referred for rehabilitation because of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 36 patients who were admitted because of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Information on the patients' clinical features, feeding status, and the results of clinical and videofluoroscopic swallowing examinations were obtained through chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up interviews were conducted via telephone to learn the general medical condition and feeding status of the patients 7-43 mo after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 81% of the patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> at the time of initial clinical swallowing evaluation, which was performed 10-75 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 79% of the dysphagic individuals depended on tube feeding at the initial evaluation; 22% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals could not resume oral intake at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses revealed a significant association between poor outcome and disease involving the medulla, the presence of a wet voice during the initial swallowing test, and a delay or absence of the swallowing reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> was 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a correlation between the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> by modified <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> meal videofluoroscopy and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up interviews showed that 88% of the 27 patients who were contacted had resumed full oral intake 4 mo after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was relatively high in our study population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The long-term outcome was favorable </plain></SENT>
