<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> in atypical frontoparietotemporal locations without an associated facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence of a leptomeningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> was found in each when they were evaluated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of a leptomeningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> was suggested by calcifications noted on computed tomographic scan of the head and confirmed with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that given the lack of occipital involvement with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, and therefore the noncontiguous nature of this lesion with the developing upper facial ectoderm, the failure to develop a facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> would be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the useof an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> along with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> prophylactic medication appeared to have the greatest efficacy in these two cases, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> alone were less helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This diagnosis should be considered in any child presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>intracranial calcifications</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
