<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Only a limited number of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the peripheral cerebellar arteries have been previously described, and very few of these cases involve the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the rarity of these lesions, there is little consensus regarding prognosis and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with two cases of complex peripheral SCA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and review the existing literature on this fascinating entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: Two patients, both with SCA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> not amenable to endovascular treatment underwent microsurgical clipping, one with the associated removal of a tentorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each procedure a combined subtemporal, presigmoidal approach was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical clips were utilized to reconstruct the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and both patients were discharged without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical management of complex distal SCA fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is challenging and options include wrap/clip reconstruction, proximal occlusion, trapping, and distal outflow occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When possible, preservation of the parent artery is preferred to mitigate the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If proximal occlusion or trapping are employed, we have advocated for the use of combined distal revascularization techniques to prevent permanent ischemic damage of the brainstem and cerebellar hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Peripherally dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the SCA is an uncommon entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Management of these lesions is best handled by an experienced neuro-endovascular team combined with a neurovascular surgeon skilled in skull base approaches </plain></SENT>
