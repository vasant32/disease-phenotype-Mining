<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) provide assessment of vestibular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They consist in picking up compound muscle action potentials in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles in response to auditory stimulation of the vestibulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VEMP testing has found application mainly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031128" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral vestibular disorders</z:e>, whereas reports about VEMPs in central vestibular lesions are rather scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIMS OF THE STUDY: Based on the physiological connections between the cerebellum and the vestibular nuclei, we investigated the influence on VEMPs of cerebellar and lower-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined whether or not this method may be suitable as a clinical tool for the evaluation of the extent of cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 15 patients with lower-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (11 in the pons, four in the medulla) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latencies and amplitudes of P13 and N23 in both groups of patients were compared with those obtained in a control group of 53 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: VEMP responses were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the group level, mean peak latencies and amplitudes, and the number of subjects with significantly deviant values did not differ between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no latency or amplitude differences ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the individual level, there was no correlation between laterality of lesion and that of P13 or N23 abnormalities in patients with cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; however, there were two patients (one pontine, one medullar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) who presented P13 and N23 latency abnormalities ipsilaterally to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> do not influence VEMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, despite previous reports, we were unable to find at a group level any statistically significant VEMP changes in patients with lower-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, VEMPs do not appear a suitable tool for assessment of brainstem integrity in patients with posterior fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, they could constitute a sensitive method for documentation of involvement of the central vestibular pathways in patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
