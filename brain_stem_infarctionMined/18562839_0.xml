<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vertical smooth pursuit had very low velocity in both directions without catch-up saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vertical and torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex gains were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preservation of vertical and torsional quick phases signifies integrity of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case is the first to provide evidence that disruption of descending cerebral corticofugal pathways to the riMLF with preserved ascending projections from the paramedian pontine reticular formation to the riMLF can cause a dissociated palsy of vertical fast eye movements </plain></SENT>
