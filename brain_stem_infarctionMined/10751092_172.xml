<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serious consequences may result if visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, particularly in the pulmonary circulation, are unrecognized and left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of the identification of two of the disease-causing genes (endoglin and ALK-1), only a clinical diagnosis of HHT can be provided for the majority of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On behalf of the Scientific Advisory Board of the HHT Foundation International, Inc., we present consensus clinical diagnostic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The four criteria (epistaxes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>, visceral lesions and an appropriate family history) are carefully delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HHT diagnosis is definite if three criteria are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of HHT cannot be established in patients with only two criteria, but should be recorded as possible or suspected to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If fewer than two criteria are present, HHT is unlikely, although children of affected individuals should be considered at risk in view of age-related penetration in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These criteria may be refined as molecular diagnostic tests become available in the next few years </plain></SENT>
