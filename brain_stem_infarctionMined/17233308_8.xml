<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors sought to analyze the success rate of surgery in the management of medically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and to determine whether the extent and timing of surgery affected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and developmental outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of 27 children who underwent surgery at their institution for medically resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and they examined the outcomes with regard to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> control and neuropsychological development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen children (63%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> when they were younger than 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were significantly more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (p &lt; or =0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> (p &lt; or = 0.001) and be developmentally delayed (p &lt; or = 0.025) than children whose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> started later in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent a hemispherectomy (either anatomical or functional), and complete resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients in whom a focal resection was performed, 11 (58%) became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 10 children in whom there was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> were more likely to have continuing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> than the nine whose lesions were completely excised (p&lt; or = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen children exhibited improvement in their developmental status following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This improvement was significantly affected by completeness of resection (p&lt; or = 0.05) and age at surgery (p&lt; or = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> freedom per se was not affected by the timing of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medically <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> in children can be treated effectively by surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The degree of resection or disconnection of diseased tissue, but not patient age at the time of surgery, is an important factor in achieving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early surgery is more likely to improve developmental outcome </plain></SENT>
