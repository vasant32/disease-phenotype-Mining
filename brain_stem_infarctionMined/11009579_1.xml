<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SPECT findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> are reported and correlated with clinical and radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> that was diagnosed on clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria have been included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their age ranged between 5 and 62 years and four of them were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and SPECT using (99m)Tc-<z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">ethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17376">cystine</z:chebi> dimer were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of Barthel index (BI) score the patients' outcome was defined as complete (BI = 20), partial (BI = 19-12), and poor recovery (BI&lt;12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Eleven patients were in stage III and three each in stage II and stage I <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography was abnormal in 11 out of 16 patients and revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in nine, basal exudates, infarction in subcortical white matter and basal ganglia in six patients each, frontal cortical infarction in one, and granulomata in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cranial MRI was carried out in four patients and revealed multiple granulomata, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> in two patients each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SPECT studies were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except two patients and revealed hypoperfusion of the basal ganglia in 14, cortical hypoperfusion in 10, and midbrain hypoperfusion in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the three month follow up four patients had died, five had poor, three partial, and five complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The SPECT studies were more frequently abnormal compared with computed tomography but did not correlate with stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> subcortical and cortical hypoperfusion is common but it does not correlate with stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or three month outcome </plain></SENT>
