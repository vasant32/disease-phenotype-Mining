<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Introduced by McKenzie in 1938,(1) it is indicated for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that predominantly first occur in infancy and early childhood, arise diffusely from one hemisphere, and are associated with unihemispheric insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These include <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo>, other multilobar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasias</z:hpo>, perinatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, and Rasmussen <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improvements in surgical techniques and patient selection criteria have resulted in lower complication rates, including lower mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because hemispherectomy is often performed in children who already have moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, the added motor deficits from the surgery are generally low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, given the plasticity in the developing brain, surgery when done early may allow reorganization and preservation of both motor and cognitive function </plain></SENT>
