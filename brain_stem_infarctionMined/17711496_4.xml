<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A prospectively electronic database of colorectal laparoscopic procedures identified nine consecutive patients with sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> managed by colonoscopic decompression followed by same admission laparoscopic recto-sigmoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 2001 and February 2007, nine patients, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> I (one), II (four), III (four) with sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> were treated: seven were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their age distribution was 37-87 years (median 64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> was the first episode in one patient, the second episode for four and the third (or more) for the remainder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median operation time was 115 min (45-145) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No anastomosis was de-functioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> was parenteral <z:chebi fb="58" ids="46195">paracetamol</z:chebi> (eight) supplemented by 10 mg oral <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> in one case; a ninth patient received patient controlled parenteral <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> for 36 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications included: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> (one), myocardial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (one) and wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on day 32 from a brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven had an uncomplicated recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median postoperative stay was 4 days (2-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic recto-sigmoidectomy postcolonoscopic decompression is a good option for patients with sigmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002580'>volvulus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications are minimal and recovery is quick </plain></SENT>
