<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These slow-flow lesions can affect any tissue or organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, a cutaneous VM is characterized by a bluish mass that is compressible on palpation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phleboliths are commonly present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms depend on location and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>VM are often <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and isolated, however, they can be associated with other malformations and be part of a syndrome; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e> (capillary-lymphatico-venous malformation with limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) is the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glomuvenous malformation (GVM) is another type of venous anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to VM, GVM is often painful on palpation and not compressible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis of VM is often made in the presence of a bluish cutaneous lesion: however, other lesions can mimick VM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent anomalies are a blue <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>naevus</z:hpo>, a hemorrhagic lymphatic malformation, a sub-cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> or even the presence of dilated superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> veins due to underlying venous stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This chapter will detail the clinical characteristics of venous anomalies and their differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
