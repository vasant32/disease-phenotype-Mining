<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the first reported case utilizing anterior-to-posterior circulation approach for a successful mechanical thrombectomy and chemical thrombolysis of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery (BA) occlusion using the Penumbra <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 39-year-old man with known left vertebral artery (VA) occlusion presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">top of the basilar syndrome</z:e>, resulting in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> status with flaccid motor exam and no corneal reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Navigation of a guide catheter into the right VA was unsuccessful because of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> angle created by the previously placed right VA ostial stent that herniated into the subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left internal carotid artery-selective angiography revealed a prominent left posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Penumbra 026 reperfusion catheter was advanced into the thrombosed BA via the left internal carotid artery, the posterior communicating artery, and the P1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mechanical thrombectomy and chemical thrombolysis were successfully performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TIMI-3 in the BA and TIMI-2 flows in posterior cerebral arteries were restored 8 hours 16 minutes after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had recovered full strength in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four extremities at 10 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and had a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of 2 at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with unfavorable VA <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, anterior-to-posterior thrombectomy of the BA can be successfully achieved using the Penumbra catheter via an anatomically suitable posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
