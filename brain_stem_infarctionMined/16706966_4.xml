<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) affecting skin, mucosae and internal organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> often remain clinically silent until provoking sudden serious complications, responsible for important morbidity and mortality which can occur both in adulthood and in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> in HHT pediatric populations is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the screening protocol performed in the first genotypically confirmed HHT pediatric population and to estimate the incidence of occult brain, lung and liver <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and the different disease phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular analysis was performed on 35 children, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, who were family members of probands with a previously identified mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical-instrumental examination was performed on the mutation positive cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> were investigated by anterior rhinoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrast echocardiography and high resolution thoracic multislice computed tomography (CT) were performed to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0006548'>pulmonary arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp>), and echo-color Doppler, and abdominal CT to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0006574'>hepatic arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (HAVMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to detect cerebral angiopathic involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Molecular analysis demonstrated the mutation-carrier status in 22/35 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nineteen children, 12 of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, positive to molecular testing underwent clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nasal teleangiectases were found in 68%, mucocutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> (fingers, lips and oral cavity) in 79%, <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> in 53%, HAVMs in 47% and cerebral anteriovenous malformations and/or cerebral ischemic changes secondary to <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> in 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced a high incidence of HHT children with occult visceral lesions suggesting that a diagnostic screening may be indicated to appropriately treat brain and lung malformations </plain></SENT>
