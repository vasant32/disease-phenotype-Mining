<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In Case 1, a 54-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>, judgement of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was suspended initially, but was ultimately declared after the contractions were deemed to be spinal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI findings after declaration and autopsy were compatible with brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Case 2, a 27-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004787'>fulminant hepatitis</z:hpo> and subsequent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, judgement was postponed due to detection of the contractions at the second testing, and was ceased with family intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several cases of abnormal gross and fine movements in brain-dead patients have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These paradoxical phenomena may confuse an inexperienced examiner and delay the declaration of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> should be considered real <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the person or not, neurologists should be aware of the occasional presence of neurological problems in the diagnosis of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, such as spinally-mediated movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since the major opposition to brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is the distrust of medical doctors, we propose a pilot system of a "brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> judging doctor" </plain></SENT>
