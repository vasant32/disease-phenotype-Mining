<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Impaired cortical venous outflow and abnormal deep venous collaterals are common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e>, but their relation to brain metabolism and function is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging techniques, such as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were applied in conjunction with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (PET), to assess cortical and white matter structural abnormalities and their relation to cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and cognitive functions in children with unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen children (age, 1.5-10.3 years) with unilateral SWS underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging with SWI and DTI, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism PET, and comprehensive neuropsychologic assessment prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and PET images were coregistered and cortical regions showing decreased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were compared with locations of SWI signal intensity abnormalities, changes in white matter water diffusion, and cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SWI detected both cortical abnormalities (n=8) and deep transmedullary veins (n=9), including those in young children with no cortical SWI signal intensity changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These veins were often located under cortex adjacent to hypometabolic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DTI showed abnormal water diffusion both under hypometabolic cortex and in adjacent white matter with collateral veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> was associated with abnormal water diffusion in the posterior white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transmedullary venous collaterals can be detected early by SWI and persist in white matter adjacent to damaged cortex in children with SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microstructural white matter damage extends beyond cortical abnormalities and may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SWI and DTI can be incorporated into clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging acquisitions to objectively assess microstructural abnormalities at different stages of SWS </plain></SENT>
