<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pursuit movements, refixation saccades, and the vestibulo-ocular reflex were restricted to the temporal hemifield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only near convergence led to an adduction of 15 degrees in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nasally directed saccades were slow, and temporally directed saccades showed glissadic back-drift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electromyography revealed a lack of burst activity in the left medial rectus; however, inhibition of the left (homolateral) and the right (contralateral) medial rectus muscles during off-saccades and in off-positions of gaze was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that inhibition for medial rectus motor neurons is not mediated by the medial longitudinal fasciculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings are compatible with the neurophysiological data, which show that reductions of activity in the medial rectus motoneurons are largely caused by disfacilitation via internuclear neurons rather than by inhibition </plain></SENT>
