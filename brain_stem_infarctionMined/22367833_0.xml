<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>REVIEW SUMMARY: A 45-year-old woman with poorly controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000016'>urinary retention</z:hpo> was diagnosed 2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, along with the clinical evolution (The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale from 1 to 7; Medical Research Council scale from 4 to 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left medial pontine infarction, whereas urodynamic study showed detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001265'>hyporeflexia</z:hpo> 5 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PSUI started to improve along with urodynamic studies 10 days later and the Foley catheter was removed subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Left medial pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> causes detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001265'>hyporeflexia</z:hpo>, which has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More attention should be given to the appearance of PSUI because of its prognostic importance and because patients may not recognize their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000011'>neurogenic bladder</z:hpo> symptoms during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral shock phase </plain></SENT>
