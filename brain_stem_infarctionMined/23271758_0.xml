<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> (ages 1, 3, and 10 years) underwent structural and resting state functional MRI, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), and neurocognitive evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight different resting state networks were compared between the affected and unaffected hemispheres by quantitatively accessing communication efficiency measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly reduced efficiency values were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual network deficiency was present in both children with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo>; frontal network abnormalities were associated with fine motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Location of network abnormalities corresponded to and, in some cases, extended beyond structural MRI and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> PET abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presented approach can detect early functional abnormalities of specific brain networks in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
