<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extension of infarcted tissue to the pons surface has been indicated as a possible marker of basilar branch atheromatous disease and some neuroimaging evidence confirms this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On the basis of Kim's et al., study, we performed a revision of the literature addressing this topic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Several authors confirm an association between basilar artery branch disease and isolated pontine infarction; moreover, the enlargement of pontine lesion seems to be associated with neurological worsening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed a brief analysis of possible mechanisms of progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prospective studies could be useful to evaluate predictors of neurological worsening in pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvement of neuroimaging techniques is needed for a deeper comprehension of the etiopathogenesis of isolated pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
