<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebellar infarctions</z:e> are an important cause of neurologic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure to recognize and rapidly diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> may lead to serious morbidity and mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify sources of preventable medical errors, the authors obtained pilot data on cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> that were initially misdiagnosed in the emergency department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen cases of misdiagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> were collected, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seen, or reviewed by the authors during a five-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each patient, they report the presenting symptoms, the findings on neurologic examination performed in the emergency department, specific areas of the examination not performed or documented, diagnostic testing, the follow-up course after misdiagnosis, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The different types of errors leading to misdiagnosis are categorized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Half of the patients were younger than 50 years and presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had either incomplete or poorly documented neurologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had a computed tomographic scan of the head interpreted as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and most of these patients underwent subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initial incorrect diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005263'>gastritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality in this patient cohort was 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the survivors, about 50% had disabling deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pitfalls leading to misdiagnosis involved the clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and establishing a diagnosis and disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates how the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> can be missed or delayed in patients presenting to the emergency department </plain></SENT>
