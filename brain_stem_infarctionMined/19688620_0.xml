<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with pathological test results were not treated differently from those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The value of laboratory findings and MRI might increase if the results are categorized to more specific diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate diagnostic test batteries for SSNHL and evaluate their value in the management of idiopathic SSNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 400 patients submitted to the Swedish national database for SSNHL were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information was collected about the patient's past medical history, potential precipitating events, trauma, medical history, hearing loss, current disease, diagnostic protocol, and treatment, using questionnaires as well as two audiograms, one at the first ENT clinic visit and another 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 65% of these 400 patients underwent hematological tests and 40% had an MRI/CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 160 MRI investigated had pathological findings including 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>acoustic neuromas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, 300 of these 400 patients were evaluated as having idiopathic sudden <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> (ISSNHL); 24% of them had one or more pathological test results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between either the MRI findings or the laboratory findings with regard to treatment or hearing recovery in patients with ISSNHL </plain></SENT>
