<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0007110'>Central hypoventilation</z:hpo> and paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are uncommon complications of medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the combination of these autonomic complications of medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not previously been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient who experienced life-threatening paroxysmal attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> and vasomotor instability 3 months after medullary infarction, a combination of symptoms that is unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT, METHODS, AND RESULTS: Following a right lateral medullary infarction, an otherwise stable 70-year-old woman developed recurrent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> (PCO2), &gt; 100 mm Hg), blood pressure instability (systolic blood pressure, &gt; 200 to &lt; 100 mm Hg), and mental status changes (from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>) within hours of removal from mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These attacks occurred repeatedly after removal from mechanical ventilation and were prevented by diaphragm pacing with a phrenic nerve pacemaker and nocturnal mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A syndrome of life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0007110'>central hypoventilation</z:hpo> and vasomotor instability can occur after medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Placement of a phrenic nerve pacemaker can prevent these complications, without the functional limitations imposed by continuous mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
