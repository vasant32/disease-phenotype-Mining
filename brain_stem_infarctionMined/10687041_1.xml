<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe three patients with different brainstem lesions (bulbar <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, bulbar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Arnold-Chiari malformation</z:hpo>) who debuted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other neurological manifestations had gone unobserved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>Respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> worsened notably during sleep to the point that mechanical ventilation was required or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred (Ondine s curse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient with a bulbar <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> is stable with only assisted ventilation by a nasal route at night, with good quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our conclusions are that: a) central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system anomalies need to be investigated as possible causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> when lungs are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; b) the respiratory control of patients with brainstem lesions should be studied, particularly at night (polysomnography), and c) even when awake-state ventilation is adequate, nighttime assisted ventilation may be required </plain></SENT>
