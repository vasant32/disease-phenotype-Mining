<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of patients who suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> particularly brainstem damage) was conducted to look for risk factors which, present on admission, indicated the chance of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The evolution of 100 patients, hospitalized in the Neurology Department, University Hospital Lausanne, after having had their first <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk factors chosen were age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoker, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> as well as the conscious state, the location of the lesion and whether it was bi- or unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the data was performed by means of a stepwise multiple logistic regression program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or bilateral lesions, regardless of their position in the brainstem, or the combination of these two factors, indicated an unfavorable outcome, associated with a short term mortality rate greater than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In their absence and despite the presence of the other risk factors, it was less than 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At one month the mortality rate was shown to be very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At two month it was non insignificant and thereafter it became similar to that of the Swiss population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brainstem lesions extending to the vital centres or respiratory complications related to the state of dependence were the most common causes of short term <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At long term the aetiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was the same as for the population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The results obtained show the importance of the prevention and treatment of patients at risk of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, particularly <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To avoid the fatal complications, that arise from severe handicap in bedridden patients, the management must be rapid and efficient (physiotherapy and drugs) </plain></SENT>
