<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 31-year-old male known to have the PW syndrome involving the left leg since birth, presented with a 7-month-history of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> of the lower extremities and dysfunction of the bladder and bowel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Myelography demonstrated dilated intradural vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated two distinct single hole perimedullary arteriovenous fistulae near the conus at two different metameres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were supplied by the left posterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated by transarterial embolisation using polyvinyl alcohol particles, which resulted in venous side occlusion of the fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the treatment, the patient developed transient worsening of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> of the lower extremities, and was treated by heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After heparinization, the patient partially recovered from the pre-embolisation status of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The follow-up angiogram one year after the embolisation demonstrated persistent obliteration of both fistulae </plain></SENT>
