<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the cutaneous manifestations and the other features of this disorder was studied in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> had involvement of the upper eye lid or forehead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral cutaneous involvement was common and when present, was often associated with extensive lesions of the trunk and extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the cutaneous lesions appeared to be unrelated to that of the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of patients, the syndrome's "forme fruste," were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be no relationship between the presence and extent of the cutaneous lesions and the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder, difficulty of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control, intellectual deficit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, homonymous hemianopsia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>intracranial calcification</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Notably, the "forme fruste" patients appeared to be spared from glaucomatous involvement and from choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We will also discuss other aspects of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
