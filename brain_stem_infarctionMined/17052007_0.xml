<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He complained of dizziness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and subsequently developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilateral hearing loss</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI revealed multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and the right cerebral peduncle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three dimentional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) showed severe stenosis of bilateral vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were located in the border zone between anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) and superior cerebellar artery (SCA), suggesting hemodynamic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Auditory brain stem responses (ABR) were recorded three times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial ABR demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> waves except for wave I on day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wave I on the left was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while wave I peak latency on the right was prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 61, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> waves were recorded, although peak latencies of waves III to V and interpeak intervals of the wave I to III on the right side were prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Involvements of the cochlear nerve and pontine auditory pathway were suggested from the ABR abnormalities in this case </plain></SENT>
