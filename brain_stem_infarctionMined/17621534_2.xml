<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also, evolution of MRI abnormalities is largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This long-term follow-up study tries to address these two issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This retrospective and later prospective study followed 9 children with confirmed SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical details of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo>, neurologic and developmental deficits were ascertained specifically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> below or after 6 months of age for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disease was classified as active or inactive and correlations were made with the use of aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> past, as well as prospectively acquired imaging was reviewed by two independent blinded neuroradiologists and the images were analysed as ictal (temporally related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like event) or interictal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Degree and extent of leptomeningeal enhancement was specifically looked for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four boys and five girls were followed up for a mean of 6.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disease activity subsided in 8/9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients had a severe early course with significant residual deficits while <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> patients did uniformly well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients where aspirin was used, a stable course ensued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in degree/extent of leptomeningeal enhancement during an ictus which returned to the baseline in the interictal state in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients where both images were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> worsened in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SWS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like events before 6 months of age seem to do worse with a severe early course and persistent neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However the course stabilizes after 5 years of age in most </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> SWS patients have a benign course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Aspirin use is associated with a stable course though further studies are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The leptomeningeal enhancement appears to increase during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> events before returning to baseline suggesting that extent of the disease is probably best judged during the interictal state </plain></SENT>
