<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Subjects with brainstem lesions due to either an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) underwent two types of binaural testing (lateralization testing and interaural discrimination) for three types of sounds (clicks and high and low frequency narrow-band noise) with two kinds of interaural differences (level and time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two major types of abnormalities were revealed in the lateralization performances: perception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stimuli, regardless of interaural differences (time and/or level) in the center of the head (center-oriented), or lateralization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stimuli to one side or the other of the head (side-oriented) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar patterns of abnormal lateralization (center-oriented and side-oriented) occurred for MS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subject's pattern of abnormal lateralization testing was the same regardless of the type of stimulus or type of interaural disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lateralization testing was a more sensitive test than interaural discrimination testing for both types of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning in three orthogonal planes of the brainstem was used to detect lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A semi-automated algorithm superimposed the auditory pathway onto each MRI section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whenever a lesion overlapped the auditory pathway, some binaural performance was abnormal and vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given a lateralization test abnormality, whether the pattern was center-oriented or side-oriented was mainly determined by lesion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Center-oriented performance was principally associated with caudal pontine lesions and side-oriented performance with lesions rostral to the superior olivary complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For lesions restricted to the lateral lemniscus and/or inferior colliculus, whether unilateral or bilateral, just noticeable differences (JNDs) were nearly always abnormal, but for caudal pontine lesions JNDs could be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MS subjects were more sensitive to interaural time delays than interaural level differences particularly for caudal pontine lesions, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients showed no differential sensitivity to the two kinds of interaural differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neural processing of binaural stimuli is multilevel and begins with independent interaural time and level analyzers in the caudal pons </plain></SENT>
