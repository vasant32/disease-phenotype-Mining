<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three had multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>Sporadic</z:hpo> bursts of monocular abducting saccades were recorded in either eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each saccade was followed by a slower return to midposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of the INO prevented conjugate saccades of the fellow eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adducting phases were faster than convergence eye movements or the glissadic smooth eye movements that sometimes follow saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dynamic overshoot of the abducting saccadic phase may contribute to the relatively rapid adducting phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The saccadic intrusions of INO are recognized clinically as monocular horizontal oscillation; low-amplitude intrusions are evident only during funduscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This distinctive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesia</z:hpo> is considered a sign of involvement extrinsic to the medial longitudinal fasciculi in patients with INO </plain></SENT>
