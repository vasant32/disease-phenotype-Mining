<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 70-year-old motorist driving on the wrong side of the road caused a car-to-car head-on collision and died some minutes later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The autopsy revealed a lethal rupture of the right heart ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The insurance company argued that driving on the wrong side was an act of gross negligence so that the damage was not covered by the full comprehensive insurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the microscopic examination of the myocardium performed by a clinical pathologist brought to light a severe myofibrillar degeneration (MFD) which was interpreted as diagnostic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was supposed that this could have caused an incapacity of the driver to control his car, which in turn would commit the insurance to payment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A critical re-evaluation of the heart tissue material, however, revealed the pattern of trauma-induced hypercontraction banding of the myocardium along the cleft edges but no findings suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the accident was not the result of a cardiac attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But there was a severe preexisting pathology including <z:mp ids='MP_0001625'>cardiac hypertrophy</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> of the myocardium, siderophages of the lungs, and an infarction of the pons, so that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> was the most plausible explanation for the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, gross negligence had to be denied, and the insurance company was obliged to pay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This observation points to the existence of two different variants of MFD: Clinical pathologists are familiar with "tyical" MFD occurring in reperfusion after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> toxicity, and around <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> necroses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But hypercontraction banding, regularly found along penetrating heart lesions and well known to forensic pathologists, is uncommon in clinical pathology </plain></SENT>
