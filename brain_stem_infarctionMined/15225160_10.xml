<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the identification of a de novo supernumerary ring chromosome in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo>, long <z:hpo ids='HP_0001182'>tapering fingers</z:hpo>, elongated, thin feet and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ring marker chromosome was found to be mosaic, present in 24% of cells, and was later shown to be derived from chromosome 18, r(18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to define the breakpoints involved in the formation of r(18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 18p breakpoint was localized between the markers WI-9619 and D18S1150, which is less than 10 cM to the centromere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 18q breakpoint was localized between the centromere and BAC clone 666n19, which is a region of less than 40 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the r(18) mostly originated from 18p, with an estimated size of less than 10 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies identify and characterize a new marker chromosome 18, provide insights into the understanding of the relationships between the clinical phenotypes and marker chromosomes, and establish a framework for finding a potential vascular and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> gene located on chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
