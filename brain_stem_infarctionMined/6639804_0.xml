<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiographies were performed on 20 patients, ranging from 6 months to 16 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">H-H-E syndrome</z:e> (4 cases), sequelae of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> (2), sequelae of head trauma (3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> (2) and others (9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Final radiological diagnoses of these cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100556'>hemiatrophy</z:hpo> (14 cases), generalized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (2) and focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Circulation time, caliber of arteries, degree of opacification in cortical and deep veins and early filling of deep veins were investigated on angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Slow circulation of cerebral blood flow was shown in 10 cases and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulation in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial narrowing was observed more frequently in slow circulation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100556'>hemiatrophy</z:hpo>, small caliber of the middle cerebral arteries and slow circulation on the atrophic hemisphere were demonstrated, but no abnormality on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deep veins were prominently opacified in cases which showed poor cortical veins, the other way cortical veins were prominent in cases which showed poor visualization of deep veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cortical veins and deep veins may compensate each other in cerebral venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most cases of slow circulation, dominant opacification of deep veins were visualized and these veins already appeared in arterial phase, but cortical veins had a tendency of poor opacification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These venous drainage patterns are similar to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Causes of these vascular changes are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>But they may play an important role in cerebral atrophic disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
