<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study case was a 66-year-old man who had bilateral neurosensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>hearing impairment</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He noticed mild hearing loss, frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About one month later, his hearing took a sudden turn for the worse, and he suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, dysphagea and abasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed pseudobulber palsy, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, cerebeller <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, disturbance of pain and temperature sensation on the right face and left side of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) showed a delayed small wave V with the abscence of previous waves on the right side and no significant waves on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) revealed infarctions in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, including in the right lateral portions of pons, and the right lower pontine base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that not only peripheral, but also central auditory pathways adjacent to infarctions were damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed severe stenosis or occlusion of left vertebral artery and basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that hypoperfusion of the vertebrobasilar artery territories caused <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the cochlear nerve and the auditory tracts in the brain stem, which resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilateral hearing loss</z:e> </plain></SENT>
