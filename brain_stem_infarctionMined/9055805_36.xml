<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Case Alex, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber Syndrome</z:e> affecting the left hemisphere, failed to develop speech throughout early boyhood, and his comprehension of single words and simple commands remained stagnant at an age equivalent of 3-4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But then, following left hemidecortication at age 8.5 years and withdrawal of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> when he was more than 9 years old, Alex suddenly began to acquire speech and language </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He also showed an unusual degree of residual motor capacity on his right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alex's remarkable progress in learning speech and language, and the development of his other cognitive abilities, were measured periodically from the age of 9 to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His most recent scores on tests of receptive and expressive language place him at an age equivalent of 8-10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison with the level of function attained in these domains by nine other left hemispherectomized patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease and comparable IQ (range, 40-68) but with early development of speech and language, suggests that, surprisingly, Alex has suffered no permanent disadvantage from his protracted period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002300'>mutism</z:hpo> and severely limited comprehension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the findings in Alex, as in other left-hemispherectomized patients, indicate define limits to the cognitive and linguistic capacity of the isolated right hemisphere, Alex's achievements appear to challenge the widely held view that early childhood is a particularly critical period for acquisition of speech and language or any of their selective aspects, including phonology, grammar, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233743" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">prosody</z:e> and semantics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that clearly articulated, well structured, and appropriate language can be acquired for the first time as late as age 9 years with the right hemisphere alone </plain></SENT>
