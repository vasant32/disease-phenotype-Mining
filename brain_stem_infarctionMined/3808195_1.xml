<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Precise operative techniques were also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 47-year-old male was admitted to our hospital on November 9, 1984, because of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT revealed a low density area in the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left vertebral angiogram showed occlusion of the left vertebral artery just distal to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial branch of the left cerebellar hemisphere were filled via the left PICA to the left SCA and anterior inferior cerebellar artery anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Right brachial angiogram showed the hypoplastic right vertebral artery which ended at the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rostral basilar artery, both posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>'s) and right SCA were filled through anastomosis from the right PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The posterior circulation was not filled by either of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In spite of antiplatelet agglutination therapy, the patient had two more episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because of progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, STA-SCA anastomosis was carried out on the right side on February 27, 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During operation, the blood pressure was maintained above the level of 130 mmHg, and intravenous <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> injection and spinal drainage were done to preserve the right temporal lobe from intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> caused by retraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient has been free from new ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>He has only slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> now eight months after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Right external carotid angiogram showed a patent STA-SCA bypass and good filling of SCA's and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>'s bilaterally.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
