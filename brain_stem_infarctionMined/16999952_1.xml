<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infarction perception improvement by data denoising and local contrast enhancement in multi-scale domain was proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The wavelet-based image processing method enhanced the subtlest signs of hypodensity, which were often invisible in standard CT scan review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus improved detection efficiency of perceptual ischemic changes was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data processing became more effective by initial segmentation of brain tissue and extraction of regions susceptible to tissue density changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The new method was experimentally verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosis increased to 56.3% in comparison to 12.5% of standard CT scan preview </plain></SENT>
