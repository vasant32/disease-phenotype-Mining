<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 96 only BSIs patients were categorized into four groups according to HbA1c as &lt;6%, ≥ 6% but &lt;7%, ≥ 7% but &lt;8%, or ≥ 8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of the four HbA1c groups with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes (DIV), National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), and follow-up modified Rankin Scale (FmRS) scores were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients also were categorized into two groups according to HbA1c&lt;6% or ≥ 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between HbA1c and DIV (Spearman ρ=0.339, P=0.001), NIHSS scores (ρ=0.292, P=0.004) and FmRS scores (ρ=0.315, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of pons infarction was highest in BSIs and patients with HbA1c ≥ 6% showed significantly more frequent isolated pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses showed that only HbA1c was independently associated with larger DIV (P=0.025) and FmRS scores (P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that elevated HbA1c level may be a potential serologic marker in the evaluation of the severity and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BSIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to study control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) before and after BSIs </plain></SENT>
