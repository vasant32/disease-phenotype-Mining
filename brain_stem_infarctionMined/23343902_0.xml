<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in somatosensory systems after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or injury could profoundly influence brain computer interfaces being developed to create new output signals from motor cortex activity patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we had the unique opportunity to study the responses of hand/arm area neurons in motor cortex to passive joint manipulation in a person with a longstanding brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but intact sensory pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurons responded to passive manipulation of the contralateral shoulder, elbow or wrist as predicted from prior studies of intact primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, fundamental properties and organization was preserved despite arm/hand <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and damage to cortical outputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same neurons were engaged by imagined arm actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that intact sensory pathways retain the potential to influence motor cortex firing rates years after cortical outputs are interrupted and may contribute to online decoding of motor intentions for BCI applications </plain></SENT>
