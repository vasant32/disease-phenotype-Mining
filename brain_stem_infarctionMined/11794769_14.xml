<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously we demonstrated that templates constructed from trigger averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) can be cross-correlated with ongoing electrocorticograms (ECoGs) to detect ERPs associated with the performance of simple motor actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it was difficult to predict a priori which of many candidate ECoG recording site(s) could provide signals that would provide adequate motor action detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present here a measure of ERP quality based on an estimate of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) associated with the formation of an ERP template from the performance of consecutive voluntary actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detection-theory-based receiver operator characteristics (ROCs) and a database of ECoGs (6000+) recorded from the cortical surface of awake human subjects were used to assess the usefulness of the SNR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNR method was found to predict the detection efficacy of ERPs when characterized over a wide parameter range, with the majority of ROC curve areas greater than 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method was compared with our previously developed quality measure (the peak-to-baseline ratio) and found to provide significantly better performance (ROC area differences from 4.4% to 13.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SNR estimate of the ERP is a useful tool to predict the efficacy of ERP templates for cross-correlation-based detection and assist in the selection of viable ERP templates for DBI applications </plain></SENT>
