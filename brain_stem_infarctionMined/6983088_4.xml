<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because emission tomographic equipment is not yet available at most hospitals, the authors compared <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> brain images obtained with an Anger camera with those obtained by SPECT to determine the usefulness of <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine pairs of studies were performed on 12 control patients, 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and a miscellaneous group of eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Planar scintigraphy showed good correlation with SPECT in determining the presence or absence of abnormality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one with a very <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> stem infarction that was not detected by planar imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anger images showed poor contrast resolution compared with SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is thus expected that SPECT will result in better lesion detection when smaller lesions are studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Planar scintigraphy is not capable of providing quantitative measurement of regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
