<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, MRI indices (rDWI &amp; rADC) deteriorate during the first 3-7 days after the ictus and then gradually normalize in approximately 10 days (pseudonormalization time), although the tissue is already infarcted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since effective treatments improve these indices significantly and in less than the natural pseudonormalization time, a combined analysis of these changes provides an opportunity for objective evaluation on the effectiveness of various treatments for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">Hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> are highly destructive to the tissue and aggravate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavengers (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> and hydrogen) by intravenous administration and evaluated the effects of the treatment by a serial observation and analysis of these MRI indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effects of the treatment were evaluated and compared in two groups, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> alone group and a combined group with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> and hydrogen, in order to assess beneficial effects of addition of hydrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were divided in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> only group (E group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>26 patients) and combined treatment group with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">Edaravone</z:chebi> and hydrogen enriched saline (EH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The extent of the initial hump of rDWI, the initial dip of rADC and pseudo-normalization time were determined in each patient serially and averages of these data were compared in these two groups and also with the natural course in the literatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The initial hump of rDWI reached 2.0 in the E group which was better than 2.5 of the natural course but was not as good as 1.5 of the EH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial dip of rADC was 0.6 in the E group which was close to the natural course but worse than 0.8 of the EH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pseudonormalization time of rDWI and rADC was 9 days only in EH group but longer in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Addition of hydrogen caused no side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavengers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> improved MRI indices against the natural course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effects were more obvious and significant in the EH group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings may imply the need for more frequent daily administration of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="29191">hydroxyl</z:chebi> scavenger, or possible additional hydrogen effects on scavenger mechanisms </plain></SENT>
