<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of these progressive lesions are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aberrant expression of angiogenic factors has been implicated in the genesis and maintenance of vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in SWS vascular lesions we determined the expression of key angiogenic factors by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in 8 SWS patients (age: 8 months to 18 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its cognate receptors VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin (NP)-1 as well as Tie2 in leptomeningeal SWS blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, these factors are known to be transcriptionally induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The HIF system has emerged as the key regulatory system of responses to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated markedly elevated nuclear HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha protein levels in SWS vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, SWS vessels revealed signs of enhanced endothelial cell (EC) turnover as evidenced by increased EC proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, in terms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, vascular malformations in SWS are not static lesions but constitute dynamic structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our observation of a dysregulated HIF-alpha expression in SWS vessels are in agreement with recent findings that EC-specific HIF activation provides a setting which supports and sustains <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and could be of potential use for developing therapeutic strategies to treat these currently incurable lesions </plain></SENT>
