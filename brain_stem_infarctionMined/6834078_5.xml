<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the normo- and hypertensive controls and patients with hemisphere infarction displayed a conspicuous decrease (about 40%) in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (NA) urinary excretion after head down tilting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> increased NA urinary excretion after the manoeuvre, suggesting activation instead of deactivation of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (SNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In normo- and hypertensive controls the values of night NA excretion were lower than those of day NA excretion, whereas in brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients the night NA excretion was close to the day NA excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding also supports the view that the brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients are not able to deactivate their SNS during night recumbency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SNS reactivity disorder of such patients if associated with impairment of autoregulation of cerebral circulation might generate an abnormal increase in cerebral circulation during night recumbency </plain></SENT>
