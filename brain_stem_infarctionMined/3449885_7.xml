<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 75 consecutive cases of spontaneous cerebellar haemorrhage was undertaken in order to evaluate the clinical features and natural history of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A wide spectrum of clinical findings contributed to the poor clinical diagnostic accuracy of 23 per cent, with common misdiagnoses including brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vestibular or labyrinthine disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presentation with, or the later development of stupor or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> strongly correlated with poor outcome (severe disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of conscious patients who remained stable were compared with those who subsequently deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial conscious state (alert, drowsy or confused), severity of symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, and the size of haemorrhage on CT scan were not reliable prognostic indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of bilateral gaze <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002425'>anarthria</z:hpo> (present in eight cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo>, a systolic blood pressure above 200 mmHg and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> significantly correlated with a poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of these signs warrants consideration of urgent surgical intervention at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since no clinical or radiological findings excluded the possibility of further deterioration, careful monitoring in an intensive care unit is necessary within the first 48 h in those conscious patients who are likely to remain stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for making the clinical diagnosis and for selecting those patients who will require transfer to adequately equipped centres are suggested </plain></SENT>
