<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>MRI including diffusion-weighted sequences (DW-MRI) has demonstrated its high sensitivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> supratentorial ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we examined the sensitivity of different MRI sequences for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brainstem and isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion- and T2-weighted MRI of 45 consecutive patients with signs and symptoms of infratentorial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> between 6/1997 and 1/2000 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and the first MRI varied between 2 hours to 7 days with a median of 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI repeats were performed in 4 patients in whom the clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> had not been detected initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesion detectability and size were evaluated for different brainstem and thalamic localizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brainstem or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> as defined by the clinical condition could be identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by comparison of DW-MRI and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pons in farctions were the largest, followed by midbrain and thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medulla oblongata infarctions were small in comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pons, mid-brain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarctions</z:e> were reliably identified beginning 12 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, detectability of medulla oblongata infarctions varied within the first 24 hours and their overall visibility was worse than that of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> corresponding to their small size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, regardless of loca tion, none of the 3 infarctions examined within the first 5 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These lesions were demonstrated in follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pontine, midbrain and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarctions</z:e> can reliably be visualized by a combination of DW-MRI and T2-weighted images beginning 12 hours after the ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, sensitivity seems to be lower earlier than 12 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and for medulla oblongata lesions </plain></SENT>
