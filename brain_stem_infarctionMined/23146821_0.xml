<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background: Our clinical experience suggests that the outcome of cerebellum-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> is better than that of hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods: Within the setting of 2 national Israeli prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> surveys, we analyzed risk factors, etiology, severity at presentation, and prognosis of first ischemic cerebellum-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (259 patients), comparing with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> within the anterior circulation (1,029 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: Patients with cerebellum-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were younger and had less frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic etiology was significantly less prevalent (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity at presentation was milder (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At discharge, worsening of the modified Rankin Scale was present in a smaller number of patients (p &lt; 0.001); more returned to their home (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six-month and 1-year mortality were lower (p &lt; 0.001 for both) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted logistic regression models showed that patients with cerebellum-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had 50% smaller chances of dying (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.31-0.98) and a smaller chance of worsening of the modified Rankin Scale at discharge (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46-0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: Cerebellum-brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are less frequently cardioembolic, have a less severe presentation, and carry a better immediate and long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
