<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, no studies have examined the efficacy of this intervention in people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 13-year-old girl who had a cerebellar/brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 16 months before the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her long-term goal was to walk independently in her home with a walker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Locomotor training using a BWS system both on the treadmill and during overground walking was implemented 5 days a week for 4 weeks in a clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Locomotor training using BWS on a treadmill was continued 5 days a week for 4 months at home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOMES: Prior to training, she was able to take steps on her own with the help of another person, but did not take full weight on her feet or walk on a regular basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, she walked for household distances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to training, her Pediatric Functional Independence Measure scores were 3 (moderate assistance) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> transfers, 2 (maximal assistance) for walking, and 1 (total assistance) for stairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, her scores were 6 (modified independence) for transfers, 5 (supervision) for walking, and 4 (minimal assistance) for stairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior to training, she was unable to take independent steps during treadmill walking; at 6 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of her steps were unassisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Locomotor training using BWS on a treadmill in conjunction with overground gait training may be an effective way to improve ambulatory function in individuals with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, but the intensity and duration of training required for functionally significant improvements may be prolonged </plain></SENT>
