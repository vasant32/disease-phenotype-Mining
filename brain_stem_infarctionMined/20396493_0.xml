<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the false-negative rate of DWI in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We applied DWI to 26 patients with a clinical diagnosis of lateral medullary infarction within 72 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed relationships between initial DWI findings and time-to-MRI (the time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and initial DWI), number of clinical symptoms and signs, and final lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 8 cases (31%) of false negatives in the initial DWI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of false-negative DWI findings decreased significantly as the time-to-MRI increased (P=0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the false-negative rate was not significantly correlated with the number of clinical symptoms and signs or the final lesion volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of lateral medullary infarction should not be ruled out on the basis of early negative DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To confirm the lesion, follow-up DWI or further MRI should be performed in cases with early negative DWI results </plain></SENT>
