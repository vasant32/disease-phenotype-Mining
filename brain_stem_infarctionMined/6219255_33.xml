<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1, 1952, through Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>31, 1972 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we have seen 38 additional patients during the 8 1/2-year period from Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1, 1973, through June 1981 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The series includes three patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> who had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004952'>pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> removed at two separate thoracotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our report also includes a brief description of five additional patients with acquired systemic artery-to-pulmonary artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> who underwent miniballoon occlusion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We are including these five cases because we believe this therapeutic catheterization technique may be of particular value in patients with multiple or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0006548'>pulmonary arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and may obviate extensive pulmonary resection and repeat thoracotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> is believed to occur most often in middle-aged women who have associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e>, but most of our patients did not have hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A logical workup of a patient with pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> includes, in sequential fashion based on priority, chest roentgenography and tomography, arterial blood gas measurements, contrast echocardiography with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> dye, angiography, and measurement of differential pulmonary venous oxygen content </plain></SENT>
