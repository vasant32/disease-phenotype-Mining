<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have performed a retrospective study of seven patients with confirmed SWS (age 7 days to 3 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the patients was asymptomatic at the time of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> underwent MRI (T1 and T2 sequences) and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow was measured using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, myelination appeared to be accelerated in the areas underlying the leptomeningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> on both MRI sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five cases, SPECT showed hyperperfusion in the damaged hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case, the SPECT was symmetrical and in another it showed hypoperfusion in the damaged hemisphere which was already atrophied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the accelerated myelination is not related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but to transient hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This MRI pattern can be helpful for the early diagnosis of SWS, which is of utmost importance for preventive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
