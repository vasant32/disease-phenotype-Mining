<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in pure, unilateral medullary infarction using video fluoroscopic swallowing (VFS) tests and to compare the results between lateral medullary infarction (LMI) and medial medullary infarction (MMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 46 patients with medullary infarction (37 LMI, 9 MMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the MRI findings, each LMI was classified rostrocaudally as either a rostral or caudal lesion, and horizontally as either a superficial (lateral + dorsal) or nonsuperficial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each MMI was assigned to either a deep (lesion extending to the dorsal surface) or superficial lesion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VFS examination was conducted and an 8-point scale was used for assessing the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was classified as: 1) problems on timing of hyolaryngeal excursion (PT), and 2) problems on range of hyolaryngeal excursion (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> was more frequent (p &lt; 0.05) in MMI patients (78%) than in LMI patients (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the LMI patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was more frequent (p &lt; 0.01) and severe (p &lt; 0.01) in the rostral than in the caudal group and in the nonsuperficial than in the superficial group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the MMI group, there was no difference in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> between the deep and superficial groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, seven (54%) of the LMI patients had PR, five (38%) had PT, and one (8%) had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the MMI patients, PT was frequent (86%) but PR was present in only one patient (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five MMI patients (71%) showed no responses to penetration or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, and silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was observed in only four LMI patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> is as frequent and severe in medial medullary infarction (MMI) as in lateral medullary infarction (LMI) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The types and characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> are different between the LMI and MMI patients, implicating the rationale for a different treatment strategy </plain></SENT>
