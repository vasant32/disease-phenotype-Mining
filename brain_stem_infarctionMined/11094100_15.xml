<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss the indications and timing for resective surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> and medication-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SWS that causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> severe enough to merit surgery is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the variable natural history of the disease, it is difficult to establish clear-cut indications for surgery and prospective studies are not feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Attitudes of clinicians and surgeons remain variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors assessed the presurgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> profile, criteria for surgery, monitoring techniques, and the postoperative outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with SWS consecutively admitted between 1972 and 1990 to two referral centers (Paris and Montreal) and underwent surgery for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients had a minimal postoperative follow-up of 4 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one are still followed by one of the authors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had a callosotomy, five underwent hemispherectomy, and 14 had cortical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite variability in the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (range: 2 months to 12 years), age at operation (range: 8 months to 34 years) and surgical methods, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients benefited from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Visually guided complete resection of the pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> and underlying cortex, whenever possible, seemed sufficient; results were no better with intraoperative corticography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In children with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, hemispherectomy proved particularly effective: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed any aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> following surgery; none of those who were operated on early presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010864'>severe mental retardation</z:hpo>, and 13 of 20 became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the natural history of SWS is imperfectly known, increasing duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and of postictal deficits, increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or of calcified lesions or both, are indicative of its progressive nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> that renders formal comparison of the various approaches difficult, the current study provides new evidence to support early surgery in patients with SWS and drug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The authors' results suggest that lesionectomy is a good approach, provided that the pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> is unilateral and the resection can be complete </plain></SENT>
