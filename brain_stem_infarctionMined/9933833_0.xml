<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine whether there is a gender difference in the need for urodynamics in the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 72 consecutive post-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> patients with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> documented by the patients or the persons who looked after them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated between 4 and 6 weeks after their <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had negative urine cultures and a postvoid residual urine determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1410927" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">narrow angle</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, postvoid residual urine greater than 100 cm3 and radiographic evidence for a brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This left 30 male (mean age 65) and 30 female (mean age 67) patients evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were empirically started on anticholinergic medications and timed voids for 4 weeks after which cytoscopy and cystometry were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 28/30 females (93%) reported subjective improvement in their continence with conservative measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>1 (3%) was found to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0008722'>urethral diverticulum</z:hpo>, and 1 (3%) had uninhibited detrusor contractions that did not improve with medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the male group, 20/30 (67%) reported subjective improvement, 5 (17%) developed elevated postvoid residual urine volumes, 3 (10%) were diagnosed with urethral strictures, 1 (3%) had a bladder neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contracture</z:hpo>, and 1 (3%) had transitional cell <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ in the bladder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the patient with new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> in the initial period after <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, an empiric trial of anticholinergic medications and timed voiding may be warranted in a select population of female patients without urodynamic testing or cystoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This conservative approach may not be appropriate in males because of their increased likelihood of having secondary urologic conditions </plain></SENT>
