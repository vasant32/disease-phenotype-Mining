<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To develop an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging method that improves detection of leptomeningeal disease when compared with the current reference standard, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the cases of 10 children who were at high risk of intracranial leptomeningeal disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> were investigated by using one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examination, and the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> were investigated by using four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations performed over 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images were acquired in addition to the routine sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parameters of the FLAIR sequence were chosen to maximize the T1 component of the signal intensity, to maximize detection of leptomeningeal enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We made subjective and objective assessments of the presence and extent of leptomeningeal disease as shown on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and contrast-enhanced FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In three of the four cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, the T1 and FLAIR sequences showed comparable extent of leptomeningeal enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For one child, FLAIR images showed unexpected bilateral disease and more extensive leptomeningeal enhancement on the clinically suspected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four of six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo>, no leptomeningeal enhancement was shown on any examinations during the 18-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases, FLAIR images showed more extensive leptomeningeal enhancement when compared with T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging seems to improve detection of leptomeningeal disease when compared with routine contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This seems to be partly because of suppression of signal intensity from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular structures on the surface of the brain by FLAIR, which allows easier visualization of abnormal leptomeninges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We think that these findings can be extrapolated to the investigation of leptomeningeal disease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> causes and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
