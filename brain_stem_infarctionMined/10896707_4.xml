<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C-FP occurred more often in patients with lesions of the lower pons or upper medulla of the ventromedial brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some patients with dorsolateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the upper medulla to the lower pons showed C-FP, mostly on the lesion side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-FP on the side of the lesion was also seen in patients with dorsolateral involvement of the lower pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with ventromedial infarction of the brain stem showed <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of extremities contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific neurological symptoms and signs such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, and contralateral superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> were seen in patients with dorsolateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesised that the facial CBT descends at the ventromedial lower pons, near the corticospinal tract, mainly to the level of the upper medulla, where the fibres then decussate and ascend in the dorsolateral medulla to synapse in the contralateral facial nucleus </plain></SENT>
