<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We employed isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ-8plex)-based liquid chromatography interfaced with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach to identify differentially expressed proteins between port-wine-derived and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin-derived fibroblasts of four individuals with SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Proteins were identified that were significantly up- or down-regulated (i.e., ratios &gt;1.2 or &lt;0.8) in two or three pairs of samples (n = 31/972 quantified proteins) and their associated p values reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ingenuity pathway analysis (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi>) tool showed that the up-regulated proteins were associated with pathways that enhance cell proliferation; down-regulated proteins were associated with suppression of cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significant toxicologic list pathway in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four observations was <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> mediated by Nrf2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This proteomics study highlights <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> also consistent with a possible mutation in the RASA1 gene or pathway in SWS </plain></SENT>
