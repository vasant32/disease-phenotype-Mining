<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>S-100 protein and neurone specific enolase were serially quantified in peripheral blood at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (hours 4, 8, 10, 24 and 72 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whereas S-100 protein was detected in none of the matched control subjects. this protein was observed in 17/24 of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with detectable S-100 protein had significantly larger infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarctions had already significantly increased S-100 concentrations at days 1 and 3 compared to subcortical or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with volumes of brain lesion of &gt;5 ccm exhibited significantly increased serum levels of S-100 at hours 10, 24 and 72 compared to those with lesion volumes of &lt;5 ccm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At hours 10, 24 and 72, concentrations of S-100 correlated with scores of neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although kinetics of release of neurone specific enolase showed a similar pattern of release in blood, no significant association to outcome or extent of brain damage was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that S-100 protein and not NSE may represent a useful serum marker of brain damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
