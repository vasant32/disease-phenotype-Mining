<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>Epistaxis</z:hpo>, due to rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> of the nasal mucosa, is the most frequent clinical manifestation, leading in many cases to severe impairment of the quality of life in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Though several treatments have been used to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, none have been completely effective, with the exception of polydocanol (AethoxysklerolÂ®) in submucosal or subpericondrial injections, which was first presented in 2000 with very good results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After fifteen years using polydocanol in submucosal injections on 45 patients and with nearly 300 injections, we have observed that in 95% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, their nose bleeds improved with respect to frequency and quantity without any important side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was just one case of septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, another with increased septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, and one patient who suffered from dizziness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> for a few minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this paper the results obtained using this technique over a fifteen-year period will be presented and evaluated </plain></SENT>
