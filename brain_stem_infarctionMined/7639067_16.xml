<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in particular, they may be responsible for the partially deleterious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is little knowledge of the central organization of sympathetic pathways above the brainstem level for both cardio-efferent and sudomotor fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the sympathetic skin response (SSR) in 29 patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in order to evaluate the pathways mediating emotional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 24 patients (82.8%) the SSR was pathological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were bilateral with no clear asymmetry in 10 patients (34.5%), bilateral with marked contralateral pathology in 8 patients (27.6%), purely contralateral in 5 patients (17.2%) and purely ipsilateral in one patient (3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral abnormalities were more frequent and more marked in brainstem than in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is probably indicative of a more generalized sympathetic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, contralateral abnormalities were more pronounced in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> than in brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results show that sympathetic skin responses are suppressed in the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric responses may indicate that sudomotor fibers mediating emotional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> have their origin or receive input from the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
