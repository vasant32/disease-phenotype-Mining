<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of cases are caused by basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> in the ventral pons, yet numerous other etiologies have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of LIS is completely dependent on the physician's ability to know that these manifestations originate in the brainstem and the posterior circulation that supplies it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This knowledge hinges on the ability of the examining physician to conduct a rapid, yet appropriately thorough neurologic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With recent advances in interventional neuroradiology leading to improved patient outcomes, LIS has evolved into a critical, time-dependent diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Herein, we present the case of a male patient who initially presented to the emergency department of a community hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By presenting this case and focusing on the importance of the occulomotor exam, we hope to help in the rapid identification and treatment of patients with LIS in the emergency room and avoid outcomes similar to that of our patient </plain></SENT>
