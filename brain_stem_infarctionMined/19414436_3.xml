<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The diameters of the vertebral arteries (VAs) are very often unequal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study investigated if unequal VA flow contributes to the development of basilar artery (BA) curvature and if it is a link to the laterality of pontine or cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> occurring around the vertebrobasilar junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Radiological factors were analysed (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> laterality, VA dominance, BA curvature and their directional relationships) in 91 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral pontine or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The "dominant" VA side was defined as either that the VA was larger in diameter or the VA was connected with the BA in more of a straight line, if both VAs looked similar in diameter on CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict moderate to severe BA curvature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dominant VA was more frequent on the left side (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most patients had an opposite directional relationship between the dominant VA and BA curvature (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were opposite to the side of BA curvature (p&lt;0.01) and PICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were on the same side as the non-dominant VA side (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in VA diameters was the single independent predictor for moderate to severe BA curvature (OR per 1 mm, 2.70; 95% CI 1.22 to 5.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unequal VA flow is an important haemodynamic contributor of BA curvature and development of peri-vertebrobasilar junctional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
