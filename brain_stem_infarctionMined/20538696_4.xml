<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pontine infarction is most often related to basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> when the lesion abuts on the basal surface (paramedian pontine infarction), whereas small medial pontine lesion is usually attributed to small vessel lipohyalinosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A previous study has found that high-resolution MRI can detect basilar atherosclerotic plaques in up to 70% of patient with paramedian pontine infarction, even in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiograms, but none has evaluated the presence of basilar artery plaque by high-resolution MRI in patients with small medial pontine lesion in the medial part of the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with pontine infarction underwent basilar angiography using time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced 3-dimensional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography to assess the presence of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and high-resolution MRI to assess the presence of atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery angiogram was scored as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>," "irregular," or "stenosed" &gt;or=30%" and basilar artery by high-resolution MRI was scored as "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" or "presence of plaque." Medial pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were divided into paramedian pontine infarction and small medial pontine lesion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one patients with pontine infarction were included, 26 with paramedian pontine infarction and 15 with small medial pontine lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution MRI detected basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 42% of patients with a pontine infarction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients with paramedian pontine infarction, 65% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar angiograms but 77% had basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> detected on high-resolution MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with small medial pontine lesion, 46% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basilar angiograms but 73% had basilar artery plaques detected on by high-resolution MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that medial pontine lacunes may be due to a penetrating artery disease secondary to basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-resolution MRI could help precise <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtyping </plain></SENT>
