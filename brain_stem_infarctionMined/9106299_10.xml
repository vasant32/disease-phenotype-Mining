<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT), MRI and CT in nine children under the age of 4 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> as part of SWS, in an attempt to determine the optimal method of imaging in different clinical settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven unilateral and two bilateral cases were studied by interictal 99mtechnetium hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (HMPAO) SPECT, and contrast-enhanced CT and MRI, giving information on 11 abnormal hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> imaging modalities showed abnormalities in every child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion imaging showed focal regions of decreased uptake in 9 of 11 (82%) abnormal hemispheres and demonstrated a widespread decrease but no focal defect in 2; it also revealed crossed cerebellar diaschisis in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT demonstrated typical gyriform calcification in 9 of 11 (82%) affected hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced MRI showed more extensive involvement than contrast-enhanced CT in 5 of 11 (45%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area of hypoperfusion shown by SPECT was smaller than the area of contrast enhancement on MRI in 6 of 11 cases (55%), comparable in 3 (27%) and larger in 2 cases (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT is sufficient to confirm the clinical diagnosis of SWS, but MRI frequently shows more extensive abnormal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>99mTc HMPAO imaging is a useful addition when it is important to know the full extent of the disease, for example prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely to detect areas of hypoperfusion, representing ischaemic regions, which may act as an epileptogenic focus and may not be shown by CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
