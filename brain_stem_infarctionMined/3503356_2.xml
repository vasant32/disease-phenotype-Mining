<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In contrast to CT, NMR imaging revealed a high percentage of abnormalities in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> population studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The various patterns of abnormalities identified should provide further insight into the pathophysiology of ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> appeared to be the most significant clinical risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although periventricular hypodensities have been visualized by CT for many years, their clinical significance has only recently been appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NMR shows the same periventricular changes as increased signal (long T2), but shows it in a more dramatic fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These periventricular abnormalities, seen both by CT and NMR, have been shown in some cases to be compatible with the pathologic diagnosis of SAE, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Watershed abnormalities both with and without corresponding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> have been presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At present, this appears to be a ubiquitous group of cerebrovascular disease with multiple underlying causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NMR is superior to CT for demonstrating watershed infarctions, not only because it reveals ones missed by CT, but also because it shows a fuller extent of involvement than does CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> as seen by CT and NMR has been presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>NMR demonstrates abnormalities earlier than CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The region of infarction appears more extensive than by CT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarctions show an associated rim of prolonged T2 that may correspond to the ischemic penumbra or regions of ischemic demyelinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CT phenomena, such as fogging and GME, have their NMR correlates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>To date, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of GME shown by CT have also been demonstrated by NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarctions, thought in many instances to be due to emboli have been frequently demonstrated by NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NMR imaging is clearly superior to CT for recognizing these lesions because it is not hampered by artifact from bone adjacent to cortex, as is CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Similarly, posterior fossa and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> may be seen to advantage by NMR </plain></SENT>
