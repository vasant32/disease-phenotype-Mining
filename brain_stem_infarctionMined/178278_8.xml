<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying factor is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e> of the deep veins: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath>, atresia or compression by fibrovascular bands of the popliteal, femoral or iliac veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these 588 patients, 6 children between 15 months and 4 years of age had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these children died from massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of the rectum with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another boy was saved by rectal resection and the last one by subtotal cystectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The important venogram shows an absence of the anterior venous pathway (superficial femoral vein) compensated by the abnormal development of 2 venous groups, the vein of the sciatic nerve and large veins along the external aspect of the inferior limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These 2 venous groups penetrate into the pelvis by the sciatic and gluteal notches and terminate in the internal iliac vein which becomes enormous and has a very high flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This overflow hinders drainage of the venous collateral from the rectum, the bladder and the vagina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The retro adductor vein, prolongated by the deep femoral vein, represents an anastomosis between the sciatic nerve vein and the common femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The surgeon must try to widen this pathway </plain></SENT>
