<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By location, there were 61 deep cerebral, eight midbrain, 23 pontine, and eight medullary infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age of the infarctions ranged from 1 day to 3 1/2 years, with 22% of the patients scanned within 4 days and 43% scanned within 2 weeks of clinical ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities on T2-weighted images were encountered in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mass effect was seen in 10 infarctions, most commonly noted between days 2 and 6, but persisting to day 20 in a single case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal contrast enhancement was seen in 43 cases, occurring predominately between days 2 and 80 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravascular enhancement within the vertebral or basilar arteries was noted in five cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> imaged during the first week following ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meningeal enhancement adjacent to the infarction was not seen in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> contrast enhancement of brainstem and deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> typically occurs over a period from about 3 days to 3 months following ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lack of both parenchymal and intravascular enhancement is thus to be expected for several days after a brainstem or deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
