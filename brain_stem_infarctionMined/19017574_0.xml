<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be associated with a variety of symptoms including severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients often become symptomatic during childhood and the severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> correlates with the patient's neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient reported here remained asymptomatic until age 24, when he started to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> accompanied by visual <z:hpo ids='HP_0000575'>scotoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten years later, he developed severe, refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, with prolonged postictal neurological deficits and ictal as well as post-ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It became increasingly difficult to distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> as both could last for several hours, as demonstrated in the two video EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> may therefore have contributed to the patient's severe, neurological deterioration, probably by accelerating the progressive neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgery improved the situation, but lesional areas were too extensive for complete removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>Late-onset</z:hpo> symptoms in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> may thus result in a severe course for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early intervention and surgical treatment options are discussed </plain></SENT>
