<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The existence of a prenuclear abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> is still debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective design, we identified 22 patients with isolated unilateral (n = 20) or bilateral (n = 2) abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> and electrophysiologic abnormalities indicating rostral pontine and/or mesencephalic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 11 patients had unilateral abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> with additional ocular motor abnormalities indicating midbrain dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of these 11 patients also had electrophysiological abnormalities supporting this location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological examinations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients included masseter and blink reflexes (MassR, BlinkR), brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), and direct current elctro-oculography (EOG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Unilateral MassR abnormalities in patients with unilateral abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> were seen in 17 patients and were almost always (in 16 of 17 patients) on the side of the abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another 11 patients had bilateral MassR abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BlinkR was always <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EOG disclosed slowed abduction saccades in the non-paretic eye in 6 patients and slowed saccades to the side opposite to the abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> in another 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Re-examinations were done in 27 patients showing normalization or improvement of masseter reflex abnormalities in 18 of 20 patients and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with EOG abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was always associated with clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiologically documented or clinically evident rostral pontine and/or mesencephalic lesions in our patients exclude an infranuclear intrapontine 6th <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0847483" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve lesion</z:e> and indicate the existence of an abduction <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of prenuclear origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An increased tone of the antagonistic medial rectus muscle during lateral gaze either by abnormal convergence or impaired medial rectus inhibition seems most likely </plain></SENT>
