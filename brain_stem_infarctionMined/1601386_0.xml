<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Further, the vasomotor reactivity of the basilar artery was measured in 48 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebro-basilar ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with the findings in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasomotor reactivity was significantly reduced in patients with stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with high degree ICA stenoses, undergoing to carotid surgery, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-test showed a significant improvement of the pathological vasomotor reactivity 6 month after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebro-basilar ischemia</z:e>, the vasomotor reactivity measured in the basilar artery, was significantly reduced in patients with completed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> but not in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751022" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient brainstem ischemia</z:e> or infarctions in the posterior cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that evaluation of the cerebral vasomotor reactivity by transcranial Doppler ultrasound is able to identify an inadequate cerebral blood supply and may help to estimate the hemodynamic effect of stenosis or occlusion of the extracranial brain supplying arteries </plain></SENT>
