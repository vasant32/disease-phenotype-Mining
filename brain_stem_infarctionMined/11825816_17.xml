<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the efficacy and complications of diode laser cyclophotocoagulation (cyclodiode) in the management of refractory pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Noncomparative interventional case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Pediatric patients with uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven eyes of 61 patients underwent cyclodiode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 7.4 years (range, 0.4-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnoses included aphakic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo>, juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007700'>anterior segment dysgenesis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of eyes were aphakic, and 64% had undergone at least one previous surgical procedure for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent a mean of 2.3 treatment sessions per eye (maximum, 8 sessions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean pretreatment IOP was 32.0 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After one treatment session, 62% had a clinically useful reduction in IOP (&lt;22 mmHg or by 30%), but this had fallen to 37% by 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With repeat cyclodiode, 72% had a clinically useful reduction in IOP for a year or more (mean, 8.4-month interval between treatments) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Aphakic eyes had a more sustained IOP reduction (P &lt; 0.01 log rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of treatment failures, 13% had no useful IOP response, and three eyes developed subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No other eyes lost vision because of cyclodiode-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 5.5% of the treatment sessions there was a significant posttreatment inflammatory episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cyclodiode treatment did not enable a reduction in the number of medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With repeated treatment, cyclodiode can provide effective control of IOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the success rate is lower than with adults, and younger eyes may recover from treatment more rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although response may be temporary, cyclodiode has a lower rate of severe adverse effects than surgical modalities and has roles as a temporizing measure, as an adjunct to surgery, or in managing selected patients in whom surgery is undesirable because of a high risk of surgical complications </plain></SENT>
