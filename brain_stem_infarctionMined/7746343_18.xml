<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the pathogenesis and subsequent cellular biologic behaviour of human cerebral vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Innovative therapeutic strategies will depend on more fundamental understanding of structural and functional lesion biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have freeze-processed four specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>), two cavernous malformations (CM), and resected cortex from one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> (SWD) for immunohistochemical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probes of vascular maturity and cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> were examined, including Factor 8 related antigen (F8RAG), laminin, fibronectin, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules VCAM, ELAM and ICAM-1 (CD 54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sections of the same lesions were permanently fixed and stained using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Haematoxylin</z:chebi> and Eosin, and MOVAT Pentachrome stain for identification of vascular wall structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A double antibody staining battery was utilized with ultraviolet fluorescent microscopy, and was analysed by an observer blinded to the antibody and lesion type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> malformations showed strong expression on their <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> endothelial surface for F8RAG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no expression of ELAM in any lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> expressed VCAM on the endothelial surface of some vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICAM-1 was expressed faintly within two <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CMs expressed fibronectin within the endothelium and subendothelial matrix, and both lesions were devoid of laminin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and the SWD vessels stained for laminin, while none of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> expressed fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These preliminary observations are consistent with the hypothesis that <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and SWD represent more mature vessels, consistent with possible lesion genesis during early phases of embryonic vascular development (dysvasculogenesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CMs represent immature vessels devoid of laminin and other features of mature vessels, consistent with ongoing dysangiogenesis within a fibronectin rich matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be aimed at better elucidation of these biologic probes, and correlation with specific lesion behaviour </plain></SENT>
