<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of CT angiography in case of clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> for the therapeutic management of catheter-based local thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 3 patients (2 males, 1 female) suffering from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of brainstem symptoms and being suspicious of an occluded basilar artery were included into this report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1 patient underwent selective vertebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 patients were initially examined with CT angiography using a 4-row scanner and 100 ml intravenous contrast agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In one patient, an occlusion of the basilar artery was excluded with catheter-based angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the patient was treated with systemic thrombolysis using r-tPA because of a thalamus infarction seen in MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2 patients who have been initially examined with CT angiography presented with complete occlusions of the basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent r-tPA thrombolysis by means of superselective micro-catheter approaches of the vertebrobasilar vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT angiography was very useful for determinating the occlusion length of the basilar artery pre-therapeutically, and in 1 case for ruling out an occluded vertrebral artery for catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered well under thrombolytic therapy applied systemically or selectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral multi-slice CT angiography is a fast and save technique for detecting or ruling out an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, in cases of equivocal clinical signs CT angiography is recommended before the decision of thrombolytic therapy is made </plain></SENT>
