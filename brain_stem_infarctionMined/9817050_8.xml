<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical results of embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006548'>pulmonary arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp>) in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients in the county of Fyn, Denmark, were treated with transcatheter embolization of 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> using 12 detachable <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> balloons and 26 steel coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> were completely occluded and we observed a significant rise in PaO2 after treatment and a significant decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> estimated by contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced an improved functional level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002102'>pleurisy</z:hpo> and another a rise in temperature following treatment, but otherwise no symptomatic complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Embolotherapy is a definitive treatment for <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp>: it is very effective with a high success rate and few complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with HHT are at risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVM</z:mp> and should be screened and treated for <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp> when these reach a size that is associated with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0010480'>PAVMs</z:mp>, contrast echocardiography is a very sensitive method, and follow-up of these patients can be done with contrast echocardiography </plain></SENT>
