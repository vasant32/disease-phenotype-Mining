<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of basilar artery (BA) vasospasm on brainstem (BS) perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) following aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) underwent cerebral angiography prior to decision-making concerning endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BA diameter was compared with baseline angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional brainstem (BS) cerebral blood flow (CBF) was qualitatively estimated by (99m)Tc ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>-SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Delayed BS hypoperfusion was found in 22 (48.9%) of 45 patients and BA narrowing of more than 20% was found in 23 (51.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 23 (73.9%) patients with BA narrowing of more than 20% experienced BS hypoperfusion compared to 6 of 22 (27.3%) patients with minimal or no narrowing (p = 0.0072) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe and moderate BS hypoperfusion had higher degree of BA narrowing compared to patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BS perfusion and mild BS hypoperfusion (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three-month outcome of patients n-22) with BS hypoperfusion was significantly worse compared to patients (n-23) with unimpaired (p = 0.0377, odd ratio for poor outcome 4, 1.15-13.9 95% confidence interval) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the incidence of BA vasospasm in patients with severe symptomatic vasospasm is high and patients with significant BA vasospasm are at higher risk to experience BS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies should be done to evaluate the effects of endovascular therapy on BS perfusion and the impact of BS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on morbidity and mortality of patients with severe symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
