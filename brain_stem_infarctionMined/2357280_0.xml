<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of exposure still remains the limiting factor in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the 9-year period from January 1980 to October 1989, 8 vertebro-PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have been treated microsurgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 2 underwent a pure suboccipital approach while 6 underwent a midline suboccipital approach with deliberate removal of the arch of the atlas in the park bench position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients did well and regained full activities while one patient died from complications related to vasospasm with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient developed symptomatic obstructive dilation of the fourth ventricle requiring ventriculo-cisternostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors recommend the midline suboccipital approach with deliberate C1-laminectomy in ventrolateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decubitus</z:e> for vertebro-PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main advantages are: constant access to the proximal vertebral artery, less medullary retraction in ventrally located <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, improved exposure of the laterobulbar cisterns and the lateromedullary and tonsillar segments of the PICA, thus facilitating dissection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
