<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Being associated with cerebropathology, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, it is well studied in cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have now analyzed the susceptibility of rat brain stem to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-like depolarization (HSD), which could critically interfere with cardiorespiratory control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rat brain stem slices, severe <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (oxygen withdrawal) triggered HSD within minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sudden extracellular DC potential shift of approximately -20 mV showed the typical profile known from other brain regions and was accompanied by an intrinsic optical signal (IOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spatiotemporal IOS analysis revealed that in infant brain stem, HSD was preferably ignited within the spinal trigeminal nucleus and then mostly spread out medially, invading the hypoglossal nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and the ventral respiratory group (VRG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The neuronal hypoxic depolarizations underlying the generation of HSD were massive, but incomplete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The propagation velocity of HSD and the associated extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> rise were also less marked than in other brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In adult brain stem, HSD was mostly confined to the NTS and its occurrence was facilitated by hypotonic solutions, but not by glial poisoning or block of GABAergic and glycinergic synapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, brain stem tissue reliably generates propagating HSD episodes, which may be of interest for basilar-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The preferred occurrence of HSD in the infant brain stem and its propagation into the VRG may be of importance for neonatal brain stem pathology such as sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
