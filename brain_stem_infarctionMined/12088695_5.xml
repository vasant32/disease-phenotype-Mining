<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to assess the extent of functional involvement of the affected hemisphere in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> in comparison with the uninvolved hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To this end beta activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) was measured, both before and after administration of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> intravenously (i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 9 patients asymmetry in beta band activity was studied before and after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several beta bands and asymmetry parameters were calculated. beta band asymmetries were compared with structural abnormalities (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total beta activity was reduced in the involved hemisphere in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients functional abnormalities were found in brain regions that were structurally intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Decreased <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>-enhanced beta activity in the EEG is a sensitive criterion of functional abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with subtle structural abnormalities <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>-enhanced EEG may have added value in diagnosing functional involvement and in monitoring disease progression in patients </plain></SENT>
