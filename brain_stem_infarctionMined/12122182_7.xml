<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes a series of seven consecutive patients referred to a neurological rehabilitation unit with lesions limited to brain stem structures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were shown to exhibit deficits in at least one domain of cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The practical importance of recognising <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in this group of patients, and the theoretical significance of the disruption of specific cognitive domains by lesions to distributed neural circuits, are discussed </plain></SENT>
