<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evaluation revealed the additional history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005753'>limb-shortening</z:hpo> procedures for the left leg, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo>, long-standing bilateral (left to right) lower extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath>, as well as soft tissue asymmetry with the left leg and arm larger than the right-sided counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome was made on the basis of these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the deep venous malformations known to occur in this syndrome, we sought evidence of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> as an explanation for the patient's progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo>, despite negative pulmonary arteriography and ventilation-perfusion scanning results at another institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat pulmonary arteriography demonstrated evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient is presently being treated with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> anticoagulation, with plans for placement of a caval filter if anticoagulation alone is insufficient to prevent further embolism </plain></SENT>
