<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The published results of treating internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with the PED do not necessarily apply to its use in the posterior circulation because disabling brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> can be caused by occlusion of a single perforator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this multicenter study, we assessed the safety of PED placement in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective case registry was maintained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with PEDs at 3 Australian neurointerventional centers during a 27-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective was to assess the complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion rates associated with posterior circulation PEDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or poor neurologic outcomes occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perforator territory infarctions occurred in 3 (14%) of the 21 patients with basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3, a single PED was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two asymptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture or PED <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of permanent neurologic complications was 9.4% (3/32); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 patients had very mild residual symptoms and a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion was demonstrated in 85% of patients with &gt;6 months of follow-up and 96% of patients with &gt;1 year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PED is effective in the treatment of posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that are otherwise difficult or impossible to treat with standard endovascular or surgical techniques, and its safety is similar to that of stent-assisted coiling techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A higher clinical perforator infarction rate may be associated with basilar artery PEDs relative to the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
