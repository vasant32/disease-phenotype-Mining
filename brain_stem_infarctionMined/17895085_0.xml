<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these, 40.6% presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, 50.0% presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 9.4% presented with both infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
