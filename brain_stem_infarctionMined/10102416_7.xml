<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Congenital variations in the configuration and size of the cerebral vessels may predispose to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES/METHODS: To illustrate that a hypoplastic basilar artery may lead to posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in adults, eight cases are reported from two university medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five men and three women with a mean age of 49.8 years are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the patients had other conventional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had hypoplastic basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had at least one hypoplastic vertebral artery (bilateral in five cases), and six patients had both posterior cerebral arteries originating from the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A hypoplastic basilar artery is frequently accompanied by vertebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and this can predispose adults to posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This entity can be suspected on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram, but conventional angiography will provide definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimal medical and surgical treatment of this condition is unresolved </plain></SENT>
