<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A formalism for analyzing pronominal cohesion was developed and applied to the narrative discourse of three hemidecorticate adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results revealed hemisphere-dependent differences in overall narrative skill as well as distinct individual discourse strategies </plain></SENT>
