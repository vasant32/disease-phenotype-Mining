<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient had suffered either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system or brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with complete or partial recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> of both vertebral arteries and bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients died shortly after surgery because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients no anastomosis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two other patients also died 2.5 years after the operations because of a metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the remaining 16 patients have either improved or remained the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient has gotten worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had anastomosis, a patency rate of 87.5 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The blood flow of the occipital artery was measured intraoperatively following the completion of anastomosis in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean blood flow varied between 15-80 ML/min. with an average of 46 ML/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neurological mortality and morbidity in this operation, in addition to the neurological condition of the patient prior to surgery, seem to be significantly related to the position of the patient during the surgery and how well his vital signs, especially blood pressure, are kept within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A lateral semiprone position, with the head and neck flexed and about 5 degrees above the heart level, seems to be a satisfactory position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With careful selection of the patients and the maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vital signs, especially during surgery, good results can be obtained </plain></SENT>
