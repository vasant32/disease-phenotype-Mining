<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a series of 19 patients (19 eyes) with choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> treated with proton beam therapy between July 1988 and August 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> were treated with proton beam irradiation using a light-field technique and doses ranging from 15 to 30 cobalt Gray equivalents (CGE; CGE = proton Gy x relative biological effectiveness 1.1) in 4 fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with at least 6 months' follow-up were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>Tumor regression</z:mp>, visual acuity, absorption of subretinal fluid, and treatment-associated complications were evaluated by clinical examination and ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual acuity improved or remained stable in 14 of 18 eyes (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subretinal fluid was initially present in 16 of 19 eyes (84%), and completely resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> height, as measured by B-scan ultrasonography, decreased in 18 of 19 eyes and remained stable in 1 of 19, as of the last examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications of radiation developed in 9 of 19 eyes (47%) with the total applied dose ranging from 15 to 30 CGE for these 9 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam irradiation using a light-field technique without surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> localization is an effective treatment option in managing both circumscribed choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A total proton dose as low as 15 CGE applied in 4 fractions appears to be sufficient to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, promote absorption of subretinal fluid, and improve or stabilize vision in most patients </plain></SENT>
