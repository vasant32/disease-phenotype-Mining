<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our experience with 4 ruptured and 2 unruptured VA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and discuss the efficacy of endovascular surgery using stents </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were successfully treated using stents; in 5 we also coil-embolized the aneurysmal lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by the placement of 2 stents covering the dissection site; there was a danger of aneurysmal rupture during coil embolization </plain></SENT>
