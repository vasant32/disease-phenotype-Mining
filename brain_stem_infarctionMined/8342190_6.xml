<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography and [123I]iodoamphetamine to measure regional differences in tracer uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Qualitative image analysis and calculated asymmetry indexes were correlated to the location of the infarcted area on magnetic resonance imaging and to the patients' clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant perfusion asymmetries were noted in the two patients with infarction in the upper pons but not in those with lesions below this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They comprised a contralateral cerebellar and ipsilateral supratentorial <z:mp ids='MP_0001402'>hypoactivity</z:mp> that was most marked in the frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no clear relation between the patterns of cerebral or cerebellar tracer uptake and specific neurological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Remote perfusion changes after pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> may be seen both infratentorially and supratentorially and depend on the lesion site rather than on the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this context, our study confirmed damage to the corticopontocerebellar pathways as the key event in the genesis of a crossed cerebellar diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanisms causing ipsilateral cerebral hemispheric diaschisis await further clarification </plain></SENT>
