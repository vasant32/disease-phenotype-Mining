<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> included head injury (15), <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> (6), and brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSA was classified on the basis of frequency and alternating or nonalternating patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternating CSA was significantly associated with survival (p less than 0.005) in the head-injured and anoxic group combined, and in the head-injured subgroup (p less than 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prognostic value of CSA equaled the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale or neurologic examination and occasionally added prognostic information </plain></SENT>
