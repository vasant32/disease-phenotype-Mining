<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the low resistance of vascular tissue, vascular injury and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are frequently found in cases of high-voltage electric injury but are rarely reported in low-voltage conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a diabetic woman who suffered symptomatic brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after a short duration of 60 Hz/110 V alternate current electric contact with a home washer socket </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factor survey did not reveal remarkable cardiac or vascular abnormality, except increased glycohemoglobin levels and decreased protein C activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a direct and adequate energy transfer in high-voltage electric injury, a pre-existing vasculohemostatic deficit, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, has been proposed to provide a predisposition to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in low-voltage electric injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the findings in this patient remind the possibility of physical triggering factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence in our environment as new technology and product generates rapidly enough for understanding their safety and biologic effect </plain></SENT>
