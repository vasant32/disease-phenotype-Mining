<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Locked-in syndrome</z:e> is a state of preserved consciousness in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002425'>anarthria</z:hpo>, and usually also includes lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is most commonly associated with upper <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> variably sparing the third cranial nerve nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are likely many etiologies that contribute to this clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These are incompletely understood, and the syndrome remains a rare but devastating complication that can occur after neurosurgical and neurovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as perfusion and diffusion tensor imaging may help to elucidate the mechanism behind <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, there are no reports in the literature of perfusion and diffusion tensor findings in patients with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A postprocedural case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> is described with abnormalities on perfusion and diffusion tensor imaging in the absence of any changes in conventional magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, and other nonspecific symptoms was found on imaging to have a giant fusiform basilar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A saphenous vein graft bypass between the proximal right external carotid artery and P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery followed immediately by endovascular embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac and distal left vertebral artery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postprocedural angiography demonstrated patency of the bypass graft, and diffusion weighted imaging showed no evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, despite technically successful procedures and the absence of abnormalities on conventional magnetic resonance imaging, the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002425'>anarthria</z:hpo> and remained in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in state</z:e> until he expired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were, however, seen on both perfusion and diffusion tensor imaging, where hypoperfusion, increased mean diffusivity, and decreased fractional anisotropy were observed in the ventral brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings suggested a disruption of pontine white matter tracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Advanced imaging techniques may allow us to image important microstructural changes that were previously not discernable and assist in the evaluation of patients with complex neurological sequelae such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
