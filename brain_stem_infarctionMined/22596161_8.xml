<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that people with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5â€‰years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo>, years after injury to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals </plain></SENT>
