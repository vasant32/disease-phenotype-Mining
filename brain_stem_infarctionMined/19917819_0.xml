<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report investigates the prognostic impact of the posterior communicating artery (PcoA) and whether its <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> is a safeguard or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> with at least 50% stenosis of BA upon CT angiography (CTA) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The configuration of PcoA was divided into two groups upon CTA: "textbook" group (invisible PcoA with good P1 and P2 segment) and "fetal-variant of PcoA" group (only visible PcoA with absent P1 segment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline demographics, radiological findings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multiple regression analysis was performed to predict clinical outcome at 30 days (modified Rankin disability Scale (mRS&lt;or=2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 95 patients, 58% (n = 55) had good prognoses (mRS&lt;or=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 44 patients (46.3%) had at least one fetal-variant PcoA (26 bilateral, 18 unilateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multiple logistic regression analysis, the atherosclerotic mechanism (OR 18.0; 95% CI 3.0 to 107.0) and presence of fetal-variant PcoA (OR 5.1; 95% CI 1.4 to 18.8) were independent predictors for good prognosis and initial NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale score (OR 1.24 per one-point increase; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) for poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fetal-variant PcoA appears to act as a safeguard against ischaemic insult in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> victims involving the brainstem with BA occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This result can be explained by the fact that patients with fetal-variant PcoA have a smaller area of posterior circulation and a possibility of retrograde filling into the upper brainstem through the fetal-variant PcoA </plain></SENT>
