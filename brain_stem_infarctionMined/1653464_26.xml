<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>Hemangioma</z:hpo> was present in 137 patients (95.1%), varicosity in 110 (76.4%), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the soft tissues or bones in 134 (93.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most patients (71.5%) the disease involved one lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic workup included roentgenogram to document limb length discrepancy, noninvasive arterial and venous evaluation, contrast venography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients did well without treatment or with elastic compression only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment for the vascular malformation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> is rarely needed and it continues to be controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the risks and benefits of vascular interventions, we examined in detail the clinical histories of nine patients who in the last decade underwent operation for a vascular malformation of the lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In seven patients we removed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> or resected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> of the lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although none was cured, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five who underwent resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> and one of the two patients who underwent resection of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients, however, who underwent resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> in another institution had worsening of the symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient we performed deep venous reconstruction for atresia of the superficial femoral vein, using the contralateral saphenous vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such operation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient has a patent graft with a competent valve and clinical improvement 6 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo>, disturbing cosmetic appearance, or complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> may benefit from surgical treatment, detailed preoperative imaging of the extremity and pelvis with magnetic resonance imaging and contrast venography is needed to decrease complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Rarely, reconstruction for atresia or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the deep veins may be needed </plain></SENT>
