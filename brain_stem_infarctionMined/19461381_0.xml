<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience with surgical intervention for symptomatic intraarticular vascular malformations of the knee in patients with peripheral vascular malformations including Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã©naunay syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical intervention for symptomatic intraarticular vascular malformations of the knee between 1987 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, and 4 patients had venous malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications, imaging studies, clinical course, surgical procedures, complications, and follow-up visits were reviewed and recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 11 patients (8 males; 3 females; mean age, 11.7 years; range, 2.5-23 years) underwent 12 surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients had an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, and 6 patients had knee synovectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had bilateral knee synovectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications included pain, swelling, limited mobility, and/or loss of knee motion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average time of follow-up was 54 months (range, 7-109 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported pain scores decreased significantly from a mean of 2.9 +/- 1.4 preoperatively to 1.3 +/- 0.9 postoperatively (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When necessary, surgical intervention for intraarticular vascular malformations of the knee (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> or synovectomy) may be effective in decreasing pain and improving mobility in patients with peripheral vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is possible that early synovectomy may slow or prevent the rapid destructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> that occurs in these knees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgeons and patients should anticipate complications related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, particularly when surgical intervention is indicated </plain></SENT>
