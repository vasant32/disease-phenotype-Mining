<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the patients with hearing loss had transient low-frequency SNHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low-frequency SNHL is seldom noted in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155550" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retrocochlear hearing loss</z:e>, but five of these patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of Békésy audiometry, auditory brainstem response, and electrocochleography in the patients were also suggestive of brainstem pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical records revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them had excessively short perforating arteries surrounding the entry zone of nerves VII and VIII, so that they had to be stretched during surgery </plain></SENT>
