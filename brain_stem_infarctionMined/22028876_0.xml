<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 1 (also called ALK1), is a serine-threonine kinase predominantly expressed on endothelial cells surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in its ACVRL1 encoding gene (12q11-14) cause type 2 Hereditary Haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>Telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT2), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> multisystem <z:mp ids='MP_0001614'>vascular dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study of the structural effects of mutations is crucial to understand their pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, while an X-ray structure of ALK1 intracellular domain has recently become available (PDB ID: 3MY0), structure determination of ALK1 ectodomain (ALK1(EC)) has been elusive so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We here describe the building of a homology model for ALK1(EC), followed by an extensive bioinformatic analysis, based on a set of 38 methods, of the effect of missense mutations at the sequence and structural level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ALK1(EC) potential interaction mode with its ligand BMP9 was then predicted combining modelling and docking data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The calculated model of the ALK1(EC) allowed mapping and a preliminary characterization of HHT2 associated mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major structural changes and loss of stability of the protein were predicted for several mutations, while others were found to interfere mainly with binding to BMP9 or other interactors, like Endoglin (CD105), whose encoding ENG gene (9q34) mutations are known to cause type 1 HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study gives a preliminary insight into the potential structure of ALK1(EC) and into the structural effects of HHT2 associated mutations, which can be useful to predict the potential effect of each single mutation, to devise new biological experiments and to interpret the biological significance of new mutations, private mutations, or non-synonymous polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
