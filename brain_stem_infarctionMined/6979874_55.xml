<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cranial nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scans were performed on 13 healthy volunteers and 140 patients with a broad spectrum of neurologic disease and compared with x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The NMR scans included a variety of sequences reflecting proton density, blood flow, T1, and T2 as well as transverse, sagittal, and coronal images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were clearly distinguished in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain with inversion-recovery (IR) sequences, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progressive myelination was demonstrated in infants and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> displayed short T1 values, but other pathologic processes such as infarction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> were associated with long T1 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>Cysts</z:mpath> had very long T1 values (about that of cerebrospinal fluid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spin-echo (SE) sequences showed increased values of T2 in a variety of conditions and highlighted lesions against the relatively featureless background of the remaining brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With inversion-recovery scans, different stages of infarction were recognized in the hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NMR was more useful than CT in demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The white matter lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating diseases</z:e> were well demonstrated with NMR scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many more lesions were observed in multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> with NMR than with CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Benign tumors</z:e> were well seen and usually had shorter T1 values than <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mass effects from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were generally better demonstrated with NMR than with CT, including more subtle mass effects such as displacement of the external capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities were seen in diseases of the basal ganglia, including marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the head of the caudate nucleus in Huntington <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Advantages of NMR imaging include the high level of gray-white matter contrast, lack of bone artifact, variety of possible sequences, transverse, sagittal, and coronal imaging, sensitivity to pathologic change, and lack of known hazard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages include lack of bone detail, limited spatial resolution, lack of contrast agents, and cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Promising directions for future clinical research include developmental neurology, tissue characterization with T1 and T2, assessment of blood flow, and the development of contrast agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Much more detailed evaluation will be required, but NMR seems to be a potentially important addition to existing techniques of neurologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
