<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One year later central post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pain had developed in the affected limb with touch and cold <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P40m dipoles calculated from magnetoencephalographic fields after electrical stimulation of both tibial nerves were localized in SI as is seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, stimulation of the affected side caused deep pain sensations and elicited a large N80m component, best explained by an additionally active dipole in cingulate cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This early co-activation in a limbic structure suggests peripheral Abeta-fiber mediation and lemniscal projection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abnormal link to the pain system may be due to sensitization and reorganization above the level of nociceptive deafferentation </plain></SENT>
