<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The brainstem tegmentum, including the reticular formation, contains distinct nuclei, each of which has a set of chemical, physiological and anatomical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Damage to the brainstem tegmentum is known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, the most radical disturbance of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has remained unclear which nuclei within the tegmentum are crucial for the maintenance of consciousness in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we initiated a retrospective study of MRIs obtained from 47 patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion boundaries were charted on patient MRIs and transferred onto a corresponding series of 4.7 T MRIs obtained from a control brainstem specimen that later was cut on a freezing microtome and analysed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, medical charts and available post-mortem materials were used to obtain relevant clinical and anatomical data to verify the MRI readings in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that in the 38 patients who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, brainstem damage either was located outside the tegmentum (n = 29) or produced a very small and unilateral compromise of the tegmentum (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> (n = 9), the lesions in the tegmentum were mostly bilateral (n = 7) and were located either in the pons alone (n = 4) or in the upper pons and the midbrain (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum overlap territory of the lesions coincided with the location of the rostral raphe complex, locus coeruleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, nucleus pontis oralis, parabrachial nucleus and the white matter in between these nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also found that four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> and died in the absence of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the maximum lesion overlap was centred in the core of pontine tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that lesions confined to the upper pons can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> in humans even in the absence of damage to the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings also point to the brainstem nuclei whose lesions are likely to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
