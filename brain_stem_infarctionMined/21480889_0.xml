<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate clinical correlates and longitudinal course of interictal focal cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypermetabolism in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans of 60 children (age range 3 months to 15.2 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were assessed prospectively and serially for focal hypo- or hypermetabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had two or more consecutive PET scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables, and the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery were compared between patients with and without focal hypermetabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of focal hypermetabolism was also assessed and correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Interictal cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypermetabolism, ipsilateral to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, was seen in nine patients, with the most common location in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age was lower in patients with hypermetabolism than in those without (p=0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, time difference between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and the first PET scan was much shorter in children with increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism than in those without (mean: 1.0 vs. 3.6 years; p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased metabolism was transient and switched to hypometabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five children where follow-up scans were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypermetabolism occurred in 28% of children younger than the age of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children with transient hypermetabolism had a higher rate of subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery as compared to those without hypermetabolism (p=0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: Interictal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypermetabolism in young children with SWS is most often seen within a short time before or after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of first clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, that is, the presumed period of epileptogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism detected by PET predicts future demise of the affected cortex based on a progressive loss of metabolism and may be an imaging marker of the most malignant cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> requiring surgery in SWS </plain></SENT>
