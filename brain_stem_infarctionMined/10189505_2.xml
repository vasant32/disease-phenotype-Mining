<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After resuscitation, a laceration on the first tracheal cartilage was closed surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As she was extubated one week later, she was found to have right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">muteness</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI showed a T2-bright lesion on the tegmentum of the left midbrain down to the upper pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right vertebral angiography disclosed an intimal flap with stenosis at the C3 vertebral level presumably caused by a fracture of the right C3 transverse process later confirmed in a cervical 3D-CT scan </plain></SENT>
