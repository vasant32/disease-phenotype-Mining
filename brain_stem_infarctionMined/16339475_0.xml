<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal medical management of this condition is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF CASE: We present a patient with a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> and filiform distal basilar residual lumen attributable to arterioarterial or cardiogenic embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Beginning 3 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, low-dose intravenous thrombolysis with 0.125 mg/kg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was continuously infused for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography revealed complete resolution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No further cerebral ischemic episodes occurred during 3-month follow-up, and the basilar artery remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our observation suggests a potential for prolonged low-dose intravenous thrombolysis in basilar artery embolism, but further data are needed to judge the effectiveness and risk of this intervention </plain></SENT>
