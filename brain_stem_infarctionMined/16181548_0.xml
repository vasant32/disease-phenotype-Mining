<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 51 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> and vascular malformation involving the duodenum, jejunum and ileum in the past 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient's age ranged from 1.4 to 75.0 years, with an average/median age of 40 years for the 51 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of male and female was almost equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the lesions were located in the ileum (18 cases) and jejunum (16 cases) accounting for 66.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant symptoms and signs were either intestinal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grossly, the lesions appeared as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_491'>polyp</z:mpath>-like, ulcerative, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath>, solitary mass, diffuse infiltration or in an occult status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, arteriovenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> also called <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> was more common seen accounting for 86.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other less common vascular lesions included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001048'>cavernous hemangioma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005306'>capillary hemangioma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341217" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Dieulafoy disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Histologic classification and denomination for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> and vascular malformation of small intestine are still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is very important to correlate clinical manifestations with arteriography findings in histologic diagnosis of hemanigoma and vascular malformation of the small intestine </plain></SENT>
