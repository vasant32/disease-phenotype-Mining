<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Disabled patients with appropriate physical care and cognitive ability to communicate with their social environment continue to live with a reasonable quality of life over extended periods of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which utilizes light in the near-infrared range (700 to 1000 nm) to determine cerebral oxygenation, blood flow and metabolic status of localized regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe a study conducted to test the feasibility of using multichannel NIRS in the development of a BCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a continuous wave 20-channel NIRS system over the motor cortex of 5 healthy volunteers to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> changes during left-hand and right-hand motor imagery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present results of signal analysis indicating that there exist distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses which could be utilized in a pattern classifier towards developing a BCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We applied two different pattern recognition algorithms separately, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="24564">HMM</z:chebi>), to classify the data offline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SVM classified left-hand imagery from right-hand imagery with an average accuracy of 73% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> volunteers, while <z:chebi fb="8" ids="24564">HMM</z:chebi> performed better with an average accuracy of 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate potential application of NIRS in the development of BCIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also discuss here future extension of our system to develop a word speller application based on a cursor control paradigm incorporating online pattern classification of single-trial NIRS data </plain></SENT>
