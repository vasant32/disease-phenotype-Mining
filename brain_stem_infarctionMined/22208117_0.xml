<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a completely new output pathway that can provide an additional option for a person to express himself/herself if he/she suffers a disorder like <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> (ALS), brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, brain or spinal cord injury or other diseases which impair the function of the common output pathways which are responsible for the control of muscles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For a P300 based BCI a matrix of randomly flashing characters is presented to the participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To spell a character the person has to attend to it and to count how many times the character flashes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although most BCIs are designed to help people with disabilities, they are mainly tested on healthy, young subjects who may achieve better results than people with impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare measurements, performed on people suffering motor impairments, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or ALS, to measurements performed on healthy people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall accuracy of the persons with motor impairments reached 70.1% in comparison to 91% obtained for the group of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When looking at single subjects, one interesting example shows that under certain circumstances, when it is difficult for a patient to concentrate on one character for a longer period of time, the accuracy is higher when fewer flashes (i.e., stimuli) are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the influence of several tuning parameters is discussed as it shows that for some participants adaptations for achieving valuable spelling results are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, exclusion criteria for people who are not able to use the device are defined </plain></SENT>
