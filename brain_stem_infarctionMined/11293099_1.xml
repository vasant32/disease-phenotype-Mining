<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The association of external <z:hpo ids='HP_0005306'>capillary hemangiomas</z:hpo> with intracranial malformations (vascular or nonvascular) was first described by Pascual-Castroviejo in 1978 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonest anomalies found included: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010964" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="DWS|DWM">Dandy-Walker syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001321'>cerebellar hypoplasia</z:hpo>, arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> and alterations in the origin or distribution of the main cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1996 the same author named it the 'hemangiovascular complex syndrome' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The syndrome association is very similar, perhaps even identical, to that recently described in the English literature under the heading of PHACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: We describe two new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo>, Dandy-Walker type posterior fossa malformation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the carotid-vertebral trunk ipsilateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a three year old girl had needed a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> secondary to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001305'>Dandy-Walker malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the third month she had severe symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005945'>laryngeal obstruction</z:hpo> due to the angiomatous lesion and was satisfactorily treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the present time her psychomotor development seems <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on neurological examination and evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a thirteen year old boy, besides showing the characteristic features of this syndrome also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007018'>attention-deficit</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and clumsy movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both cases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo> was present at birth and gradually became smaller although it did not disappear completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is important to know about this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">neurocutaneous syndrome</z:e> to avoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with similar conditions such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, so as to carry out suitable clinical investigations: cerebral magnetic resonance, angio-resonance of the intracranial vessels and supra-aortic trunks, arteriography, echocardiography and ophthalmological assessment and to prevent signs of upper respiratory tract obstruction which may be very serious </plain></SENT>
