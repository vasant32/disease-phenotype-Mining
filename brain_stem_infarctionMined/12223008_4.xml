<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> (AAA) repair with a commercial modular stent-graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between February 1998 and May 2000, 66 consecutive patients (56 men; mean age 70 years, range 51-87) were recruited for a single-center study to examine the safety and efficacy of the Excluder stent-graft for endovascular AAA repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were predominantly asymptomatic (2 symptomatic) and categorized as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> III or IV (62, 94%), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that ranged from 35 to 89 mm in diameter (mean 56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surveillance included clinical examination and computed tomographic aortography at discharge, 6 weeks, and at 6, 12, and 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> endoprostheses were implanted as intended, but 1 patient succumbed to an intraprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> (1.5% 30-day mortality rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major and minor morbidity rates were 21% and 4.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary technical success at discharge was 68% (45/66), largely as the result of a 30% (20/66) endoleak rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exclusion rate at 30 days was 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the mean 5.8-month follow-up, no device migration, limb kinking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture, or limb <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endoluminal AAA repair with the bifurcated Excluder stent-graft is safe and efficacious in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer surveillance will have to demonstrate if the excellent early results can be maintained over the years </plain></SENT>
