<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied clinical characteristics and coexisting causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 305 patients admitted to a population-based primary care center with an initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a potential cardiac source of embolism (PCSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using systematic standardized cardiac, arterial, and cerebral investigations and the logistics of the prospective Lausanne <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry, we found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, hemianopia without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or hemisensory disturbances, Wernicke's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, ideomotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002186'>apraxia</z:hpo>, involvement of specific territories (posterior division of middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, cerebellum, multiple territories), and a hemorrhagic component were associated with the presence of a PCSE, as compared with 1,006 initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients without PCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although age and sex did not differ, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, cigarette smoking, elevated blood cholesterol, and deep hemispheric or brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was higher in the patients without a PCSE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly one-fourth of the patients with a PCSE had a coexisting potential arterial cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (large artery greater than or equal to 50% stenosis or small-vessel disease) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the majority of patients with a PCSE (76.7%), cardioembolism was the most likely cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, although a direct source of embolism was uncommon (4.3%) and intracranial embolic occlusions were present in less than one-half of the patients who were angiographed </plain></SENT>
