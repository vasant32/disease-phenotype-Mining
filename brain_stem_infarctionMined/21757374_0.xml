<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The goal of the study was to clarify the association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> (BSIs) and to investigate the clinicotopographic characteristics of BSIs in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were retrospectively reviewed for 1026 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> from January 2004 to August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> symptomatic BSIs were explored on radiologic images and classified into multiple infarctions with BSIs, multifocal BSIs, and monofocal BSIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated BSIs were further classified based on the vertical distribution into midbrain, pontine, and medullary infarctions, and on the horizontal distribution into anterior-dominant, posterior-dominant, and anterior/posterior BSIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic symptoms of BSIs and clinical background were compared between DM and non-DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of BSIs was 2.6-fold higher (P &lt; .0001) in DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis including age, sex, smoking, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, and DM showed that DM was independently associated with BSIs (odds ratio [OR] 2.814; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.936-4.090; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-DM patients, DM patients showed more frequent monofocal BSIs (P &lt; .0001) and multifocal BSIs (P = .0296) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monofocal BSIs (n = 114) more frequently involved the pons (P &lt; .0001) and medulla (P = .0212) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anterior-dominant BSIs (P &lt; .0001) were more common in DM patients than in non-DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of BSIs included more frequent motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> (P = .0180) and less frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> (P = .0298) in DM patients than in non-DM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DM is important in the development of BSIs, and the associated clinical characteristics include more frequent motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> and less frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
