<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 children, adolescents, and young adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> with brain involvement were recruited from our Sturge-Weber center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> underwent neurologic examination (including review of clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging) and neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological assessment included measures of intellectual ability and standardized parent report of adaptive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, Full Scale IQ and ratings of global adaptive functioning were both lower than the population-based norms (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Negative correlations were identified between adaptive functioning ratings, clinician ratings of cortical abnormality, and ratings of neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>Hemiparesis</z:hpo> (minimal versus prominent) was the only individual component of the rating scales that differentiated between individuals with nonimpaired and impaired adaptive functioning scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Information obtained during neurological examination of children and adolescents with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> particularly hemiparetic status is useful for identifying children who may need additional intervention </plain></SENT>
