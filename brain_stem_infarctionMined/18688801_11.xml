<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who experienced development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients who were diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> based on their electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were selected from among 569 consecutive patients who were admitted to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of nine previously published cases were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients were women, and six were 75 years or older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score ranged from 3 to 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The culprit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> included or were close to the insular cortex in six patients and were located extensively in the vertebrobasilar arterial territory in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings on electrocardiographic monitoring appeared within 10 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in five patients and at 6 and 12 days, respectively, in the other two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> was symptomatic in only two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels exceeded the upper <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limit by 10-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The previously published cases were mostly women and had mainly vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> is not a rare complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It most often occurred soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and was commonly asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Female sex and insular damage were predominant features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who experienced development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011665'>takotsubo cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
