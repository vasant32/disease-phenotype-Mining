<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> presenting with skew deviation of the eyes were analyzed for static vestibular function in the roll plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions were allocated to the level and side of the brainstem by the clinical syndrome and neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two findings of clinical relevance were obtained: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> skew deviations were ipsiversive (ipsilateral eye was undermost) with caudal pontomedullary lesions and contraversive (contralateral eye was lowermost) with rostral pontomesencephalic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> skew deviations were associated with concomitant ocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> and tilts of subjective visual vertical toward the undermost eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, skew deviation or more correctly, ocular skew <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> is a sensitive brainstem sign of localizing and lateralizing value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence is presented that the ocular skew <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> sign indicates a vestibular tone imbalance in the roll plane secondary to graviceptive pathway lesions </plain></SENT>
