<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To highlight the risks of investigation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">swallowing disorders</z:e> by "<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow", when the disorders may arise from dysfunction of the upper swallowing tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: An 81-year-old Italian woman presented to her local doctor with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> of five days' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of a large amount of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> into the right main bronchus, causing severe problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a period of intensive respiratory care including intubation and continuous positive airway pressure, she recovered sufficiently to be referred to a rehabilitation unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> but severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, secondary to a brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Persisting severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> was confirmed, with extreme risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and was discharged to live independently, but requiring long-term gastrostomy feeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When a patient presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, great care should be taken to exclude upper tract dysfunction with its attendant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, generally by referral to a centre or consultant with expertise in this area, before ordering or carrying out investigations appropriate to disorders of the lower tract </plain></SENT>
