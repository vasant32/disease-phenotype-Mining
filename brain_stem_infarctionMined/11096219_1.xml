<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To understand malalignments of the visual axes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e>, we measured eye positions in 4 patients with this syndrome under two conditions: with Frenzel goggles to prevent eye fixation and without Frenzel goggles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When fixation was prevented with the Frenzel goggles, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed mild outward deviation in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Removal of the Frenzel goggles elicited adduction of the eye ipsilateral to the side of the lesion for fixation, with greater outward deviation of the contralateral eye (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage), or adduction of both eyes to midposition for biocular fixation (convalescent stage) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients whose outward eye deviation with Frenzel goggles was greater on the ipsilateral side, a transition from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e> to ipsilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> was noted, whereas a transition to ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e> was seen in the one patient whose deviation was greater on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e> patients, the eyes tend to be in divergent positions when fixation is prevented; ipsilateral eye deviation may result from medial longitudinal fasciculus involvement, and contralateral eye deviation may result from paramedian pontine reticular formation involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Viewing a target may lead to a secondary deviation or adaptation of eye positions for fixation </plain></SENT>
