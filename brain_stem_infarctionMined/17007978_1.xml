<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are three types of lesions involving lymphatic development that must be included in LM: vascular anomalies and knots (truncal malformations [TLM]); cystic anomalies, superficial or deep, uni- or multicystic (extratruncal malformations [ETLM]) and hemolymphatic anomalies which combine venous, arterial, or capillary malformations with LM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ETLM can be ubiquitously distributed but most are located in the cervical or axillary regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most ETLM are diagnosed at birth and in 80-90% of the cases before the age of 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical aspects are extremely variable: superficial ETLM (vesicular) and deep ETLM, localised or diffuse, mono- or multicystic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TLM are generally located on a lower limb with neonatal lymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> (often in a polymalformation context) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> forms of the hemolymphatic combination can be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They are generally located on the limbs and are often unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> but can also be can be found in polymalformation syndromes (Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay, Parkes-Weber, Protée, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Maffucci</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ETLM generally tend to increase in volume and spread with age with stabilisation at puberty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They do not tend to spontaneously regress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific local complications can have serious consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They are linked to haemorrhaging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and compression phenomena </plain></SENT>
