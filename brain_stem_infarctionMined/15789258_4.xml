<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility and safety of stenting intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 12 patients the results of primary intracranial stenting were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient ages ranged from 49 to 79 years (mean 64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients presented with stenoses in the anterior circulation, and six had stenosis in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient presented with extra- and intracranial tandem stenosis of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, caused by high-grade basilar stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial stenoses were successfully stented in 11 of 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient the stent could not be advanced over the carotid siphon to reach the stenosis of the ophthalmic internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up digital subtraction angiographic studies were obtained in two patients who had presented with new neurologic signs or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both cases the angiogram did not show any relevant stenotic endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, after local thrombolysis the stenosis turned out to be so narrow that balloon angioplasty had to be performed before stent deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients treated for stenosis-related basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> died due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> that had ensued before the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic primary stenting of intracranial stenoses of the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation can be performed with a low complication rate; technical problems such as stent flexibility must still be solved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Local thrombolysis followed by stenting in stenosis-related thrombotic occlusion is technically possible </plain></SENT>
