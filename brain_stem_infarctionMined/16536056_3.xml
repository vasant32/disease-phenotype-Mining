<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was studied by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, in human brainstems taken at autopsy from 15 adults (age range: 25-58 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nuclei examined included the hypoglossal nucleus (XII), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV), solitary tract nucleus (STN), vestibular nucleus (Ve), cuneate nucleus (Cu), nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract (NSTT), principal inferior olivary nucleus (PION), medial inferior olivary nucleus (MION) and dorsal inferior olivary nucleus (DION) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each nucleus, the apoptotic index was expressed as the percentage of TUNEL-positive neurons out of the total number of neurons counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-way ANOVA revealed that the differences in apoptotic index among the nuclei were statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cu had the highest index, corresponding to 29.5 +/- 14.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Student-Newman-Keuls test revealed significant differences when this value was compared with those of XII (14.1 +/- 12.0%; P&lt;0.05), PION (12.8 +/- 13.8%; P&lt;0.01), DION (12.0 +/-12.4%; P&lt;0.01), MION (12.0 +/- 15.7%; P&lt;0.01), STN (8.5 +/- 11.9%; P&lt;0.001) and DMNV (5.4 +/- 6.8%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differences in apoptotic index between Cu and NSTT (27.1 +/- 18.1%) and between Cu and Ve (23.7 +/- 12.6%) were not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The apoptotic index in the NSTT was higher than in DMNV (P&lt;0.001), STN (P&lt;0.01) and nuclei of the inferior olivary complex (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ve showed a higher apoptotic index with respect to DMNV (P&lt;0.01) and STN (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic processes found in the brainstems were ascribed to hypoxic-ischemic injury, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in apoptotic index among the nuclei supports the hypothesis of the differing vulnerability of the nuclei of the brainstem </plain></SENT>
