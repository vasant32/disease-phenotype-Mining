<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OPINION STATEMENT: During the past few years, the branch syndromes have been ascribed to pontine lesions, and the development of neuroimaging techniques has renewed the interest in exploring their clinical-radiological correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain imaging via MRI has helped in the diagnosis and accurate localization of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From classic studies it is now accepted that the pathogenic mechanism of lacunar pontine infarction (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LPI</z:e>) is perforating small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microangiopathy</z:e> caused by lipohyalinosis, whereas paramedian pontine infarction (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi>) are caused by paramedian or circumferential basilar branch disease due to atheromatous branch occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The importance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269766" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery disease</z:e> not only in severe posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but also in minor brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> is known from previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="53266">PPI</z:chebi> is probably local occlusion of the mouths of paramedian perforators through the atheromatous basilar artery (basilar branch occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infrequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1269766" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">basilar artery diseases</z:e> such as dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, dolichoectatic basilar artery, embolism, or vasospasms are known to block the orifices of penetrating branch arteries and cause an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of the obstructed branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An association between basilar artery branch disease and isolated pontine infarction exists; moreover, the enlargement of pontine lesion seems to be associated with neurologic worsening and fluctuating symptoms, but we know little about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms in patients with fluctuating symptoms and about the role of branch atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment remains controversial, even in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Implementation of new neuroimaging techniques, such as high-resolution MRI, could be helpful in identifying pathogenetic mechanisms of isolated pontine infarction, thus improving therapeutic strategy and secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
