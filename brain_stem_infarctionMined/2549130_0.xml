<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This led to the decision to carry out a validity study in 12 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> (CVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with 0.25 mg or 0.5 DHE intravenously, and after that with 7.5 mg orally for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after treatment measurements of venous capacity, microcirculatory parameters and rheological parameters were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the i.v. injection of 0.25 to 0.5 mg DHE the venous capacity decreased significantly in a dose-dependent way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow of erythrocytes in capillaries measured under resting condition was significantly lower and peak flow of reactive hyperemia decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between the dose of DHE administered and the particular side effects (stomach trouble, increase in diastolic blood pressure) in 2 of the 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After oral treatment patients showed signs of subjective improvement of their complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results, the validity of non-invasive angiological tests is discussed </plain></SENT>
