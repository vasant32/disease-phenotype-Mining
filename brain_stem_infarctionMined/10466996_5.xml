<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1988 to 1993, valvuloplasty was performed in the superficial femoral vein of 33 lower extremities in 28 patients presenting recurring ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 23 cases, previous surgery in the superficial venous system or perforating vein had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative work-up demonstrated primary deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> (PDVI) in 22 extremities (group I), proximal PDVI in association with distal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postthrombotic syndrome</z:e> (PTS) in 10 (group II), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic assessment with tourniquet placement demonstrated a mean venous return time of 9 sec (+10, -8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descending femoral phlebography showed Kistner grade 4 in 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated by clinical examination and Dupplex scan with photophlethysmography at follow-up times ranging from 2 to 7.6 years (mean: 51 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlation between outcome of valvuloplasty and clinical findings was excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of poor clinical and hemodynamic results was higher for patients with PTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Valve repair in association with surgery for superficial vein insufficiency and ligation of perforators gives good results in patients with isolated PDVI </plain></SENT>
