<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both infants were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, cooled to 16 degrees, and exsanguinated before resection of these peripheral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgery was done as a lifesaving measure in both instances because both infants were suffering from high-output <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the small total blood volumes were critical in excision of these hypervascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Use of the techniques described allowed for the surgery to be performed in a bloodless field over a short period (one hour), thus preventing massive blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients are living with no neurologic or developmental deficits more than five years after the operation </plain></SENT>
