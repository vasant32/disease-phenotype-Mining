<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probes mounted over the suboccipital area by means of a helmet were used to measure rCBF over the brain stem and cerebellar regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When lying flat, rCBF values measured over both cerebral hemispheres and the brain stem-cerebellar regions in patients with VBI were not significantly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, regional flow reduction rarely persisted for three weeks after transient ischemic symptoms in patients with VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo> was induced, rCBF became significantly reduced in patients with VBI whether or not they were treated with papaverine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysautoregulation was restricted to vertebral, basilar, and posterior cerebral arterial distribution in patients with VBI of 1 to 12 months' duration, but was more widespread and involved both cerebral hemispheres in long-standing VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic factors and dysautoregulation appear to play a part in the pathogenesis of symptoms of VBI </plain></SENT>
