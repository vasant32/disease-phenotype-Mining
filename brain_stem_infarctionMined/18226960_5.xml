<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavior disorder</z:e> (RBD) is frequently seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can also be seen in brainstem lesions involving the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, RBD in patients with a pure pontine infarction has been rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 68-year-old man had a two-month history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008760'>violent behavior</z:hpo> during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His nocturnal behavior was screaming, thrashing of arms, punching or kicking his spouse, and falling out of bed associated with nightmares of being attacked by what he described as, "terrible animals frightening me." No remarkable neurological signs were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI was performed on this patient and it revealed a lacunar ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the right paramedian pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), there was phasic submental and limb electromyographic (EMG) tone and an absence of electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity during REM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hence, this patient was diagnosed with pontine infarction and RBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with clonazepam 0.25mg nightly resulted in the disappearance of nocturnal events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case with right pontine tegmental ischemic lesion provides evidence that the unilateral pontine lesion by itself is sufficient to cause RBD </plain></SENT>
