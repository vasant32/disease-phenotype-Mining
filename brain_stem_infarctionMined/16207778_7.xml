<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The nature of impairment in hand motor control after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its relationship to hand function are still not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated digit independence in patients with subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 8) and moderate hand impairment, defined by wrist and hand Fugl-Meyer scale scores &lt; or =25/33, and age-matched controls (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects made cyclical flexion-extension movements of an instructed digit while keeping the other digits as still as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Movements of the metacarpo-phalangeal (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>) joints of the five digits were measured using an instrumented glove </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability to move an instructed digit individually (individuation index), and the ability to keep a noninstructed digit as still as possible (stationarity index) were determined for each digit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrary to the finding of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thumb individuation in a recent study of patients with variable hand motor impairment after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, we found that independent movement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> digits was significantly impaired, although individuation and stationarity were differentially affected for each digit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the digits, including the thumb, showed a similar impairment in individuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, stationarity was affected in a digit-dependent pattern: the thumb was affected least, and the middle finger was most impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subjects did not extend their digits fully to the baseline position, and the angular displacement at maximum digit extension correlated significantly with digit individuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contrary to expectation, digit independence correlated weakly with clinical tests of hand function, which emphasize grasp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This suggests that corticospinal projections might be separated with respect to function rather than finger topography </plain></SENT>
