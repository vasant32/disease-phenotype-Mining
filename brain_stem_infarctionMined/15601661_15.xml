<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our current understanding of brainstem reflex <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> comes chiefly from the classic anatomical-functional correlation studies that traced the central circuits underlying brainstem reflexes and establishing reflex abnormalities as markers for specific areas of lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies nevertheless had the disadvantage of deriving from post-mortem findings in only a few patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a voxel-based model of the human brainstem designed to import and normalize MRIs, select groups of patients with or without a given dysfunction, compare their MRIs statistically, and construct three-plane maps showing the statistical probability of lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this method, we studied 180 patients with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent a dedicated MRI study of the brainstem and the whole series of brainstem tests currently used in clinical neurophysiology: early (R1) and late (R2) blink reflex, early (SP1) and late (SP2) masseter inhibitory reflex, and the jaw jerk to chin tapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significance levels were highest for R1, SP1 and R2 afferent abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three reflexes had lesions involving the primary sensory neurons in the ventral pons, before the afferents directed to the respective reflex circuits diverge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with an isolated abnormality of R1 and SP1 responses had lesions that involved the ipsilateral dorsal pons, near the fourth ventricle floor, and lay close to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The area with the highest probabilities of lesion for the R2-afferent abnormality was in the ipsilateral dorsal-lateral medulla at the inferior olive level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SP2 abnormalities reached a low level of significance, in the same region as R2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only few patients had a crossed-type abnormality of SP1, SP2 or R2; that of SP1 reached significance in the median pontine tegmentum rostral to the main trigeminal nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although abnormal in 38 patients, the jaw jerk appeared to have no cluster location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because our voxel-based model quantitatively compares lesions in patients with or without a given reflex abnormality, it minimizes the risk that the significant areas depict vascular territories rather than common spots within the territory housing the reflex circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>By analysing statistical data for a large cohort of patients, it also identifies the most frequent lesion location for each response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The finding of multireflex abnormalities reflects damage of the primary afferent neurons; hence it provides no evidence of an intra-axial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The jaw jerk, perhaps the brainstem reflex most widely used in clinical neurophysiology, had no apparent topodiagnostic value, probably because it depends strongly on peripheral variables, including dental occlusion </plain></SENT>
