<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a large series, we aimed to assess which topography of facial PWS can predict SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients with facial PWS seen in pediatric dermatologic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267370,C0085411" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiodysplasia</z:e> consultations from 1993 to 2005 at the University Hospital Center of Tours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A standardized form was used to collect data on clinical and imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with and without SWS were compared in terms of topography of the cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> and related ophthalmologic and neurologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hundred fifty-nine patients were included, 15 with a diagnosis of SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with SWS showed involvement of the V1 trigeminal cutaneous area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SWS was significantly associated with bilateral topography of the PWS, its extension to another territory, and involvement of the upper eyelid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the topography of facial PWS with risk of associated neurological or ocular anomalies allows for early diagnosis of SWS and avoids unnecessary and costly radiography for patients with uncomplicated facial PWS </plain></SENT>
