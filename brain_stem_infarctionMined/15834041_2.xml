<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The so called "top of the basilar" syndrome manifests clinically as numerous combinations of abnormalities of alertness, sleep-wake cycle, and behaviour and oculomotor or pupillomotor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 67 year old man presented with bilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, rubral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, and daytime <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was awake during the night and mostly agitated and aggressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An ischaemic lesion was visible on the magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) image in the central portion of the midbrain just ventral to the aqueduct, clearly affecting the paramedian structures bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic images demonstrated a hypoplastic basilar artery ending in both superior cerebellar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both posterior cerebral arteries were seen to arise from the corresponding internal carotid arteries via the posterior communicating branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This unique case of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> bilateral paramedian <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> represents a highly uncommon variant of the "top of the basilar" syndrome and was due to the affected ischaemic territory--that is, the "distal field" of the variant basilar artery </plain></SENT>
