<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few reports of the endovascular and microsurgical treatment of these lesions in the pediatric population, and the treatment outcomes of these patients are not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the clinical and radiographic outcomes of spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> in pediatric patients treated via endovascular and microsurgical modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified nine children (5 boys, 4 girls; average age 11 years, range 3-17 years) treated for spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> between 1998 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their charts were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> most frequently involved the thoracic spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had associated Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã¨naunay-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> and one had hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were two intramedullary, four conus medullaris, and three mixed extradural-intradural lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common presenting signs and symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (n = 3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo> (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Endovascular intervention was used exclusively in two patients, and combined endovascular and microsurgical intervention was used in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgery was the sole treatment in three patients with excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were two treatment-related complications: one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and one case of scrotal swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 28.5 months and the median was 8 months (range, 1-65 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean pretreatment World Health Organization (WHO)/Zubrod score was 2.4 (range, 1-4), and the mean post-treatment score was 1.4 (range, 0-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient (11%) had a recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> require complex combined microsurgical and endovascular techniques to achieve favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
