<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the nature of neurologic dysfunction after deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> during aortic arch surgery, we reconsidered the cases of 154 patients who had undergone aortic arch surgery (either of the ascending or transverse aorta, or both) between November 1993 and July 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temporary postoperative neurologic dysfunction was seen in 9 patients (5.8%), and another 3 patients (1.9%) experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with temporary neurologic dysfunction had no new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and were discharged home with no residual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scans revealed that 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the brainstem, and the 3rd had bilateral border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> died on postoperative days 7 and 15, and the patient with border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was discharged home with no symptoms 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that patients with neurologic deficits had significantly higher rates of history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting, <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> times longer than 90 minutes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the significant preoperative variables associated with neurologic deficits were a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and a <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> time longer than 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deep hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> is a safe and useful technique for protection of the brain during surgery for complex aortic problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In future, some patients at extreme risk for perioperative neurologic complications might be offered novel neuroprotective agents, in combination with deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
