<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a hospital-based population, the authors studied SPECT, CT, and MRI in 35 consecutive patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction clinically localized in the thalamus (7), posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) territory (15), brainstem (19), and cerebellum (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were noted in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, the SPECT sensitivity was lower than that of MRI (21% vs 93%, p = 0.004) and CT (42% vs 65%, p = 0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SPECT and CT sensitivities were not significantly different (67% vs 73%) for <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Performed within 24 hours, SPECT showed a relevant hypoperfusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, CT (33%, p = 0.074) and MRI (91%, p = 0.004) were more sensitive than SPECT, which showed no hemispheric hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of the three imaging techniques was 100% for large cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the small group of thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, the SPECT, CT, and MRI sensitivities were 14, 71, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, SPECT compared to CT and MRI is not helpful in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase to localize <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and is of limited value for thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the first hours, the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may help to differentiate them from hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> usually associated with profound hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
