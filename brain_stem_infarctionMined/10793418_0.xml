<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of persistent primitive trigeminal artery(PPTA) presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Weber's syndrome</z:e>, and document its unique findings of three-dimensional CT angiography(3 D-CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo> on the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination on admission revealed the right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oculomotor nerve palsy</z:e>, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which indicated the signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Weber's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial CT scan revealed no abnormality, but a subsequent 3 D-CTA demonstrated the PPTA originating from the right internal carotid artery penetrate into the clivus directly to the distal basilar artery, on top of which a small saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was incidentally visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right internal carotid angiograms showed the PPTA run between the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery and the distal portion of the basilar artery with the filling of both the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the proximal portion of the basilar artery was visualized through the right vertebral artery and there was no blood flow to its distal portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence of infarction was finally confirmed at the right midbrain and thalamus by the MRI performed 5 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a conservative treatment including physical therapy, the patient recovered well from the deficits and could walk by herself with a cane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With regard to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> in a patient with PPTA, it is generally considered that microembolus from an atherosclerotic carotid artery may be its cause because of the presence of direct communication between the anterior and posterior circulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present case, however, this mechanism may not be applied since there was no evidence of atherosclerotic plaque or stenotic lesions on the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, an embolic occlusion may have occurred in the paramedian branches of the posterior cerebral artery since a dilated PPTA itself, which resembled fusiform-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in appearance, may become the origin of microembolus </plain></SENT>
