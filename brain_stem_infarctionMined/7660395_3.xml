<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sympathetic dysfunction is known to manifest commonly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as cardiovascular and sudomotor dysregulation, but the knowledge so far obtained concerning skin temperature and vasomotor changes in cerebrovascular diseases is contradictory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate cutaneous temperature in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a prospective follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Skin temperature was measured at five sites on each side of the body at rest and after a heating stimulus in 44 patients with a hemispheric infarction, and in 19 patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and at 1 month and at 6 months after the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Skin temperatures on the forearm, leg, and foot on the side contralateral to the site of infarction were significantly lower than on the ipsilateral side during the whole 6-month follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Asymmetrical temperature was associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007256'>pyramidal tract signs</z:hpo> in hemispheric infarction and with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hemispheric infarction, the degree of asymmetrical temperature correlated with the severity of limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A temperature decline in the limbs contralateral to the site of infarction seems to be a frequent, long-lasting consequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon seems to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007256'>pyramidal tract signs</z:hpo> and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
