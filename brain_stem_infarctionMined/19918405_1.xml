<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge there are no documented cases of surgical fracture management in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 42-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e>, who had sustained a left femoral shaft fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated with a closed, locked intramedullary nailing procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nail was peripherally locked free-hand with a single screw due to the increased vascularity and intraoperative haemorrhage of the area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was transfused with 7 units of blood intra-operatively and was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where 3 more units of blood were transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her post-operative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One year following the operation the fracture had united and the patient remained well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The surgical management of long bone fractures in patients with such pathology is associated with increased intra and post-operative risk, mainly due to vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is therefore mandatory that high dependency facilities and sufficient quantities of blood products are available prior to the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A less invasive fixation method should be used when possible </plain></SENT>
