<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, and prognostic significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a prospective study using quantitative evaporimetry to investigate spontaneous and heat-stimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> in 18 healthy control subjects and 18 patients with ischemic brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and at 1 and 6 months after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> response induced by a heating stimulus was significantly lower on the ipsilateral side to the infarction than on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constant ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000966'>hypohidrosis</z:hpo> was established in 83% of the patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, in 100% at 1 month, and in 76% at 6 months after infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> response were found between medullary and pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000966'>Hypohidrosis</z:hpo> throughout the whole ipsilateral side of the body, a long-lasting phenomenon that has not previously been described, is an essential feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
