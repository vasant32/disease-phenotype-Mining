<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The absence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck impedes the direct application of a clip and endovascular coil deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effects of their treatments, the authors retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of patients with posterior circulation fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated at Stanford University Medical Center between 1991 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-nine patients (mean age 53 years, male/female ratio 1.2:1) treated at the authors' medical center form the basis of the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients presented with an SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients presenting without SAH had cranial nerve dysfunction (five patients), symptoms of mass effect (eight patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (six patients), or unrelated symptoms (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located on the vertebral artery (VA) or posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (21 patients); vertebrobasilar junction (VBJ) or basilar artery (BA) (18 patients); and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) (10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment clinical grades were determined using the Hunt and Hess scale; for patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (Hunt and Hess Grade 0) functional subgrades were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score during a mean follow-up period of 33 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall long-term outcome was good (GOS Score 4 or 5) in 59%, poor (GOS Score 2 or 3) in 16%, and fatal (GOS Score 1) in 24% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis, poor outcome was predicted by age greater than 55 years, VBJ location, pretreatment Hunt and Hess grade in patients presenting with SAH, and incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, age greater than 55 years was the confounding factor predicting poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stratification by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location removed the effect of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of 13 patients with residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after treatment, five (38%) subsequently died of SAH (three patients) or progressive mass effect/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem ischemia</z:e> (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Certain posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> locations (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, VA-PICA, and BA-VBJ) represent separate disease entities affecting patients at different ages with distinct patterns of presentation, treatment options, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Favorable overall long-term outcome can be achieved in 90% of patients with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, in 60% of those with VA-PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and in 39% of those with BA-VBJ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> when using endovascular and surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The natural history of the disease was poor in patients with incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after treatment </plain></SENT>
