<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, as a single event, in the territory of basilar artery (BA) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the findings from computerized tomography (CT) and clinico-radiologic features, the authors propose that this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> entity--the basilar artery (BA) syndrome--can be divided into five subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type 1 (complete type), characterized by infarctions in the whole territory of BA, is incompatible with life; type 2, with extensive brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, may result in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in state</z:e>; and type 3, with infarctions in part of the BA territory (incomplete form or "partial syndrome") may have a more variable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, type 4, with a top of the BA syndrome, and type 5, with negative CT BA syndrome (angiographically verified), are often more benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although initial CT scanning may infrequently be unrevealing, serial and follow-up CT scannings have proven their usefulness in the majority of cases as a noninvasive tool, in contrast to cerebral angiography, for predicting the short-term prognosis of BA syndrome </plain></SENT>
