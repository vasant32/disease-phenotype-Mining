<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied clinical, MRI, and angiographic data of 86 consecutive MMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesions were correlated with clinical findings, and long-term outcomes, divided into mild and severe (modified Rankin scale &gt;3), were assessed by telephone interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Central poststroke pain (CPSP) was defined as persistent pain with visual numeric scale &gt; or = 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lesions were located mostly in the rostral medulla (rostral 76%, rostral+middle 16%), while ventro-dorsal lesion patterns include ventral (V, 20%), ventral+middle (VM, 33%), and ventral+middle+dorsal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VMD</z:e>, 41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations included motor dysfunction in 78 patients (91%), sensory dysfunction in 59 (73%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>/dizziness in 51 (59%), each closely related to involvement of ventral, middle, and dorsal portions, respectively (P&lt;0.001, each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vertebral artery (VA) atherosclerotic disease relevant to the infarction occurred in 53 (62%) patients, mostly producing atheromatous branch occlusion (ABO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) occurred in 24 (28%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ABO was more closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VMD</z:e> (versus V+VM) than was <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (P=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean 71 months), 11 patients died, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Old age (P=0.001) and severe motor dysfunction at admission (P=0.001) were factors predicting poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CPSP, occurring in 21 patients, was closely (P=0.013) related to poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MMI usually presents with a rostral medullary lesion, with a good clinical ventro-dorsal imaging correlation, caused most frequently by ABO followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A significant proportion of patients remain dependent or have CPSP </plain></SENT>
