<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persistence of fetal veins is a rare malformation, and the most common is the persistence of the lateral marginal vein usually observed in patients with Klippel-Trenaunnay Syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The persistence of this embryonic vein as an isolated venous malformation without the other characteristics of the Klippel-Trenaunnay Syndrome has not yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper describes two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients, a 17-year-old male patient and a 16-year-old female, have had since their birth a large venous trunk in the lateral aspect of the right leg and thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The limbs underwent duplex scanning and phlebography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical removal of the lateral marginal vein was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical treatment resulted in very good functional and aesthetic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up at 26 months showed no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicose vein</z:e> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To achieve good results, surgical intervention may be indicated in cases of orthopedic deformity, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, symptomatic, and unaesthetic lesions </plain></SENT>
