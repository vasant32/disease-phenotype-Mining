<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, promising results have been reported using intralesional photocoagulation (ILP) to treat extensive vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the authors' center, they have treated more than 300 patients with vascular anomalies in different parts of the body between 1996 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They describe their operative techniques of ILP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser pulses of a 1,064-nm wavelength from the Nd:YAG laser were delivered to the target tissues with a 600-microm optical fiber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They report 2 patients who developed complications after a single session of ILP therapy for their extensive vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> (capillary-lymphaticovenous malformations) with widespread involvement of her buttocks and left lower limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002153'>hyperkalemia</z:hpo> that resolved with intravenous hydration, antibiotics, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="32139">sodium bicarbonate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In their second patient, the entire left upper limb was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Her total red cell count diminished by a quarter and her <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration dropped by more than 3 g% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was corrected gradually with supplemental oral hematinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although these complications resolved uneventfully in their patients, they hope that their possible development will caution anyone who may wish to attempt this new method of therapy </plain></SENT>
