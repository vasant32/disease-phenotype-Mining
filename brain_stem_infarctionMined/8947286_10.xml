<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL &amp; METHODS: In order to evaluate the effects of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> on autonomic cardiac regulation, we analyzed the power spectrum of heart rate variability in 15 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> and in 15 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The components of the power spectrum which reflect quantitatively both sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular regulatory functions were measured from 24-hour electrocardiogram in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and at 1 month and 6 months after the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the measured components of heart rate variability, i.e., total power (p &lt; 0.01), very-low-frequency power (p &lt; 0.001), low-frequency power (p &lt; 0.01), and high-frequency power (p &lt; 0.05), were significantly lower in the patients with medullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> than in the control subjects in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of the infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By 6 months, these abnormalities had been reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, heart rate variability in pontine brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients did not differ significantly from that in the control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> located in the medulla oblongata causes cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002271'>autonomic dysregulation</z:hpo> manifesting as impaired heart rate variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> seems to cause both sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, which may contribute to the occurrence of cardiac complications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
