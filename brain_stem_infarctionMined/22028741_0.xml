<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Epidermoids are generally recognized as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumors</z:e>; however, total resection is often difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recurrence from the residual capsule, dissemination of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, and aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> are common problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze and report on the clinical characteristics of intracranial epidermoids, particularly complications and cases with a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>24 patients with intracranial epidermoids who were treated surgically at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital between 1997 and 2007 were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The location and size of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, pre-and postoperative symptoms, adherence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to cranial nerves, and proliferative capacity were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent site of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was the cerebello-pontine (C-P) angle (16/24); eight of these patients presented with hearing loss and six presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In many cases, hearing loss and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> persisted after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> epidermoids located in the C-P angle were attached to and/or compressed the trigeminal nerves, therefore, the origin is suggested to be the dura mafer of petrous bone around the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> recurred in four (after 3, 5, 10 and 20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had a poor prognosis, with dissemination and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Epidermoids can recur from residual capsule adhering to the brain stem or cranial nerves up to 10-20 years after the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up imaging studies are required when complete resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> capsule is not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In rare cases, spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> rupture, dissemination, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> result in a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
