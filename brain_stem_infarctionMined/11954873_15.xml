<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our centers, patients with MMI were less than 1% of those with vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> documented by MRI were unilateral in 10 patients and bilateral in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On clinico-topographical analysis there were four clinical patterns: (1) Classical Dejerine's syndrome was the most frequent, consisting of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, lemniscal sensory loss and ipsilateral lingual palsy in 7 of the eleven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was present in 2 patients; (3) Sensorimotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was present in 1 patient with contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, hypesthesia and mild decrease in pain sensation without lingual palsy; (4) Bilateral MMI syndrome in 1 patient, accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo>, bilateral loss of deep sensation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001618'>dysphonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002425'>anarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presumed causes of MMI were intrinsic branch penetrator artery disease with concomitant vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in 6 of the 11 patients, vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 2, dolichoectatic vertebrobasilar arteries in 2, a source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prognosis at 3 months was favorable in 8 patients, but the patient with bilateral MMI syndrome had persisting motor deficit causing limitation of daily activities, and 2 died from systemic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The classical triad of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> MMI facilitates the diagnosis, although the recognition of this syndrome in patients with incomplete manifestations can be difficult and occurs more frequently than commonly thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and branch atheromatous disease of the penetrating arteries are the main causes of medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
