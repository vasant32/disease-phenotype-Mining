<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the long-term survival, cumulative recurrence rate and clinical handicap of patients with isolated pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of different aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with an isolated pontine infarction were identified by imaging studies and evaluated prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After extensive study, cases were classified according to the aetiopathogenetic mechanisms: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to basilar artery branch disease (BABD), small-artery disease (SAD) and large-artery-occlusive disease (LAOD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up period of 46 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation and initial course, early and long-term mortality, disability and recurrence were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BABD was the most frequent cause of isolated pontine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (43%), followed by SAD (34%) and LAOD (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the most prominent risk factor, especially among patients with SAD (94.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological impairment on admission was more severe in the LAOD group, followed by BABD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 1 month patients with LAOD had the highest cumulative mortality (14.3%, p = 0.026) and more severe disability (61.1%, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five-year mortality rate was 20.6%, 14% and 23.8% in the SAD-, BABD- and in LAOD-group respectively (p = 0.776) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cumulative 5-year recurrence rate was 2.3 % for BABD, 14.3 % for LAOD, and 29.4 % for SAD (p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall long-term survival of patients with isolated pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Initial differences regarding short-term outcome in infarctions of different aetiology resolve with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Effective secondary prevention among SAD patients may limit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and positively influence long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
