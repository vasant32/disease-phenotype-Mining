<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> vascular brainstem lesions as identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with isolated R1 pathology were superimposed into a stereotactic anatomical atlas using a new method of digital postprocessing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brainstem lesions were documented by diffusion-weighted MRI in 12 of 24 patients with unilateral R1 pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesions were located in the ipsilateral mid- to lower pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients only, the lesion had partial contact with the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (PSN) on at least one level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the lesion involved the medial longitudinal fasciculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most lesions were located medially and ventrally to the PSN on transverse slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results underline the high localizing value of changes in the R1 component of the blink reflex in patients with ipsilateral pontine functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although available physiological evidence suggests that the R1 component of the blink reflex traverses an oligosynaptic pathway, this MRI study does not support the view that synaptic transmission in the PSN subserves R1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reflex arc probably descends more medially and ventrally on its course to the facial nucleus </plain></SENT>
