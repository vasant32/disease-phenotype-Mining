<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The prevalence and outcome of the most frequent type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in infancy-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> (IS)-are well characterized in the setting of most neurocutaneous disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By contrast, still there is no study describing the natural history of IS in the setting of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two patients with SWS and IS were identified in our series and five in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of study is to evaluate the clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG) and imaging features of our cases and to compare our cases with those described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IS in the setting of SWS is an uncommon but possible event (2/19 patients seen over 13 years in our institutions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We confirmed the correlation between IS and severity of SWS cutaneous and neural (extension of leptomeningeal capillary malformation) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IS in SWS seems to be atypical both from a clinical viewpoint (they are asymmetric) and from a laboratory viewpoint (EEG is not classically hypsarrhythmic) </plain></SENT>
