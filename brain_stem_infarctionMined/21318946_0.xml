<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of bilateral MMI has become possible based on brain MRI findings in recent years, but is still very difficult to diagnose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present case, brain MRI was performed 9 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and the infarcted area was detected only by diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, changes over time were clearly detected by FLAIR-MRI on days 3, 5 and 7, but it is essential to confirm the disease by DW-MRI in the early stage.The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> observed on horizontal MRI sections showed the characteristic "heart appearance" sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For an early diagnosis of bilateral MMI, it is essential to bear in mind that characteristic findings may be obtained by diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
