<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A comparison between long-term sensory sequelae of lateral medullary infarction (LMI) and medial medullary infarction (MMI) has never been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 55 patients with medullary infarction (41 with LMI and 14 with MMI) who were followed up for &gt;6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined and interviewed the patients with the use of a structured format regarding the most important complaints, functional disabilities, and the presence of sensory symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nature and the intensity of sensory symptoms were assessed with the modified McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire and the visual analog scale, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 43 men and 12 women, with an average age of 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up period was 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensory symptoms were the most important residual sequelae in LMI patients and the second most important in MMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In LMI patients, the severity of residual sensory symptoms was significantly related to the initial severity of objective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensory symptoms were most often described by LMI patients as numbness (39%), burning (35%), and cold (22%) in the face, and cold (38%), numbness (29%), and burning (27%) in the body/limbs, whereas they were described as numbness (60%), squeezing (30%) and cold (10%), but never as burning, in their body/limbs by MMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LMI patients significantly (P&lt;0.05) more often cited a cold environment as an aggravating factor for the sensory symptoms than did the MMI patients without spinothalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The subjective sensory symptoms were frequently of a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (up to 6 months) in LMI patients, whereas they usually started immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in MMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that sensory symptoms are major sequelae in both LMI and MMI patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the nature, the mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and aggravating factors are different between the 2 groups, which probably is related to a selective involvement of the spinothalamic tract by the former and the medial lemniscus by the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the mechanisms for the central poststroke pain or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> may differ according to the site of damages on the sensory tracts (spinothalamic tract versus medial lemniscal tract) </plain></SENT>
