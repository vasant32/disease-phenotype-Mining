<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected on clinical and neuroradiological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients included in the study had presented with two or more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the vertebro-basilar territory, related to pathology of the rostral region of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed on CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were found in the thalamus, brain-stem, cerebellum and parieto-occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> of the thalamus associated with another <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in a different region was the most frequent lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CT-MRI findings in the 25 cases were: 14 patients had unilateral thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with another <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 4 patients with bilateral thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 5 with bilateral occipital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients the occipital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was associated with another <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at a different level, and 6 patients each had a cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> together with a brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients the lesions were localized to three or more areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The commonest clinical manifestations were: motor deficit (68%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>abnormal eye movements</z:hpo> (48%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar dysfunction</z:e> (40%), alteration of the level of consciousness (32%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> (20%), pupil anomalies (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk factors most frequently associated were: arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (64%), a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (28%), smoking (28%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (24%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unlike the classical descriptions, motor deficit was the most frequent symptom in our series </plain></SENT>
