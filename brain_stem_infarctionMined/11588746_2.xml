<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A rehabilitation unit in a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients (n = 563) admitted to a tertiary care hospital over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> videofluoroscopic modified <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> swallow (VMBS) studies was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For patients with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tube, the following were recorded: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> location; results of subsequent VMBS reports; length of time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tube insertion; total time the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tube remained in situ; discharge disposition; and concurrent feeding status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was at 1-year poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications during the inpatient stay attributable to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tube were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 563 (5.7%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted and 28 of the 115 (24.3%) proven aspirators, as shown on VMBS studies, had a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tube inserted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of the 563 (3.7%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were discharged to the community with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tubes in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The tubes were inserted on average 37 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 88 (19.3%) brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 15 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 29 (51.7%) brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> had feeding tubes inserted, whereas only 15 of 475 (3.2%) hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation patients received a tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 32 (34.3%) patients with a feeding tube were able to resume oral feedings at discharge; within 1 year of discharge, 24 of 32 (75%) had done so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although there were no serious complications resulting from tube insertions, minor complications were documented in more than 50% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The tubes were associated with prolonged institutionalization in only 1 case; most patients were discharged on a home tube-feeding program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26346">PGJ</z:chebi> feeding tubes were placed in approximately 1 of every 20 of our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rehabilitation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>One third of the tubes were removed before the patients were discharged from rehabilitation and 75% were removed within 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Insertion of the tubes was most common in patients with evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and in patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Complications caused by the tube were minor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but 1 who were discharged with feeding tubes were able to manage the home tube-feeding program </plain></SENT>
