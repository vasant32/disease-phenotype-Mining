<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss the operative technique, advantage and postoperative complications in 41 patients with giant petroclival <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> treated with the supra- and infratentorial transpetrousal presigmoid approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data were obtained from the review of charts and radiographic images of the 41 patients after operation with temporo-occipotal free osseous flap, partial petrosectomy and mastoidectomy were performed around the labyrinth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The semicircular canals, cochlea and tympanic cavity were protected during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the super petrous was ligated and cut off, the petroclival region in front of the sigmoid sinus was exposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 41 patients 20 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, 20 epidermoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100008'>schwannoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total resection was performed in 34 patients, subtotal resection in 16, and greater partial resection in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major postoperative complications included temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (10 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (6), brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (2), IIIth, VIIth, VIth and posterial group <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsies</z:hpo> (16, 16, 8, 6 respectively), and cerebrospinal fluid leakage (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This approach can expose sufficiently the petroclival region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can also reveal the area of adjacent sella, interpeduncular and formen magnum, and homolateral III-XIIth cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative complications may be related to operative techniues and tumorous characteristics </plain></SENT>
