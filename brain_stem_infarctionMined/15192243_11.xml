<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between BA-VS and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with posterior circulation after aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements of posterior and anterior circulation arteries were conducted in 162 patients with aneurysmal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF to the brain stem (BS) and other brain territories was assessed by multiple single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography with (99m)Tc ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>-SPECT) imaging during the course of VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SPECT imaging showed delayed BS hypoperfusion in 29 patients (17.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of them, 23 patients (79.3%) were found to have BA-VS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with very high BA flow velocities (FVs; &gt;115 cm/s) had a 50% chance of developing delayed BS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BA-VS was found at a higher rate in patients who experienced reduced rCBF in the cerebellum (56.3%), thalamic nuclei (68.4%), and occipital lobe (81.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although patients with delayed BS hypoperfusion did not present with a higher clinical grade, their clinical outcome was significantly worse (Glasgow Outcome Score after 30 days 2.48+/-1.16 versus 3.3+/-1.27; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest for the first time that BA-VS after aneurysmal SAH is associated with hypoperfusion to BS and other posterior circulation territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk for delayed BS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> increased significantly when TCD BA-FVs were &gt;115 cm/s </plain></SENT>
