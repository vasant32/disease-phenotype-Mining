<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 had paroxysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, and was tested "on" and "off." The HV was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> "on" and "off" but the VV was severely tilted during vestibular paroxysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient 2, with a brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, was tested at months 1 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VV was severely tilted on both occasions (&gt;12 degrees) but the HV was marginally tilted (4 degrees) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These VV-HV dissociations suggest that vestibular nuclear lesions influence gravity perception mostly via ocular torsional effects rather than by disrupting a single, internal representation of verticality </plain></SENT>
