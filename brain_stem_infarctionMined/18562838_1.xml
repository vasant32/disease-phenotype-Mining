<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe this to be the first report of WEBINO in PSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The preservation of vestibulo-ocular horizontal eye movements supports the notion that the WEBINO in this condition was caused by a supranuclear rather than a nuclear lesion and suggests the possibility that even in other causes of WEBINO, the lesion is supranuclear and not in the medial rectus subnucleus as is often suggested </plain></SENT>
