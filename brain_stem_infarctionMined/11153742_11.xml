<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>Autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> leads to disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particularly in primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo>, repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and immobilization can be the result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> often fails in advanced cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ambulatory, patient-controlled <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> therapy was initiated in six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> due to primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> that had been refractory to conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before this therapy, three patients were bedridden; one was immobilized in a wheelchair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and tolerated upright tilt-table testing for less than 15 min despite extensive medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For ambulatory treatment, a port-a-cath system was implanted and, using a CADD ambulatory infusion pump, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> was infused in individually adjusted dosages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi> infusion therapy enabled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to sit, stay and walk around for more than 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died after a five-year treatment period, another after nine months because of nonhemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e>, both in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001743'>absence of norepinephrine</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The remaining four patients are still mobile after a period of 19, 10, 9 and 7 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of them has suffered complications due to arterial hypo- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and there has been no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the infusion system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these selected patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> due to primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo>, ambulatory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> infusion therapy has proved to be a promising new therapeutic option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further long-term studies including more patients are necessary to assess additional indications, reliability and safety of this new method </plain></SENT>
