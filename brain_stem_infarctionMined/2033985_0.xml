<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We carried out a prospective clinical study in 100 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> (Cl) (56 lacunar and 44 nonlacunar infarctions) and in a control group (n = 100) without organic cerebrovascular disease to evaluate the electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>72% of the Cl and 38% of the control group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> (p less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were significantly more common (p less than 0.001) at the beginning of the disease (72%) than three weeks after the development of focal neurological symptoms (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major ECG findings were abnormal ventricular repolarization (changes in the ST segment and the T wave), prolonged Q-Tc interval, and U waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>Atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> was significantly more common (p less than 0.03) in nonlacunar infarctions (18%) than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> (2%) and in the control group (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regarding the topography of the lesions, abnormalities of ECG were found in 80% of hemispheric infarctions, in 66% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of basal ganglia, and in 73% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cl, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They may be reversible, and some of them are usually correlated with the type of Cl and with the involved brain topography </plain></SENT>
