<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the results of non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out a retrospective case series analysis of patients who underwent NPDS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with SWS between 1998 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> after NPDS, the results of surgery on intraocular pressure, the need for additional medical treatment and surgical complications were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve eyes of nine patients, aged 11 days to 24 years, underwent filtering surgery: nine NPDS procedures were performed and three surgical procedures had to be converted to trabeculectomy because NPDS was not technically achievable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up after surgery was 26.3 months (range 6-48 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two trabeculectomies were complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal effusion</z:e>, which resolved in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> was obtained during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Non-penetrating deep sclerectomy is transiently efficient in the treatment of SWS-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies of NPDS for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with SWS are warranted </plain></SENT>
