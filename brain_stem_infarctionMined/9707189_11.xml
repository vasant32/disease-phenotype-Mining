<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Questionnaires to elicit symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) may detect late-life transient visual symptoms similar to the visual aura of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, often without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the frequency, characteristics, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome of these symptoms in the Framingham Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 1971-1989, at biennial examinations, 2110 subjects of the Framingham cohort were systematically queried about the occurrence of sudden visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Visual migrainous symptoms were reported by 1.23% (26/2110) of subjects (1.33% of women and 1.08% of men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 65% of subjects the episodes were stereotyped, and they began after age 50 years in 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean +/- SD age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the episodes was 56.2+/-18.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 58% of subjects the episodes were never accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, and 42% had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of episodes ranged from 1 to 500 and was 10 or more in 69% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The episodes lasted 15 to 60 minutes in 50% of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five percent of the subjects were examined by a study neurologist, and only 19% of them met the criteria of the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve percent of subjects sustained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of migrainous visual symptoms: a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> 1 year later, an atherothrombotic brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 3 years later, and a cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 27 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, of 87 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in the same cohort, 33% developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = 0.030), two thirds within 6 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Late-life-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> transient visual phenomena similar to the visual aura of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> are not rare and often occur in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These symptoms appear not to be associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and invasive diagnostic procedures or therapeutic measures are generally not indicated </plain></SENT>
