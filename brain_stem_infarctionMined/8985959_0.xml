<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The left carotid artery was resected and anastomosed to the right side in an end-to-side fashion to create a half-ring bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distal side of the bypass was regarded as a union of VAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the geometry, histology and hemodynamics in the union were investigated after the recipient artery was ligated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intimal thickening was most prominently observed in the recipient arterial segment distal to the ligation site, where the lumen was obliterated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the portion of the lumen within 2.6 +/- 0.6 (mean +/- s.d.) mm, a distance of 2.9 +/- 0.6 times the internal diameter from the union, was not obliterated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angle of the union was positively related to the length of this residual lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study explain some of the pathogenesis in unsuccessful aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> after therapeutic unilateral VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
