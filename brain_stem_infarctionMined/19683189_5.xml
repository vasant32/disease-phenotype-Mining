<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, concerns have been raised that laser obliteration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> may result in ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to review clinical features and management of ocular complications of SWS and assess the effects of dermatological laser treatment on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> or ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in an institutional setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had involvement of the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent skin laser to the port-wine vascular malformation were analyzed further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ocular involvement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, and skin laser treatment and the relationship to ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> patients with port-wine vascular malformation were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was observed in 24 patients (58.5%) at mean age of 2.9 years (range, 0.0-16.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of these, 18 (75.0%) were treated with medical therapy, and 10 (41.7%) required trabeculectomy, with 2 of these requiring Seton implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 41 patients, 28 (68.3%) underwent laser to face/forehead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mean age of laser commencement was 5 years (range, 0.4-16.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirteen did not undergo laser treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 28 and 10 of the 13 developed ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective review did not find evidence to suggest that laser treatment of port-wine vascular malformations causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> or that it can worsen a preexisting ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was inconclusive </plain></SENT>
