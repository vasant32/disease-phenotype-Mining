<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The use of flow-diverting stents has gained momentum as a curative approach in the treatment of complex proximal anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been some reported attempts of treating formidable lesions in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Posterior circulation giant fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have a particularly aggressive natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, no one approach has been shown to be comprehensively effective or low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors report the initial results, including the significant morbidity and mortality encountered, with flow diversion in the treatment of large or giant fusiform vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at Millard Fillmore Gates Circle Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed their prospectively collected endovascular database to identify patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> who underwent treatment with flow-diverting devices and determined that 7 patients had presented with symptomatic large or giant fusiform vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of these patients, based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), were tabulated, as were the complications experienced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 7 patients, Pipeline devices were placed in 6 patients and Silk devices in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up evaluation, 4 patients had died (mRS score of 6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were treated with the Pipeline device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other 3 patients had mRS scores of 5 (severe disability), 1, and 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> included posttreatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ruptures in 2 patients and lack of improvement in neurological status related to presenting brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and subsequent withdrawal of care in the other 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Whether flow diversion will be an effective strategy for treatment of large or giant fusiform vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remains to be seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors' initial experience suggests substantial morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment and with the natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>As outcomes data slowly become available for patients receiving these devices for fusiform posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, practitioners should use these devices judiciously </plain></SENT>
