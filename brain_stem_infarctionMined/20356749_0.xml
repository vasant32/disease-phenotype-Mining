<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a 77-year-old man with spontaneous regression of an anterior skull base mass suspected to be an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IMT">inflammatory pseudotumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient attended our outpatient department approximately once per month for a regular check-up following a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A small mass was detected at the anterior skull base by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mass gradually grew to about 3 cm over a period of 5 years and then remained stable for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the mass showed spontaneous regression 8 years after it was first visible on MRI. '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334121" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="IMT">Inflammatory pseudotumor</z:e>' is a broad category and the natural history of these lesions is highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the definition does include some types of malignant lesion, most masses are benign lesions that can regress spontaneously, as in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 'wait-and-see' policy is appropriate for such patients </plain></SENT>
