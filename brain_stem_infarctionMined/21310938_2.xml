<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> in internal organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients show severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo>, both of which notably interfere with their quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are two predominant types of HHT caused by mutations in endoglin (ENG) and ACVRL1/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) genes, named HHT1 and HHT2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ENG and ALK1 code for proteins involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 signaling pathway, and it is widely accepted that HHT pathogenicity results from haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cure for HHT has been found, so identification of drugs able to increase the expression of these genes is essential when proposing new therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report the efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) in increasing ENG and ALK1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rationale comes from a case report of a patient with HHT who received a liver transplantation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0006574'>liver arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The liver was transplanted, and the immunosuppressor FK506 was used to prevent the rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the first month of FK506 treatment, the internal and external <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo>, epistaxes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Here, we find that the immunosuppressor FK506 increases the protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of ENG and ALK1 in cultured endothelial cells and enhances the TGF-β1/ALK1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like tubulogenesis and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the mechanism of action of FK506 involves a partial correction of endoglin and ALK1 haploinsufficiency and may therefore be an interesting drug for use in patients with HHT who undergo transplantation </plain></SENT>
