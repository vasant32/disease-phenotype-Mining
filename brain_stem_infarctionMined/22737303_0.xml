<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report two cases of wide necked basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which were not amenable to stent assisted coiling, that were treated using the waffle-cone technique with a Solitaire AB stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old woman presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain CT showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and angiography demonstrated a ruptured giant basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000475'>broad neck</z:hpo>, which was treated with a Solitaire AB stent and coils using the waffle-cone technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case involved an 81-year-old man, who presented with dizziness caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography also demonstrated a large basilar bifurcation unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000475'>broad neck</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Solitaire AB stent deployment using the waffle-cone technique, followed by coiling resulted in near complete obliteration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The waffle-cone technique with a Solitaire AB stent can be a useful alternative to conventional stent application when it is difficult to catheterize bilateral posterior cerebral arteries in patients with a wide-necked basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
