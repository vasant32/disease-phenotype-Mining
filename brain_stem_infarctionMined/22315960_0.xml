<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Design: 38 individuals between the ages of 12 and 61 with such CFCs as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, Treacher Collins <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221060" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syndrome, Moebius</z:e> syndrome, <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> and palate, Noonan syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002636" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">amniotic band syndrome</z:e> participated in semi-structured video-recorded interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were recruited at conferences, through study flyers, and by word of mouth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Descriptive, thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to reconstructive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Dominant themes included undergoing surgery to reduce stigmatization, the psychological and social implications of the interventions, outcome satisfaction, parental involvement in decision-making about surgery, and recommendations for parents considering surgery for their children with CFCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Experiences with reconstructive surgery varied, with some participants expressing surgical benefits and others disillusionment </plain></SENT>
