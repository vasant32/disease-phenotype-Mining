<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient having '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">top of the basilar syndrome</z:e>' with midbrain infarction selectively involving the bilateral oculomotor nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 61-year-old woman with two episodes of vertebrobasilar infarction presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001488'>bilateral ptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Examination revealed pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001488'>bilateral ptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the primary position, fixation of either eye produced an approximately 50 prism diopter <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adduction of the right eye was restricted to the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was moderately decreased adduction of the left eye, severe limitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and moderately decreased elevation of both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abduction of both eyes was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001488'>Bilateral ptosis</z:hpo> is suggestive of oculomotor nuclear palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical findings alone, we could not establish whether the precise location of the lesion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subdivisions of the oculomotor nucleus except the Edinger-Westphal nucleus or the central caudal nucleus and bilateral fascicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, because axial MRI showed a small midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the oculomotor nucleus region, we concluded that she had an isolated, pupil-sparing, bilateral oculomotor nuclear palsy caused by midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
