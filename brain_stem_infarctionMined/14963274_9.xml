<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate them through the use of cooperatively collected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from 1996 to 2000 with medullary infarction (MI) proven by brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images at 35 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers in the Tohoku district, Japan, was collected, and their clinical and radiological features were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 214 cases of MI were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They included 167 cases (78%) of LMI, 41 (19%) of MMI, and 6 (3%) of LMI plus MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and the male-to-female ratio were 60.7 years and 2.7:1 in LMI and 65.0 years and 3.6:1 in MMI, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middle medulla was most frequently affected in LMI, and the upper medulla was most frequently affected in MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the vertebral artery was observed in 29% of LMI and 21% of MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prognosis, assessed by the Barthel Index, was favorable in both LMI and MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was more frequently associated with MMI than with LMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study surveyed a large number of MI cases and revealed that (1) the mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of MMI is higher than that of LMI, (2) the dissection of the vertebral artery is an important cause not only of LMI but also of MMI, and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is frequently associated with MMI </plain></SENT>
