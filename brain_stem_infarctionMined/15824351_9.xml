<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> limited to the midbrain were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI and angiography (mostly <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography) were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> in 27 (68%) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> in 22 (55%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002070'>limb ataxia</z:hpo> in 20 (50%), sensory symptoms in 17 (43%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">third nerve palsy</z:e> in 14 (35%), definitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limb weakness</z:hpo> (&lt; or =IV/V) in nine (23%), and internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> in five (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to MRI findings, the lesions were categorized into four groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anteromedial group (n = 18) was characterized by oculomotor disturbances (89%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (89%, bilateral in 17%), and sensory changes (39%) usually restricted to the perioral and hand areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesions restricted to the subcortical area (n = 10) were usually related to small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) (78%), whereas those involving the medial surface (n = 8) were caused by large vessel disease (LVD) (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The anterolateral group (n = 11) was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (70%) and definitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (30%) usually caused by LVD (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined group (n = 6) had frequent oculomotor disturbances (83%), definitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (67%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (50%) and was usually associated with LVD (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lateral group (n = 2) was characterized by prominent sensory symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was generally good except for one patient with a bilateral lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical-radiologic correlation study yields four distinct subgroups: anteromedial, anterolateral, combined, and lateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Large vessel disease and small vessel disease are usual pathogenic mechanisms, whereas cardiogenic embolism is rare </plain></SENT>
