<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features, MRI findings, and pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> producing internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> (INO) as an isolated or predominant clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients presenting with INO without (n = 12) or with (n = 18) minimal other neurologic signs were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI and angiogram (conventional in 3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram in 27) studies were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four presented with INO, whereas six initially presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e> that changed into INO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dorsal brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> responsible for the INO were located in the caudal pons in 4, rostral pons in 8, rostral pons and isthmus in 2, isthmus area in 14, isthmus and midbrain in 1, and midbrain in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesions were found in the posterior circulation in 14 patients (47%): at the basilar artery (BA) in 4, superior cerebellar artery (SCA) in 4, posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) in 4, and both the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and the SCA in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The INO eventually disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, tending to last longer (p = 0.05) when it was associated with other neurologic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolated or predominant INO is a unique clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome caused by small dorsal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis, however, is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, including distal occlusion of small penetrating arteries, atheromatous branch occlusion from the BA, SCA, or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>, or major BA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The functional prognosis of these patients is excellent, although the INO tends to last longer when there are other neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
