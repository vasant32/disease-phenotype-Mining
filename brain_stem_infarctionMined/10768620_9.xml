<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> as a symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and its apparent sequela, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo>, are common consequences of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports that focused on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> due to a medullary lesion were studies of single cases or a relatively small number of patients with multiple lesion loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the evaluation time of swallowing was not controlled and varied largely among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, prediction of the swallowing status of patients with a medullary lesion has not been tenable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relation between the loci of pure medullary lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, to examine swallowing function over time, and to explore clinical variables that can predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 23 patients with pure medullary infarctions using the videofluoroscopic swallowing study and compared the airway status findings with the lesion location as determined with magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified by 6 medullary lesion-level categories (lower, lower-middle, middle, lower-middle-upper, middle-upper, and upper) and by 5 intralevel lesion loci (inferior-dorsal, large inferior-dorsolateral, para-median, midlateral, and dorsolateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the results of the videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, 2 patient groups were formed: one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and the other without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical variables related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and outcome measures were also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten (44%) of the 23 patients manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> on swallowing: 9 (69%) of 13 with only middle-level lesions or lesions in multilevels, including the middle level; 1 (33%) of 3 with only upper-level lesions; and 0 (0%) of 7 with only lower-level medullary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A lesion running the length of the middle and the lower medullary levels always resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>When an upper-level lesion was additionally involved, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> depended on the horizontal extension of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We were able to discriminate the 2 patient groups with 95.7% accuracy using such variables as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001618'>dysphonia</z:hpo>, soft palate dysfunction, and facial hypesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> symptoms due to a pure medullary infarction recovered rather quickly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Medullary infarctions often cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, but the occurrence may depend on the levels along the neuraxis and intralevel lesion loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>When different lesion levels and loci and their related clinical findings are considered as possible variables, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> becomes predictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The outcome data prove that systematic control of evaluation time of swallowing was critical as we engaged in this study, since many aspirators with pure medullary infarctions resolve their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>swallowing difficulties</z:hpo> rather quickly </plain></SENT>
