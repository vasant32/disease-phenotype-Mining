<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the central corneal thickness (CCT) of children with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and to estimate the effect CCT may have on the intraocular pressure (IOP) assessment of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: CCT and IOP measurements were performed in an unmasked fashion in 34 consecutive children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and 28 consecutive children without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with corneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000559'>corneal scarring</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IOPs in the pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> group were corrected for CCT using a linear algorithm; adjustments of 3 mm Hg or more were considered clinically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean CCT for eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> was 610.2+/-121.9 microm; for the control eyes, mean CCT was 555.6+/-38.4 microm (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean CCT was 543.3+/-66.9 microm for eyes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008007'>primary congenital glaucoma</z:hpo>, 591.9+/-23.1 pm for those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, 662.7+/-68.7 microm for those with aphakic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, 754.5 +/-92.6 microm for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, and 820.6+/-133.7 microm for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000482'>microcornea</z:hpo> (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Applying a correction formula for IOP with CCT adjustment, the adjusted IOP was overestimated by &gt; or =3 mm Hg in 14 (41.2%) eyes and underestimated by &gt; or = 3 mm Hg in 5 (14.7%) eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The mean CCT was higher for the pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> group than for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the CCTs varied significantly depending on the specific diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CCT was estimated to have a clinically significant effect on IOP measurements in more than half of the patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pachymetry results should be considered in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
