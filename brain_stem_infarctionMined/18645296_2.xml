<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is little information available regarding gait-training interventions for people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> who are nonambulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this case report is to describe the feasibility and outcome of three different task-oriented gait-training techniques in an individual with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> who was not able to ambulate independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: The participant was a 61-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> resulting from five brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> sustained over five years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He maintained home and community mobility with a power wheelchair but sought to ambulate home and short community distances without assistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three six-week gait-training interventions were implemented sequentially twice per week: (1) overground gait training with manual assistance, (2) body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT), and (3) overground gait training with variable task practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME: Independent home and short community ambulation was not achieved by this individual after these interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, he improved gait speed and endurance as well as balance over the 18-week intervention period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: There appeared to be no advantage to BWSTT over traditional gait training for this individual, as improvement was noted during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three interventions at a comparable rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although these gait-training interventions facilitated gains in gait and balance measures during the treatment, no change in functional ambulation status was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Given the time, financial, and labor demands involved with BWSTT and the lack of apparent benefit, traditional overground therapeutic intervention was reasonable and appropriate for this participant with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
