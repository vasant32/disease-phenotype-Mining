<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is caused by mutations of two genes: ENG and ALK1 (ACVRL1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened the coding sequence of ENG and ALK1 in 160 unrelated French index cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A germline mutation was identified in 100 individuals (62.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 36 mutations were found in ENG, including three nonsense mutations, 19 small insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift, two inframe deletions, seven missense mutations, and five intronic or splice-site mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 mutations, 33 were novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 64 mutations were found in ALK1, including six nonsense mutations, 28 small insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift, one inframe deletion, 27 missense mutations, and two intronic or splice-site mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 64 mutations, 27 were novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations were found in most parts of the coding sequence for both genes, except ALK1 exon 5 and ENG exons 12 to 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Missense mutations in ALK1 were more frequent in exons 7, 8, and 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ENG cDNA was sequenced for three intronic mutations: c.689+2T&gt;C produced an abnormal transcript excluding exon 5, c.1103+3_1103+8del activated a cryptic splice site 22 bp upstream, and c.1428G&gt;A produced two abnormal transcripts, one including intron 11 and the other excluding exon 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although most of the mutations were private, some recurrent mutations in ALK1 were of particular interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mutation c.1112_1113dupG (p.Gly371fsX391) was found in 17 unrelated individuals sharing a common haplotype, strongly suggesting a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect related to the concentration of patients previously reported in a specific French region (Rh√¥ne-Alpes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three missense mutations involved the same codon: c.1231C&gt;T (p.Arg411Trp), c.1232G&gt;C (p.Arg411Pro), and c.1232G&gt;A (p.Arg411Gln) were found in seven, two, and one patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis was in favor of both a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect and a mutation hot-spot </plain></SENT>
