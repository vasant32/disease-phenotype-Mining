<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of brain myelination conforms to a fixed chronological sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal accelerated myelination is a usual pathological state and previously has only been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study is to describe alternate causes for accelerated myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scans, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, conventional angiography and the clinical progress of three children with accelerated myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with accelerated myelination had an underlying cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study strongly suggests that <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> with the consequent restriction of venous outflow could be a key factor in the induction of accelerated myelination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend that in patients with accelerated myelination, the search for an underlying etiology should include careful evaluation of the intracranial vascular pathology, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
