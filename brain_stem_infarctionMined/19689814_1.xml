<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: No large study has compared the yield of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with clinical examination in order to differentiate lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This differentiation is important for guiding further investigations and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients admitted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were classified according to the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on DWI and CT <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was classified as lacunar (LI) and non-lacunar (NLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesion &lt;1.5 cm and located in subcortex or in brainstem were classified as LI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other infarctions were classified as NLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI was performed in 419 (69%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients with lacunar syndrome (LACS) 45 (40.5%) had NLI on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with total anterior syndrome (TACS) and 144 (88.3%) with partial anterior syndrome (PACS) had NLI on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DWI is important among patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of lacunar syndrome to differentiate between LI and NLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there is good correspondence between TACS or PACS and NLI on DWI </plain></SENT>
