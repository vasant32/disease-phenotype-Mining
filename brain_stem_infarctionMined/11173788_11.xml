<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies of the function of ANS in patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the function of ANS in the early period after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to find out whether the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in brainstem influences the function of ANS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied heart rate variability (HRV) and plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> in 14 eligible patients with medullary (6 patients) and non-medullary (8 patients) brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the first 6 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Integrals over the low- (LFB; 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency bands (HFB; 0.15-0.40 Hz) of power spectra were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared to controls, the integrals over HFB in the hyperacute (p &lt; 0.001) and over LFB in the hyperacute (p &lt; 0.005) and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) phases were significantly smaller in patients with medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Integrals over LFB and HFB in patients with non-medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> did not differ significantly from controls, regardless of the phase of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> in patients with non-medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the hyperacute and in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phases were significantly higher than in controls (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that there is transient dysfunction of ANS in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> medullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in contrast to those with non-medullary brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
