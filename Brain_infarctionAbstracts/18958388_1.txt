Intra-arterial Nimodipine administration can be an effective alternative to papaverine or balloon angioplasty for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm refractory to medical therapy. It has been used for intractable vasospasm due to aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) with convincing results and no significant complications in small case series. This report describes of a patient with symptomatic and angiographically documented vasospasm following traumatic SAH which was refractory to maximal medical therapy and successfully treated with intra-arterial infusion of Nimodipine. This first reported technical note is with special reference to the nimodipine administration modalities, clinical and neuroradiological criteria of selection as well as the follow up of the patient.
