Unilateral thalamic infarction is a rare condition in adults. This is a case report of a young child presenting with left-sided hemiparesis of sudden onset due to an unilateral venous thalamic infarction. This was attributed to an asymmetric thrombosis of the cerebral internal veins, a partial thrombosis of the vein of Galen and straight sinus. Magnetic resonance imaging resulted primarily in the differential diagnosis of a cerebral tumor or an intracerebral abscess, leading to stereotactic puncture. Subsequent magnetic resonance venography facilitated the correct diagnosis. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia necessitated anticoagulation treatment with hirudin and later, warfarin. The patient made a complete recovery. We conclude that unclear unilateral thalamic lesions might be symptomatic of a cerebral deep venous thrombosis and might mimic a thalamic tumor. In uncertain cases, we suggest rapid performance of magnetic resonance angiography.
