BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report a case of intravenous thrombolysis in a patient with early recurrent stroke. A 62-year-old man recovered nearly completely after a lacunar infarct of the left putamen. He suffered stroke recurrence 7 days later due to a new infarct in the left internal capsule. Intravenous alteplase 0.9 mg/kg was administered 40 min after the symptom onset resulting in significant neurologic improvement. CONCLUSION: Intravenous thrombolysis may be safe for early recurrent lacunar stroke in patients with relatively small risk of hemorrhage.
