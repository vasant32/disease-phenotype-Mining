Posterior occipital and parietal lobe infarcts shown by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging have been associated with eclampsia. Gray-white matter, infarct-like lesions of the right basal ganglia, right posterior parietal, and left posterior parieto-occipital lobes were found by CT scan in a patient at 26 weeks gestation with severe preeclampsia and neurologic deficits. A magnetic resonance image taken 3 days postpartum had similar abnormalities, despite total resolution of the patient's symptomatology. A repeat CT scan performed 6 weeks postpartum showed complete resolution of the multiple infarctions. This is a unique case report that describes these severe brain-imaging findings in a patient with severe preeclampsia and neurologic deficits.
