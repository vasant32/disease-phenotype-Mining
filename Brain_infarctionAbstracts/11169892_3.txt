Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by a proliferation of histiocytic cells resembling the integumentary cells bearing the name of Langerhans cells. LCH can be unifocal or multifocal, with one- or many-organ involvement. We present a case of LCH diagnosed in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with generalized lymphadenopathy and central nervous system involvement.
