The mitogen-activated protein kinase organizer 1 (Morg1) has been recently identified as modular scaffold regulating ERK signaling. Morg1 also attenuates expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by activating or stabilizing of prolyl-hydroxylase 3 (PHD3). Here we demonstrate for the first time that Morg1 is expressed in the human brain in neurons, glial cells, and blood vessel walls. Immunohistochemistry, RT real-time PCR and western blotting indicated that Morg1 expression is reduced in human brain tissue with ischemic damage. Moreover, reactive astrocytes in the surrounding brain tissue showed strong Morg1 expression. Since hypoxic adaptation with enhancing HIF-1alpha expression can engage a genetic program leading to profound sparing of brain tissue and enhanced recovery of function, down-regulation of Morg1 expression in the ischemic brain may be viewed as an intrinsic mechanism to stimulate this response. On the other hand, upregulation of Morg1 in astrocytes surrounding the penumbra may counteract this hypoxic adaptation.
