Our previous study showed that kainate (KA) receptor subunit GluR6 played an important role in ischemia-induced MLK3 and JNK activation and neuronal degeneration through the GluR6-PSD95-MLK3 signaling module. However, whether the KA receptors subunit GluR6 is involved in the activation of p38 MAP kinase during the transient brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in the rat hippocampal CA1 subfield is still unknown. In this present study, we first evaluated the time-course of phospho-p38 MAP kinase at various time-points after 15 min of ischemia and then observed the effects of antagonist of KA receptor subunit GluR6, GluR6 antisence oligodeoxynucleotides on the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase induced by I/R. Results showed that inhibiting KA receptor GluR6 or suppressing the expression of KA receptor GluR6 could down-regulate the elevation of phospho-p38 MAP kinase induced by I/R. These drugs also reduced the phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK3/MKK6, MKK4, and MAPKAPK2. Additionally, our results indicated administration of three drugs, including p38 MAP kinase inhibitor before brain ischemia significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells detected at 3 days of reperfusion and increased the number of the surviving CA1 pyramidal cells at 5 days of reperfusion after 15 min of ischemia. Taken together, we suggest that GluR6-contained KA receptors can mediate p38 MAP kinase activation through a kinase cascade, including MLK3, MKK3/MKK6, and MKK4 and then induce increased phosphorylation of MAPKAPK-2 during ischemia injury and ultimately result in neuronal cell death in the rat hippocampal CA1 region.
