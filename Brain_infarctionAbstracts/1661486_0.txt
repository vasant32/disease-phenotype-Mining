The concentration of cerebral isoenzyme of creatine kinase was measured repeatedly in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 84 patients with ischemic disorders of brain circulation. Of these, 14 patients presented with transitory ischemic attacks, 20 patients with regressing deficit, and 50 with brain infarction. The patients' health status and functional capacities were estimated on discharge from the hospital. It was discovered that in each patient, the maximum level of cerebral isoenzyme in the CSF was in a good agreement with the clinical course of the disease and neurological status in the survived patients. It may be concluded that measurements of the concentration of the enzyme in the CSF makes it possible to draw more valid prognostic conclusions in patients with ischemic disorders of brain circulation.
