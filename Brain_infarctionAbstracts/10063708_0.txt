BACKGROUND: Stroke has been the second most common cause of death, after cancer, in Taiwan since 1983. The cost of stroke to society in terms of morbidity, mortality and economics is profound. Heightened interest in the early diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke challenges neuroimagers to optimize available modalities and to develop new techniques for the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in conjunction with spin-echo imaging in patients with acute brain infarction of the anterior circulation. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional Fourier transformed time-of-flight MRA studies, performed on 50 patients within one week after the onset of cerebral ischemia, were retrospectively reviewed and correlated with clinical records. Five of the 50 MRAs were considered nondiagnostic and excluded because of poor patient cooperation. RESULTS: In 41 of the 45 cases, the area of infarct corresponding to the clinical deficit at the time of study was identified on T2-weighted spin-echo images. Arterial occlusions or severe stenoses that corresponded to ischemic manifestations were identified with MRA in 37 of the 45 patients. A focal discontinuity with decreased arterial caliber corresponded to stenosis and nonvisualization of distal branches represented arterial occlusion. MRA provided information for 23 cases not obtained from the MR images. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular lesions demonstrated on intracranial MRA show a high correlation with infarct distribution. MRA, which provides information adjunctive to conventional MR imaging in a majority of cases, is concluded to be an important component of the complete evaluation of brain infarction.
