 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to search for differences between clinical characteristics of recurrent ischaemic stroke which occurred within the fifth year after the first event or later, and early recurrence, i.e. within the first year after first-ever ischaemic stroke. We also tried to determine prognostic factors of late recurrent ischaemic episodes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups: group I comprised 124 individuals with recurrence within the first year, and group II - 98 individuals in whom the recurrent episode appeared within the fifth year or later. RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of patients in group I demonstrated evident stenosis (70% or more) of internal carotid artery ipsilateral to stroke (p = 0.023). In this group more cardioembolic strokes were found compared to group II, while in the latter, predominantly lacunar strokes appeared (p = 0.046 and 0.0002, respectively). Group II patients significantly more frequently reported acetylsalicylic acid application, including systematic drug use (p = 0.001). No evident differences were found between groups considering other important non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Small differences between risk factors of ischaemic stroke profiles in patients with early and late recurrent episodes do not allow us to distinguish unequivocally a group of patients with better prognosis regarding the time of recurrent stroke. Use of antiplatelet drugs, either systematic or non-systematic, and lacunar stroke are independent, positive prognostic factors of delay of potential recurrent stroke.
