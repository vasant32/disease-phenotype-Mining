A 40-year-old diabetic woman was diagnosed with rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Cerebral mucormycosis is an acute life-threatening disease, which is caused by fungi of the class Phycomycetae. Clinical suspicion and detection of the fungal hyphae in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) led to early diagnosis, subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis of fungal RNA. Early infiltration of the infectious agent into the central nervous system resulted in septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, mycotic meningoencephalitis, brain infarctions as well as intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhages. Despite immediate high-dose antimycotic treatment, surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, and control of diabetes as a predisposing factor, the woman died 2 weeks after admission. Although fungal organisms are rarely detectable in CSF specimens from patients with mycotic infections of the central nervous system, comprehensive CSF examination is beneficial in the diagnosis of rhinocerebral mucormycosis. Furthermore, a concerted team approach, systemic antifungal agents and early surgical intervention seem to be crucial for preventing rapid disease progression.
