The methionine analogue methionine sulfoximine was administered to 10 rats 24 hours before occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral artery. Three days later the rats were decapitated and the brain infarct volumes were compared with those in 10 control rats that received saline before middle cerebral artery occlusion. The mean volume of the infarct in the cerebral cortex was reduced by 33% in the group treated with methionine sulfoximine (p less than 0.01). This protective effect may be mediated by a presynaptic mechanism; methionine sulfoximine profoundly inhibits brain glutamine synthetase, thereby interrupting the astrocyte-neuron glutamate shuttle and impairing neuronal glutamate release. Methionine sulfoximine also increases brain glycogen stores, and this increased energy reserve may benefit penumbral tissue during the peri-infarct period. Further study of the mechanisms by which methionine sulfoximine decreases infarct volume could lead to new therapeutic approaches for stroke.
