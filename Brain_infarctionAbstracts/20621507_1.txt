Lacunar infarction (LI) remains an important stroke subtype in Japan. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of outcome determinants in LI. This study was a single center observational study and included 163 consecutive patients (108 male, 55 female; mean age 69 years). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge were used to evaluate stroke severity. We determined the location of the infarct, the grade of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and the prevalence of silent brain infarcts, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and smoking. We compared 2 groups, good outcome (mRS score 0-2) and poor outcome (mRS score 3-5), using multiple logistic regression analysis. We found significant differences between the 2 groups according to female sex (P = .04), WMH (P = .04), and NIHSS score (P < .001). After multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-11.4; P = .03), and NIHSS score (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.7-3.3; P < .001) were independently associated with poor outcome. Elderly onset, poor outcome, and hypercholesterolemia were more common in female patients, whereas smoking was more prevalent in males. Our data indicate that sex differences exist in Japanese LI patients with regard to risk factors and outcome. The treatment of risk factors based on sex differences is important to the management of LI.
