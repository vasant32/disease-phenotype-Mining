We studied the effects of acute ethanol intoxication on platelet function, coagulation factors, and fibrinolytic activity in 12 healthy men. During the ethanol session, 10 of the 12 developed a transient decrease in fibrinolytic activity. Ethanol ingestion increased factor VIII coagulant activity. VIII-related antigen, and VIII-ristocetin cofactor. The highest levels were detected 16 hours after beginning ethanol ingestion (p less than 0.001), and the bleeding time decreased at 12 hours (p less than 0.01). Ethanol had no effects on platelet count, beta-thromboglobulin, antithrombin III, ethanol gelation, or fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. Decreased fibrinolytic activity, increased factor VIII complex, and shortened bleeding time may explain why ethanol intoxication increases susceptibility to cerebral thrombosis.
