There is evidence that object-location memory consists of three separate processes, that is, positional memory, binding of objects to locations, and a possible integration mechanism. A group of 26 patients with lesions following ischaemic stroke was studied to find evidence for selective impairments in these three processes using displays with pictures of everyday objects on different locations. Moreover, object-recognition memory and visuospatial construction was assessed. The Corsi Block-Tapping Task and Oxford Stylus Maze Test were included as standard spatial-memory tests. The results showed that of these 26 patients, 8 patients had selective impairments in the aforementioned object-location memory task conditions (both after immediate and delayed testing). These data further support the existence of separate cognitive processes within memory for object locations that can be selectively affected by cerebral dysfunction.
