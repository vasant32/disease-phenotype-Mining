A case of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies in a healing brain infarct is described. Morphologically this was consistent with cerebral malacoplakia. There are only 6 previously reported cases of cerebral malacoplakia, and only 1 of them was a consequence of postpartum stroke. The histologic and ultrastructural features of the malacoplakia lesion are reported and compared with the previously reported cases.
