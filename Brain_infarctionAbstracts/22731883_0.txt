An adult greyhound was evaluated on three occasions for acute, intracranial neurologic signs. Based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, there were T2-hyperintense and T1-hypointense, noncontrast enhancing lesions in the cerebellum, and brain stem. Using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), the lesions were characterized initially by restricted water diffusion. The presumptive diagnosis on each occasion was acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident leading to infarction. This allowed us to characterize the changes in appearance of infarcted neural tissue on the standard MR sequences over time, and to confirm that the DWI could be successfully used in low-field imaging.
