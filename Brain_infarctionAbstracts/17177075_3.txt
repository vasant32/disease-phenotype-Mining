The neuroprotective effects of intravenous rasagiline were investigated in a rat model of stroke. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was performed in male rats and the short- (neurological severity score [NSS], infarct size), intermediate- (cognition) and long-term (necrotic area) effects were assessed. A bolus (3 mg/kg) of rasagiline followed by a 3-h infusion (3 mg/kg/h), initiated immediately after MCA occlusion, reduced infarct size by 48.6% and NSS by 32.7% relative to saline treatment. Cognitive function, tested in a water maze 2-3 weeks after occlusion, also significantly improved compared with saline-treated controls. Necrotic brain area was 35-50% smaller with rasagiline than with saline following a single bolus dose. The single bolus rasagiline dose was as effective as a rasagiline bolus followed by rasagiline infusion in short-term outcomes. The neuroprotective effect of rasagiline was fully reproducible when administered at 2 h following occlusion but not after 4 h.
