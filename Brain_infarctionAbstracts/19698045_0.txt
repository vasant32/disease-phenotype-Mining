Intracranial atherosclerotic disease accounts for 5-10% of ischemic strokes in the US. Lesions located in the anterior cerebral artery territory are infrequently reported. Patients in whom medical therapy fails are at a high risk for recurrent ischemic events, in which case intracranial angioplasty or stenting may be a reasonable therapy. There is a paucity of literature describing angioplasty of fixed atherosclerotic lesions affecting the anterior cerebral artery territory, and especially the A(2) segment. This case illustrates that this vessel segment may be treated with balloon angioplasty.
