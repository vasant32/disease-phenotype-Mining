BACKGROUND: To evaluate differences in the temporal profile of acute phase response (APR) between ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied APR parameters (< 24 h and 3-5 day) in 88 consecutive patients (43 ICH and 45 IS). The increase/decrease of the parameters between both dates was analyzed. RESULTS: Leukocyte increase (LI) and fibrinogen increase (FI) is significantly higher in ICH than in IS (p = 0.047 and p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: APR temporal profile is different for ICH and IS.
