Anticardiolipin antibodies are a group of antiphospholipid autoantibodies seen primarily in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases. We report 3 patients, 2 without systemic lupus, who suffered ischemic brain infarction associated with these antibodies in the absence of detectable lupus anticoagulant activity. Anticardiolipin antibodies, possibly associated with a lupus anticoagulant-like thrombotic tendency, may be a newly recognized cause of ischemic stroke.
