One hundred and thirty-two patients, 86 men and 46 women, aged from 46 to 78 years, mean age 67 +/- 9 years, with ischemic stroke have been studied, the diagnosis confirmed using CT or section study. Pneumonia was developed in 15 (11%) of patients, its frequency was significantly higher in patients with hemorrhage stroke and brain infarction of the complex genesis as compared with other types of stroke (chi2 = 10.42, p < 0.05). Pneumonia was developed more often in patients with total infarction in the system of inner carotid artery than in patients with partial infarction in the carotid system (26.9 and 4.8%, respectively, p < 0.05) as well as in patients with consciousness and swallowing disorders in the acute period of disease. The correlation between the frequency of pneumonia and neurologic deficit has been studied. Higher mortality and disability rates were observed in the group of patients with pneumonia.
