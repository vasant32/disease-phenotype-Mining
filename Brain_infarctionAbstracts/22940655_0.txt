A 36-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for examination of a nodular shadow in the left lung. Chest 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) revealed a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF) of 21 mm in diameter composed of the feeding artery (A4) and the draining vein (V4) in the left S4. Abdominal enhanced CT revealed multiple hepatic arteriovenous fistula. Brain CT revealed a cavernous hemangioma in right occipital cerebrum. He had a family history, habitual epistaxis, and oral telangiectasia and was diagnosed as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia:HHT). According to his family history, PAVF was likely to be a risk factor of brain infarction and abscess, and the wedge resection of the lingual lobe was performed to remove PAVF.
