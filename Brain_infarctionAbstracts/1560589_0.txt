In recent years, the number of elderly patients who require operation has been increasing. We experienced three patients with perioperative brain infarction, occurring respectively, during the preoperative period, just after operation, and three days after operation. All three patients had more than one of the common risk factors for cerebrovascular accidents, including hypertension, advanced age, hyperfibrinogenemia, diabetes mellitus, and past history of cerebrovascular accident. On the basis of our experience with these three patients, we suggest the following: (1) Waiting period of elective surgery should be reconsidered in some cases with a past history of stroke. (2) Some high-risk patients may benefit from anticoagulative or antiaggregative drugs (e.g. low-molecular dextran or prostaglandin E1) to prevent brain ischemia. (3) Abrupt control of hypertension or diabetes mellitus status undoubtedly adversely affects the patient's general condition; and (4) A practical monitoring system to detect regional brain ischemia during operation under general anesthesia should be developed.
