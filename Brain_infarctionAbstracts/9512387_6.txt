To study the effects of glutamate transporters on the pathogenesis of brain infarct, pharmacological and histological analyses were carried out on the thrombotic focal ischemic model. Expression of mRNA coding for the glutamate transporter GLAST increased significantly in the penumbra at 72 h following the ischemia. Combined with confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis, double staining showed expression of GLAST mRNA in both neurons and glial cells in the penumbra. L-trans-Pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (L-trans-PDC), a glutamate uptake inhibitor, dose-dependently enhanced the volume of the infarct induced by the ischemia. The results suggest that a compensatory increase in the activity of glutamate transporter may accompany pathological changes after ischemic injury.
