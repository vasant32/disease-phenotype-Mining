BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The study aimed to investigate the predictive value of neurobiochemical markers of brain damage (protein S-100B and neuron-specific enolase [NSE]) with respect to early neurobehavioral outcome after stroke. METHODS: We investigated 58 patients with completed stroke who were admitted to the stroke unit of the Department of Neurology at Magdeburg University. Serial venous blood samples were taken after admission and during the first 4 days, and protein S-100B and NSE were analyzed by the use of immunoluminometric assays. In all patients, lesion topography and vascular supply were analyzed and volume of infarcted brain areas was calculated. The neurological status was evaluated by a standardized neurological examination and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission, at days 1 and 4 on the stroke unit, at day 10, and at discharge from the hospital. Comprehensive neuropsychological examinations were performed in all patients with first-ever stroke event and supratentorial brain infarctions. Functional outcome was measured with the Barthel score at discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: NSE and protein S-100B concentrations were significantly correlated with both volume of infarcted brain areas and NIHSS scores. Patients with an adverse neurological outcome had a significantly higher and significantly longer release of both markers. Neuropsychological impairment was associated with higher protein S-100B release, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations and kinetics of protein S-100B and NSE have a high predictive value for early neurobehavioral outcome after acute stroke. Protein S-100B concentrations at days 2 to 4 after acute stroke may provide valuable information for both neurological status and functional impairment at discharge from the acute care hospital.
