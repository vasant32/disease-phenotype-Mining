Tacrolimus (FK506), a potent immunosuppressive drug, is effective in attenuating brain infarction after cerebral ischemia. However, there has been no report characterizing the neuroprotective action and therapeutic time window of tacrolimus systematically using different types of stroke models and extended observation periods. Therefore, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of tacrolimus in three different animal models of cerebral ischemia: transient and permanent focal ischemia in rats and transient global ischemia in gerbils. Tacrolimus at doses higher than 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.) produced a statistically significant reduction in ischemic brain damage following permanent and transient focal ischemia in rats when administered immediately after the onset of ischemia. Tacrolimus (1 mg/kg, i.v.) demonstrated similar neuroprotective activity even after delayed administration (2 h after permanent or 1 h after transient focal ischemia). The neuroprotective effect of tacrolimus was still present 2 weeks after transient focal ischemia and 1 week after permanent focal ischemia. After transient global ischemia in gerbils, tacrolimus (1 mg/kg, i.v.) given immediately after reperfusion also produced long-lasting neuroprotective effects with a protective time-window of 1-2 h. Taken together, the results clearly indicate that tacrolimus exerts potent, long-term neuroprotective effects with a favorable therapeutic time-window, regardless of the model of cerebral ischemia. These results strengthen the notion that tacrolimus might be of clinical value for the treatment of acute stroke.
