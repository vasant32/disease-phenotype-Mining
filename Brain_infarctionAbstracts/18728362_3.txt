 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the rate of early neurological deterioration (END) and favorable outcomes after acute lacunar stroke following the use of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA). METHODS: A total of 76 acute lacunar stroke patients (<12 h from symptom onset) were enrolled during a 1-year period (n = 76). Comparisons were made between those who received (group A; n = 29) or did not receive (group B; n = 47) IV rtPA. RESULTS: END/favorable outcomes were observed in 24/31% of the subjects in group A and 21/23% in group B (p = 0.77/0.46). Subgroup analysis of the etiologic subtype of small-vessel occlusion showed that END/favorable outcomes were observed in about 33/33% and 15/19% of the patients in groups A and B, respectively (p = 0.21/0.34). CONCLUSIONS: The authors showed that the use of rtPA in cases of no lysible clots might not affect the END and favorable outcomes.
