Five elderly hypertensive patients presented with grand mal seizures and had computed tomographic (CT) findings consistent with lacunar infarction. Three of them had also a recent hemiparesis, contralateral to the side of the CT findings. Follow-up CT scans supported the diagnosis of lacunar infarction. Contrary to the accepted opinion, generalized epileptic seizures may be the presenting symptom of lacunar brain infarction.
