OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of lesions of insular cortex on cardiac damages in patients with cerebral infarction. METHODS: 24-hour dynamic electrocardiogram recordings was measured were performed in 74 patients with hemispheric cerebral infarction in the acute phase and in 39 control subjects. RESULTS: Supraventricular arrhythmias were significantly increased in groups of right insular infarction as compared with groups of lesions in other regions and with the control. A significantly increased rate of ST segment abnormality was found in groups of left insular infarction as compared with groups of lesions in other regions and with the controls. CONCLUSION: The effect of hemispheric cerebral infarction on heart function are mainly correlated with destruction of insular or regions adjacent to the insular. Increased rate of supraventricular arrhythmias is associated with right insular infarction. While increased rate of ST segment abnormality is associated with left insular infarction.
