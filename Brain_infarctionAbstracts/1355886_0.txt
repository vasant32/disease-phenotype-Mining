Strokes due to atherosclerosis are the most prominent neurological disease affecting adults, and efforts to reduce stroke occurrence, in addition to stroke-risk reduction, will require insights into molecular mechanisms. Our studies showing abnormal metabolism of low and high density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) in vivo and of RFLP in apoprotein AI, the major protein of HDL, in stroke-prone subjects suggest that greater exploration of fundamental mechanisms of atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI) should yield preventative strategies, the ultimate treatment for strokes.
