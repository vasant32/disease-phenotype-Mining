An arteriographic investigation has shown that segmental spasm occurs in a relatively high frequency of patients with total brain infarction (12 of 30), and if spasm at the origin of arterial branches is included, the frequency is still higher (19 of 30). The phenomenon is possibly a sign of changed sympathetic tone, the pathophysiological significance of which is discussed.
