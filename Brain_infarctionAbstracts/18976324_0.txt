 OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare the course of IS due to ptAF and pxAF. METHODS: A prospective, single-center study was conducted in patients with AF and acute IS with 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: We included 178 patients: 70 (39%) with pxAF and 108 (61%) with ptAF. Compared with patients with ptAF, patients with pxAF more often presented with subcortical, mainly lacunar strokes (21% vs 8%, P = 0.01) and were less frequently dependent at discharge (16% vs 42%, P < 0.001) and after 6 months (16% vs 20%, P < 0.001). Strokes in patients with pxAF were more frequently categorized as non-cardioembolic (35% vs 18%, P = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, after adjustment for confounding factors (diabetes, chronic heart failure, high risk of thromboembolism and lack of prestroke anticoagulation), ptAF was an important risk factor for unfavorable short-term (OR 5.4; P < 0.01) and long-term outcomes (OR 2.6, P = 0.01) of IS. In all patients with AF, the occurrence of non-cardioembolic stroke was related to a reduced risk of dependence or death in short-term outcome (OR 0.4, P = 0.04) and marginally influenced long-term outcome (OR 0.49, P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that, compared with patients with ptAF, ISs in patients with pxAF have better outcomes.
