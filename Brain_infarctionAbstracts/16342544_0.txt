The aim of this study was to identify obstacles for recruiting organ donors in the ICU. All specialists in neurosurgery and half of the specialists in anaesthesiology in Sweden were surveyed. Response rate was 67%. The following obstacles were identified: A neutral approach of the physicians when requesting organ donation of the families instead of a pro-donation approach; ethical problems concerning non-therapeutic ventilation and requesting donation of grieving families; varying competence in diagnosing brain infarction; lack of resources at the ICU. Suggestions for organizational and educational improvements are given.
