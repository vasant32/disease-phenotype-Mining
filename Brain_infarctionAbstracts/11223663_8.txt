Arginine vasopressin (AVP) may play a role in the development of ischemic brain edema and/or cerebral vasospasm. Data available on AVP plasma levels in ischemic stroke are few and discordant. In order to ascertain whether changes in AVP plasma levels occur in ischemic stroke, plasma AVP levels, plasma osmolality and mean arterial pressure were determined in 24 patients with unprecedented ischemic cerebral infarction and in 15 controls over a 24-hour period. In stroke patients, mean 24-hour plasma AVP levels (7.2 +/- 0.8 ng/l) were higher (p < 0.05) than in control subjects (2.4 +/- 0.3 ng/l), and correlated with the severity score of the neurologic deficit and the mean size of the lesion. In patients with a more severe neurologic deficit, the mean 24-hour plasma AVP levels (8.7 +/- 1.0 ng/l) were higher than in patients with a less severe neurologic deficit (5.2 +/- 0.8 ng/l). Data indicate that in ischemic stroke an increased AVP secretion occurs independently of osmotic or baroreceptorial mechanisms. The possibility that AVP may play a role in neuronal cell damage following cerebral ischemia warrants further attention.
