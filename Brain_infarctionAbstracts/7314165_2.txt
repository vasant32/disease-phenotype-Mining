A method for measuring regional cerebral circulation time (rCCT) between the hemispheres using intravenous pertechnetate and a multidetector system is presented. Interhemispheric differences of rCCT instead of absolute values were selected because of the variation of pertechnetate bolus dispersion due to changes in the systemic circulation and injection technique inter-and intraindividually. Time activity curves over one minute were analyzed by a modified gamma function fitting method. The results are printed as a brain map which shows reference values and abnormal findings. Abnormal rCCT asymmetry was observed in 10 out of 77 controls (13%) and 58 out of 65 patients with cerebral infarction (89%). Within 2 weeks after a stroke shorter circulation time values on the side of the lesion than on the contralateral side were found in 5 patients. In the severe infarction cases and in the acute stages of infarction circulatory changes could be found in a great number of areas. In patients with manifest diabetes abnormal circulatory findings occurred in larger regions and in a greater number of the patients than in those without that disease. Although the luxury perfusion and diaschisis phenomena, as well as the influence of cross-over of the count rates between the hemispheres, reduce circulatory time differences, use of the present pertechnetate method allows detection of subtle regional circulatory changes in patients with brain infarction.
