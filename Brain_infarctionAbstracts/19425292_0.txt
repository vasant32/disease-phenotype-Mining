A method of modeling of hemorrhage stroke suggested in the study includes the application of the autoblood on the surviving brain slices for 25-40 min followed by their washing. The parameters of evoked bioelectrical activity (focal potentials) of the slices are registered. The extent of nervous cells injury is established by comparing the focal potentials parameters in the control and during the blood application. The potential to cell recovery after the blood exposure is defined by comparing of these parameters in the control and after washing. The method permits to increase the model repeatability to 100% and reveals the cell and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of hemorrhage stroke.
