We studied the frequency of supratentorial brain infarction as the cause of late-onset epilepsy in 680 patients with a first seizure after the age of 20, registered on an epilepsy register: 65 (10%) had seizures following a symptomatic supratentorial brain infarct. Brain infarction as the presumed cause of epilepsy was related to age at first seizure. A first seizure occurred within one year after brain infarction in 62%, and later than two years in 19%. Eight of 14 patients (57%) with an early seizure (< or = 2 weeks), and 28 of 41 patients (68%) with a first seizure later than two weeks post-stroke had seizure recurrences despite anti-epileptic treatment. Of 38 patients who underwent computed tomography head scan (CT), 32 (84%) had a cortical infarct, whereas six (16%) had one or more lacunar infarcts. This may indicate that lacunar infarction may be associated with post-stroke epilepsy. Using a detailed topographic brain atlas to localize the cortical infarcts, no 'specific epileptogenic' gyri could be identified. What factors predict future epilepsy in stroke patients need to be studied in prospective series of well-defined stroke subgroups.
