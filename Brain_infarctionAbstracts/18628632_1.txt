 AIMS: To find neurological or neuroimaging signs to predict neurological deterioration in acute lacunar infarctions. METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients with a supratentorial lacunar infarct, who were admitted within 48 h, were studied retrospectively. Progressive-type stroke (PS) was defined as progressive motor deficits that arose within 7 days after onset, by using the motor ratings of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (26%) were classified into the PS group. In the PS group, fluctuating or progressing onset (81 vs. 42%, p = 0.009), leg-predominant motor deficits on admission (63 vs. 16%, p = 0.001) and corona radiata lesion on diffusion-weighted MRI (100 vs. 69%, p = 0.013) were all more frequent than in the non-PS group. CONCLUSION: Bedside neurological assessment and MRI findings may allow us to predict PS and start early intensive treatment for preventing further neurological deterioration.
