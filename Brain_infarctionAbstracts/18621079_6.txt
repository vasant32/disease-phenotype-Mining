Intracerebral injection of the vasoconstrictor peptide, endothelin-1 (ET-1), has been used as a method to induce focal ischemia in rats. The relative technical simplicity of this model makes it attractive for use in mice. However, the effect of ET-1 on mouse brains has not been firmly established. In this study, we determined the ability of ET-1 to induce focal cerebral ischemia in four different mouse strains (CD1, C57/BL6, NOD/SCID, and FVB). In contrast to rats, intracerebral injection of ET-1 did not produce a lesion in any mouse strain tested. A combination of ET-1 injection with either CCA occlusion or N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) injection produced only a small infarct and its size was strain-dependent. A triple combination of CCA occlusion with co-injection of ET-1 and l-NAME produced a lesion in all mouse strains tested, and this resulted in a significant motor deficit. However, lesion size was still relatively small and strain-dependent. This study shows that ET-1 has a much less potent effect for producing an infarct in mice than rats.
