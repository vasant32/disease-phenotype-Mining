 OBJECTIVE: Platelet Orai1 channels mediate store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE), which is required for procoagulant activity and arterial thrombus formation. Pharmacological blockage of these channels may provide a novel way of antithrombotic therapy. Therefore, the thromboprotective effect of SOCE blockers directed against platelet Orai1 is determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Candidate inhibitors were screened for their effects on SOCE in washed human platelets. Tested antagonists included the known compounds, SKF96365, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate, and MRS1845 and the novel compounds, Synta66 and GSK-7975A. The potency of SOCE inhibition was in the order of Synta66>2-aminoethyl diphenylborate>GSK-7975A>SKF96365>MRS1845. The specificity of the first 3 compounds was verified with platelets from Orai1-deficient mice. Inhibitory activity on procoagulant activity and high-shear thrombus formation was assessed in plasma and whole blood. In the presence of plasma, all 3 compounds suppressed platelet responses and restrained thrombus formation under flow. Using a murine stroke model, arterial thrombus formation was provoked in vivo by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Postoperative administration of 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate markedly diminished brain infarct size. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma-soluble SOCE blockers such as 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate suppress platelet-dependent coagulation and thrombus formation. The platelet Orai1 channel is a novel target for preventing thrombotic events causing brain infarction.
