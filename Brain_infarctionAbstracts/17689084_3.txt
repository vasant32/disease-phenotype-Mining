While gene polymorphism for angiotensinogen (AGT) is reported to contribute to the regulation of blood pressure and salt sensitivity, its effect on the risk of ischemic stroke remains controversial. We hypothesized that polymorphism of the AGT gene could be a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Major clinical risk factors and the AGT gene M235T polymorphism were examined in 147 consecutive stroke patients and 133 healthy age-matched controls. All patients were categorized into four stroke types (single lacuna, multiple lacunae, large-artery atherosclerosis and branch atheromatous disease in brainstem) and two vascular groups (large and perforating arterial lesions). The AGT gene M allele significantly increased the risk of single lacuna, multiple lacunae and small arterial lesions, in male patients (p=0.029, 0.031 and 0.026, respectively). Synergistic effects of the AGT gene polymorphism and clinical risks were not observed. In conclusion, AGT M allele may present a risk of lacunar infarctions in Japanese men, independent of hypertension.
