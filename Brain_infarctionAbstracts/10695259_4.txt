A cross-sectional observation was performed to assess the relationship between the coagulation-fibrinolysis system and the subclinical indicators of arteriosclerosis in a healthy male population. Subjects were 445 workers (18.9-49.4, Av. 36.2 yrs) in viscose rayon manufacturing factories in Japan. Coagulation-fibrinolysis parameters determined were D-dimer(DD), thrombin antithrombin III complex (TAT), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1). The following indicators of arteriosclerosis were examined; systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), stiffness parameter of the carotid artery using ultrasound (beta), pulse wave velocity of the aorta (PWV), and a number of lacunar infarctions from brain MRI. After age-stratification(-29, 30-39, 40+ yrs), the subjects were classified into quartiles by coagulation-fibrinolysis parameters. The mean values of SBP and DBP and beta and PWV, the prevalence of brain infarctions were compared across these quartiles by means of analysis of variance, chi-square test, respectively. Multivariate analysis was also employed to adjust other risk factors. In conclusion, SBP and DBP and beta, PWV were elevated by increase of PAI1, TAT, respectively, in the 40+ years group even after adjustment for other possible risk factors. DD had no relation to any of the indicators of arteriosclerosis. None of the coagulation-fibrinolysis parameters had any relation to brain infarctions.
