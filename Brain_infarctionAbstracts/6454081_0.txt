Various therapeutic methods have been attempted for cerebral infarction, but the development of more effective methods is still awaited. We have investigations of the effect of mannitol in preventing the development of cerebral infarction and have reported it effects in clinical cases of operated cerebral aneurysms. In recent years, our attention has been drawn to the so-called red cell substitute, perfluorochemicals (FC), which has a high oxygen-carrying capacity and a small particle less than 0.1 mu. In the present studies, using infarction models in dogs which have previously developed and reported, observations are made on recovery of brain electrical activity in severe ischemia, suppressing brain swelling following recirculation of cerebral blood flow and protection upon the hemorrhagic brain infarction, due to administration of mannitol or FC. These experimental results indicate that the combined administration of mannitol and FC is effective in protecting the brain from cerebral ischemia.
