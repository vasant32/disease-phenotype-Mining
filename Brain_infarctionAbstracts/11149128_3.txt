We report on a 4-year-old girl with hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome (HHS), a rare entity in childhood. The girl was referred to us from a local hospital with a history of recurrent fever, vomiting, and seizures. On admission she was markedly dehydrated. Initial investigations revealed severe hyponatremia (serum Na 120 mmol/l), hypochloremia (serum Cl 68 mmol/l), and mild hypokalemia (serum K 3.3 mmol/l), while serum calcium and magnesium were normal. Serum urea was 5 mmol/l and serum creatinine was 62 mumol/l. Despite hyponatremic dehydration, her urine output was high (2050 ml/24 h), as was her urinary sodium (168 mmol/24 h). She had massive transient proteinuria (maximal 1642 mg/24 h) while being severely hypertensive (blood pressure 210/160 mmHg). Further investigations revealed right kidney scarring, hyper-reflexive bladder dysfunction, massive brain infarcts, and myocardial left ventricular hypertrophy. Renal arteries were normal on arteriography. Blood pressure control resulted in normalization of serum and urinary electrolytes and decrease of proteinuria. Hyponatremia and transient massive proteinuria in this patient seem to be caused by high-pressure-forced diuresis due to malignant renoparenchymal hypertension.
