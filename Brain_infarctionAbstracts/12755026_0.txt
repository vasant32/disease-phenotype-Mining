A contralateral extra-axial hematoma sometimes occurs during an operation on an acute subdural hematoma and may become fatal. Using a combined procedure of burr hole evacuation and craniotomy, we treated 2 cases of multiple traumatic acute subdural hematomas. Our policy for such cases is first to perform a burr hole evacuation for the acute subdural hematoma in the emergency room, while simultaneously preparing the operation room for a possible further operation. Next, we perform computed tomography (CT) of the brain. If the evacuation does not provide enough decompression, we either carry out a craniotomy at the same site, or, we observe the patient without resorting to craniotomy. However, if the patient's condition deteriorates, burr hole evacuation is repeated and/or craniotomy is carried out as soon as possible on the lesion at the already prepared operation room. Both of our patients received craniotomy for another subdural hematoma after the burr hole evacuation. Though his intracranial pressure was well managed during the acute stage, one of the patients died 21 days after the trauma due to an extensive brain infarction caused by vasospasm. The other regained consciousness and was able to walk 5 months after the trauma in spite of cerebral infarction from vasospasm. The possible mechanism of vasospasm in severe head injury is also discussed.
