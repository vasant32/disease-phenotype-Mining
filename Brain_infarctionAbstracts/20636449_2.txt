 OBJECTIVES: To analyze the initial clinical and radiological findings, the surgical treatment, and the clinical outcome following surgical decompression in patients with space-occupying bilateral cerebellar infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with expansive bilateral cerebellar infarction and decreased level of consciousness were operated with suboccipital craniectomy, removal of the infarcted tissue, and placement of external ventricular drainage. Long-term outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS). RESULTS: Mean Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score before surgery was 8.9 ± 3.3 and improved to 12.6 ± 3.6 at discharge. At the long-term follow-up (median 57.6 months), six patients had a favorable outcome (mRS 1.3 ± 0.8). Four patients, all with an associated brain stem infarct, had a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of brain stem infarcts, surgical treatment resulted in a favorable clinical outcome and should be considered a treatment option for patients with expansive bilateral cerebellar infarction.
