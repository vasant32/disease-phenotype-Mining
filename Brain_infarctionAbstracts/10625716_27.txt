BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis commonly exists as one manifestation of more generalized atherosclerosis. It is a progressive but potentially curable disorder. Thus, information on renal artery involvement in atherosclerotic diseases could be important. We investigated the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in autopsied patients with stroke over 40 years of age. METHODS: From 2167 consecutive autopsy patients who died between 1980 and 1997, we studied 346 cases of mean age of 69+/-11 years with clinical evidence of stroke. RESULTS: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (>/=75% luminal area narrowing) was found in 36 patients (10.4%). Patients with renal artery stenosis were older and had worse renal function. Renal artery stenosis was found in 14.7%, 28.6%, and 23.9% of patients with hypertension, renal insufficiency, and aortic aneurysm, respectively. Extracranial carotid artery stenosis (>50% luminal area narrowing) was found in 101 patients (29.2%). Of the 346 stroke patients, 256 had a history of brain infarction. In patients with brain infarction, renal artery stenosis was found in 31 (12.1%) and carotid stenosis was found in 81 (33.6%). Patients with carotid artery stenosis were more likely to have renal artery stenosis than patients without carotid artery stenosis (24.4% versus 5.9%, P<0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified renal insufficiency, hypertension, female gender, and presence of carotid artery stenosis as independent predictors of renal artery stenosis in patients with brain infarction. CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal that atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is common in patients with stroke, especially in those with brain infarction.
