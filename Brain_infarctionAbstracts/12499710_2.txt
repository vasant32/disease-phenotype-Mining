Some reports indicate that exposure to iodinated contrast medium (CM) could worsen the outcome of patients with brain infarction. In this prospective study, we compared the outcome of 77 patients receiving and 128 not receiving nonionic iodinated CM. Stroke severity was assessed by the Scandinavian Prognostic Stroke Score, and outcome by the Rankin Scale. All radiological studies using intravenous or intra-arterial CM were registered. Two nonionic iodinated CM (iopamidol and iohexol) were used. Exposure to CM did not influence case fatality, ability to live at home, ability to walk, disability and stroke severity. Initial stroke severity and arterial hypertension were independent determinants of poor neurological recovery or death. Large infarct, age, male gender, and baseline stroke severity were independent determinants of major disability or death. CM enhancement on CT did not show any harmful effect on stroke severity or outcome. As a conclusion, intravascular administration of nonionic iodinated CM did not influence stroke severity or outcome of our patients.
