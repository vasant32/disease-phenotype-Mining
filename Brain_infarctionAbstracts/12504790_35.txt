Bone marrow stem cells are able to differentiate into nervous and endothelial cells. In our study, we found that administration of a bone marrow-stimulating factor (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF 50 microg/kg) decrease the brain infarct volume and enhance survival rate in a model of cerebral ischemia. Taken together, these data suggest a beneficial effect of a pharmacological endogenous bone marrow mobilization in the course of cerebral ischemia and open a new direction for cellular therapy strategy in stroke.
