OBJECTIVE: To identify the diagnostic effect of spiral CT in brain vascular diseases. METHODS: Sixty four patients underwent CT angiography, including 22 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 6 patients with oculomotor nerve paralysis, 5 patients with brain substance hemorrhage, 6 patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), 4 patients with mass or aneurysm, 5 patients with brain infarction, 16 patients with epilepsy or headache and dizzy. 8 cases also underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA), 4 cases were performed operation in 64 cases. RESULTS: Spiral computed tomography angiography (SCTA) was all succeeded in 64 cases. 26 aneurysms and 8 AVMs were found by SCTA; in 6 of 8 cases of AVMs, their supply arteries and drainage veins were clearly displayed; SCTAs of 5 cases with substance hemorrhage were normal; in 1 of 5 cases with cerebral hemisphere infarction, its internal carotid obstruction was demonstrated by SCTA; the results of 12 SCTAs were identical with the results of their DSA or operation. CONCLUSION: SCTA is a useful non-invasive inspection method for detecting brain vascular diseases such as aneurysms and AVMs.
