The clinical development, changes of the rheological blood properties and lipid metabolism were analysed in 70 patients with acute and subacute hemorrhagical infarctions into the hemispheres. Two clinical types in the development of hemorrhagical brain infarctions are described. The rheological blood properties and lipid metabolism had certain differences in comparison to patients with hemispheric hemorrhagical and ischemic strokes. They were also changed depending upon the age and duration of the illness. The pathogenesis of the changes detected is substantiated and their significance for microhemocirculation in patients with hemorrhagical brain infarctions is discussed.
