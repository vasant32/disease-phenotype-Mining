BACKGROUND: Specific stroke subtypes like subarachnoid hemorrhages or malignant brain infarcts require immediate interventions, but treatment options are offered mainly in specialized centers. For this reason, interhospital transfers from primary hospitals need to be done without delay. METHODS: The telemedic pilot project for integrative stroke care (TEMPiS) connects 2 stroke centers and 12 regional hospitals in Bavaria (Germany). Core elements are the implementation of stroke wards, telemedic consultation and improvement of emergency interhospital transfers. Organization of patient transports is offered by the central telemedic service. During the first 12 months of the continuing project all interhospital transfers initiated by the central telemedic service were prospectively documented. Emergency transports were analysed according to diagnosis, type of transport, distance and time delays. RESULTS: A total of 252 interhospital transfers were recommended in teleconsultations; finally 221 transports took place. Median total duration of transfers (including the necessary arrangements) was 134 min (interquartile range: 105-219) for intracerebral hemorrhages (N = 58), 138 min (95-157) for subarachnoid hemorrhages (N = 31), 161 min (100-230) for malignant infarcts (N = 22) and 147 min (109-180) for suspected basilar artery occlusion (N = 28). Time from admission in the primary hospital to initiation of interhospital transfer was 135 min (median; interquartile range: 86-172), transport time was 81 min (60-116). Helicopter transport did not save time for transfer distances up to 50 kilometres, compared to transport via ambulance (including assistance of hospital physicians). Transport using a special intensive care vehicle was much more time consuming because of the longer transport preparation time. CONCLUSION: Emergency transfers of stroke patients are time consuming. This may contribute to additional harm being done to severely ill patients. Faster organization and conduct of transports is required.
