Over the past 10 years, 10 cats with primary central nervous system infection by larvae of Cuterebra flies have been documented at Cornell University. Clinical abnormalities noted in all cats were progressive and most commonly consisted of depression (6/10), blindness (6/10), and behavior changes (2/10). Affected cats presented most commonly in July (2/10) and August (7/10); one cat was presented in September. The diverse histopathologic changes are unique to this aberrant migration and consist of a combination of five characteristic features: 1) parasitic track lesion (7/10), 2) superficial laminar cerebrocortical necrosis (10/10), 3) cerebral infarction (8/10), 4) subependymal rarefaction and astrogliosis with or without ependymal cell loss (7/10), and 5) subpial astrogliosis (7/10). Changes 2-5 occurred throughout the parenchyma unassociated with the track lesion or the parasite in the affected tissue. The larvae have been recovered most commonly in the region of the olfactory bulbs and peduncles, optic nerves, and cribriform plate, suggesting entry from the nasal cavity. Many of the changes noted are suggestive of a toxic factor elaborated by the parasite and borne within the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as vascular compromise as a component in those cats with brain infarction. Because of the prevalence of infarction associated with this syndrome and the lack of reported cases of such lesions in regions of the world devoid of the fly, we propose that aberrant cuterebral larval migration in the brain is the cause of feline ischemic encephalopathy.
