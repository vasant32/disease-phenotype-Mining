A 35-year-old man was hospitalized for the treatment of severe asthma attack. His condition improved with intensive steroid chemotherapy under artificial ventilation. On the 12th hospital day, he was taken off respirator support but lost consciousness afterward. Computed tomography of the brain disclosed multiple hypodense lesions with bleeding. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging disclosed low-intensity lesions containing high-intensity areas. T2-weighted images showed heterogeneous high-intensity lesions. The autopsy specimen demonstrated multiple brain abscesses. Histologic examination revealed branching fungal hyphae in abscess walls and also extending through arterial walls with emboli. These findings yielded a diagnosis of multiple Aspergillus infarct abscesses of the brain.
