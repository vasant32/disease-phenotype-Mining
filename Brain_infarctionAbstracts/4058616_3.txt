There are conflicting reports of an increase in the activity of creatine kinase BB isoenzyme (CK-BB) in the serum of patients with cerebrovascular disease. The serum CK-BB activity of 33 patients with ischemic brain infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracerebral hemorrhage was measured with a bioluminescence method (CK-B Kit, LKB-Wallac) in combination with immunoprecipitation. The results were compared with lesions determined by computed tomography. In the control group (N = 19) there was a mean activity of 0.35 +/- 0.26 U/l (means +/- SE). In patients with small lesions (N = 11) the activity was 0.41 +/- 0.21 U/l, which was not significantly elevated when compared to the control group (Mann/Whitney U test). Therefore, patients with more extensive lesions (N = 12) and the group with severe lesions (N = 10) showed a significant elevation, with a mean activity of 0.61 +/- 0.34 U/l and 1.12 +/- 0.52 U/l, respectively. The group with severe lesions had a maximum activity on the first day after the initial symptoms.
