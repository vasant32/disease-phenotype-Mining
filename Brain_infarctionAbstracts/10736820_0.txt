Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD) is a clinicopathologic entity established by Frizzera in 1974. Reported cases of AILD with pleuropulmonary involvement have been increasing recently. At Nogata Central Hospital, an 82-year-old male inpatient with brain infarctions and chronic bronchitis showed a rapid growth of systemic lymphadenopathy and various other symptoms. We diagnosed the case as AILD by histopathologic examination of a lymph node. Chest radiography and computed tomography demonstrated a loss of volume of the right lung caused by intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and a pleural effusion. Although cases of AILD with pleuropulmonary involvement have been increasing, no cases with almost total atelectasis of a lung have been reported as yet. AILD should be taken into account as a disease which may cause atelectasis of a lung.
