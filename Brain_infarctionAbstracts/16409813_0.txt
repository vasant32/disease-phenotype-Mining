 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical manifestations, operative applications, complications and outcomes of peritrochanteric fracture of femur in patients 75-years old and over. METHODS: The clinical data of 261 patients, aged 79.5 (75-96), of peritrochanteric fracture (265 hips) were analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of different accompanied medical diseases was 2.6/person on average. The internal fixation methods included DHS, DHS plus trochanteric steady plate or intramedullary interlocking nails, such as Gamma nail, PFN and reconstructive nails. The mean operation time was 73 minutes. 224 cases were followed-up over 6 months after operation 81% of which got excellent or good results. The complications included acute heart failure, brain infarction, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities, lung infection, and stress ulceration, bed sore, and acute respiratory failure. Thirteen cases died of cardiopulmonary insufficiency, cardiac infarction, brain thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: Complications are frequent in aged patients. Appropriate operative methods help reduce complications and mortality rates.
