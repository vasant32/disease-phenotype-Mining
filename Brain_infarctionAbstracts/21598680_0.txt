We hypothesize that early ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can afford protection against focal brief and prolonged cerebral ischemia with subsequent reperfusion as well as permanent brain ischemia in rats by amelioration of regional cerebral blood flow. Adult male Wistar rats (n=97) were subjected to transient (30 and 60 minutes) and permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. IPC protocol consisted of two episodes of 5-min common carotid artery occlusion + 5-min reperfusion prior to test ischemia either followed by 48 hours of reperfusion or not. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride and Evans blue were used for delineation of infarct size and anatomical area at risk (comprises ischemic penumbra and ischemic core), respectively. Blood flow in the MCA vascular bed was measured with use of Doppler ultrasound. The IPC resulted in significant infarct size limitation in both transient and permanent MCA occlusion. Importantly, IPC caused significant reduction of area at risk after 30 min of focal ischemia as compared to controls [med(min-max) 11.4% (3.59-2 0.35%) vs. 2.47% (0.8-9.31%), p = 0.018] but it failed to influence area at risk after 5 min of ischemia [med(min-max) 7.61% (6.32-10.87%) vs. 8.2% (4.87-9.65%), p > 0.05]. No differences in blood flow were found between IPC and control groups using Doppler ultrasound. This is suggestive of the fact that IPC does not really influence blood flow in the large cerebral arteries such as MCA but it might have some effect on smaller arteries. It seems that, along with well established cytoprotective effects of IPC, IPC-mediated reduction of area at risk by means of improvement in local cerebral blood flow may contribute to infarct size limitation after focal transient and permanent brain ischemia in rats.
