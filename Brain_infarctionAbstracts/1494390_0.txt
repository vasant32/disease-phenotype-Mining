Radiological differentiation between hemorrhagic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage is important for patient management. To ascertain CT features of hemorrhagic infarction, we studied the findings in 19 cases with autopsy-proven hemorrhagic infarction. Most cases had multiple, mainly cortically located, small hyperdensities. However, some presented with a single hyperdensity, deeply located, that could be mistaken for primary intracerebral hematoma. Hemorrhagic infarctions usually present as multiple, small hyperdensities within a hypodense area compatible with an arterial territory. The shape can be round, slitlike, curvilinear, or spotted. Most often the hyperdensities are located cortically; however, some larger, deeply located hyperdensities may falsely suggest primary intracerebral hematoma. Some guidelines for a more reliable radiological separation between hemorrhagic infarctions and intracerebral hematomas are suggested.
