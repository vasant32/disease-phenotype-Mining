The involvement of the left thalamus in language function has been largely demonstrated through the effects of thalamic lesion and/or stimulation upon language. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying thalamic aphasias remain a matter of debate. We report here on changes in the pattern of brain activity in auditory word processing, verb generation and visual lexical decision in a patient who sustained left thalamic infarct following the surgery of intractable mesio-temporal epilepsy with left hippocampal sclerosis. To some extent, our findings exemplify the way the left thalamus brings on line the cortical networks involved in language processing, suggested in the term 'selective engagement'.
