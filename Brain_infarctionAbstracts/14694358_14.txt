The TNFRSF1A gene was screened for polymorphisms in 95 subjects with premature myocardial infarction (MI), who also had one parent who had an MI. A total of 10 polymorphisms were found: three in the promoter region, two in exons and five in introns. All polymorphisms were genotyped in ECTIM, a case-control study of MI (1815 subjects). The nonsynonymous 92Q allele was found in 1.8, 1.0 and 1.7% of controls from Strasbourg, Belfast and Glasgow - respectively; in cases: 4.2, 2.2 and 3.2%. The population-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for MI associated with allele Q carrying was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.09-4.23). To check its possible implication in atherosclerosis, this polymorphism was then genotyped in the AXA Study (ultrasound examinations of carotid and femoral arteries in the context of an employment medical examination, 733 subjects), the EVA Study (ultrasound examinations of carotid arteries in a study of cognitive and vascular ageing, 1092 subjects) and the GENIC Study (on brain infarction (BI), 912 subjects). In the AXA Study, among smokers, carrying the 92Q allele was positively associated with the presence of a carotid plaque (OR 5.07; 95% CI: 1.64-15.63) and with a thickening of the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) (0.59 (0.11) vs 0.54 (0.11), P=0.045). In the EVA Study, carriers of allele 92Q had an increased mean carotid IMT (0.70 (0.09) vs 0.67 (0.13), P=0.02). No significant association of the 92Q allele was found with BI in the GENIC Study. Overall, these results may suggest that carriers of the 92Q allele may be at increased risk of atherosclerosis.
