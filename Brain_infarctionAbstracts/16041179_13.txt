The effect of edaravone as an inhibitor of ischemic brain damage in addition to routine treatment was retrospectively examined in 70 patients with lacunar infarction who were admitted within 24 hours of symptom onset. Clinical status was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The modified Rankin Scale (MRS) was used to assess clinical outcomes at 3 months after onset, with a good outcome defined as MRS score < or =2. Risk factors were also evaluated, including evidence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease, and a history of smoking longer than 2 months. The probability of a good outcome and independence at 3 months was assessed by backward stepwise logistic regression analysis based on the maximum likelihood ratio. Administration of edaravone yielded an odds ratio with multivariate adjustment of 6.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.35 to 50.32; p < 0.05) for a good outcome at 3 months. Higher baseline NIHSS score and higher age also adversely affected the outcome at 3 months (p < 0.005). Administration of edaravone improves the outcome of patients with lacunar infarction.
