A 25-year-old drug abuser who developed an unusual pattern of cerebral ischemic lesions is presented. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral borderzone infarctions which were attributed to a heroin-associated vasculitis of the basal cerebral arteries. Under probatory corticosteroid medication the mild neurological deficits completely disappeared.
