A significant association between Bam HI RFLP p53 gene polymorphism and brain infarction volume in patients with atherothrombotic ischemic stroke (AIS) from Moscow population was found. Biallelic Bam HI polymorphism in exon 5 of p53 gene was studied in 96 AIS patients, 100 their healthy siblings, 41 patients with chronic ischemic disease and 42 their healthy siblings. Magnetic resonance tomography with morphometric program "Osiris" (the Hospital of the University, Geneva) for infarction volume measuring was used on day 1 and 7 after stroke onset. The patients with (-/-) p53 Bam HI genotype had the smaller brain infarction sizes (< 40 cm3), comparing to those with (-/+) (chi 2 = 19.7; p < 0.001) and (+/+) (chi 2 = 12.3; p < 0.001) genotypes. According to Bayes statistics, development of smaller infarction size in AIS may be predicted with over than 65% probability in the patients with (-/-) p53 Bam HI genotype. A significant association between p53 Bam HI polymorphism and infarction volume in patients with carotid atherothrombotic stroke confirms an important role of apoptosis in ischemic brain lesions formation that demands temporary antiapoptotic influence on patients with stroke.
