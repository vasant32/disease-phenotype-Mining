The authors report a 72-year-old patient who presented with parkinsonism after hypoxic-ischemic insult. T1-weighted MRI revealed high signal intensity lesions in the basal ganglia. Pathologic study of the brain disclosed multiple foci of old infarcts with gliosis and lipid-laden and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, indicating a previous minor hemorrhage after infarction. This observation provided pathologic correlation with the patient's clinical symptoms and MRI.
