 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of dimerized basic fibroblast growth factor (dFGF), a novel engineered growth factor, in a model of functional recovery following focal cerebral infarction (stroke) in rats. METHODS: A focal stroke was made in mature male rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). dFGF was administered by intracisternal injection at one and three days after stroke. Tests to evaluate sensorimotor recovery of the contralateral limbs were done during the next three weeks after stroke. RESULTS: dFGF significantly enhanced recovery of sensorimotor function in limb placing and body swing tests compared to vehicle treatment. There were no differences in body weight or infarct volume in dFGF- vs. vehicle-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: dFGF represents a potential treatment to enhance functional recovery after stroke and offers several advantages over bFGF, including stability and independence from extracellular heparan sulfates.
