 INTRODUCTION: Results of earlier population and clinical studies confirmed relationship between stroke and obstructive sleep apnea. Our previous study on epidemiology of sleep-disordered breathing in Warsaw based on 676 subjects, mean age 56.6 +/- 8.2 years, confirmed OSA in 76 subjects (11.3%) mean apnea hypopnea index (AHI) - 25.3 +/- 16.1 revealed low incidence of stroke in OSA group (2 pts; 2.6%) and in subjects without OSA (20 pts; 3.4%). The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of stroke in newly diagnosed OSA subjects qualified to CPAP therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 342 consecutive pts (263 males and 79 females)--mean age--55.4 +/- 10.1 years with severe disease--AHI 39.7 +/- 22.5 and obesity--body mass index 35 +/- 6.6. History of stroke was confirmed in 16 pts before continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) introduction (4.7%) - group 1. Group 2 (without history of stroke) comprised of 326 pts (95.3%). RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant correlation between stroke and time spent in desaturation below 90% during polysomnography-- T90 (beta = -0.22, p = 0.009), diabetes (b = 0.16, p = 0.006), Epworth sleepiness score (beta = 0.14, p = 0.02) and coronary artery disease (b = 0.14, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke in OSA pts before CPAP treatment was related to overnight and daytime oxygenation, diabetes, daytime sleepiness and coronary artery disease. Incidence of stroke in our group was low (4.7%) and similar to previous data from population study.
