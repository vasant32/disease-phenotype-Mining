Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) showed brain-protective activity within the first 15 min after cerebral ischemia in rats. To understand its molecular mechanism, TPA derivates were intracerebroventricularly administered at 15 min before, and 15, 90, 120 min after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The reduction in mortality and cerebral infarction at 24 h was seen only with TPA administered at 15 min after MCAO. The down-regulation of endogenous TPA by the intracerebroventricular injection of TPA was found to be responsible for the protective effect on the integrity of blood-brain barrier after MCAO, as well as for the reduction in mortality and cerebral infarction. Moreover, for the first time we have found that the Kringle-2 domain is essential for the brain-protective activity of TPA.
