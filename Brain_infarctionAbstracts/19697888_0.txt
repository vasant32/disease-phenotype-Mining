We report a case of brain infarction in the anterior choroidal artery territory accompanied homonymous scotomas. A 59-year-old man with diabetes mellitus felt weakness in his left upper and lower extremities. He was admitted to our hospital with mild hemiparesis on his left side. He noticed a small black spot in the left inferior portion of his visual field; however, this disappeared within one minute. He had no visual defects as assessed by a confrontation test, but a Goldmann visual field test revealed that there were homonymous scotomas in the left inferior portion of the visual field. Brain MRI showed hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighted images in the territory of the right anterior choroidal artery. He was diagnosed as having a brain infarction. The anterior choroidal artery penetrates the lateral geniculate nucleus from the front, and branches of the artery usually supply the medial and lateral parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Occlusion of these branches causes the loss of the upper and lower homonymous sectors in the visual field. The present case exhibited homonymous scotomas. We assumed that our patient's homonymous scotomas were a variant form of wedge-shaped visual field deficits often seen in anterior choroidal artery syndrome. On the basis the experience gained in this case, we consider that patients with brain infarction in the anterior choroidal artery territory should undergo ophthalmological examination, even when no visual defects are detected by a confrontation test.
