The quantitative EEG (QEEG), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and circulation time of 17 patients were examined semisimultaneously thrice during the first 3 months after a cerebral supratentorial infarction. The EEG was quantified according to normalized slope descriptor technique in nine patients and by means of a combined period and amplitude analysis in eight patients. Intravenously injected isotopes 133Xenon and 99TcmO4 were used for blood flow and circulation time measurements. The QEEG-values improved during the whole follow-up period. Cerebral blood flow stayed low for all 3 months and did not alter during this period, while initially prolonged circulation time to some extent improved within 2 weeks remaining, however, prolonged even thereafter. A tendency for a positive correlation between QEEG and rCBF values in the infarcted hemisphere could be seen.
