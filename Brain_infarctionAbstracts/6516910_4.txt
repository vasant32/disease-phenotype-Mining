In four hypertensive patients, acute lowering of blood pressure by therapeutic or diagnostic procedures caused visual disturbances ranging from transient visual hallucinations to severe, long-lasting visual impairment. These symptoms were associated with occipital lobe cerebral infarcts that tended to occur in the border zones between the major cerebral arteries. The infarcts may be seen as the combined result of a "watershed" effect during acute hypotension and the presence of structural hypertensive vascular adaptation. When a hypertensive patient complains of visual disturbances during acute blood pressure lowering, the pressure should be allowed to settle at a level somewhat above normal.
