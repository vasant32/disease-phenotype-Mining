The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility of reporting brain CT examinations on liquid crystal display (LCD) flat-screen monitors vs state-of-the-art cathode-ray-tube (CRT) monitors. Ninety-five brain CT examinations of 95 patients were displayed on Picture archiving and communications system (PACS) workstations equipped either with a dedicated medical imaging LCD colour monitor or on a high-resolution CRT which is used for routine reporting of CT, MRI and digital radiography images in our institution. Fifty cases were negative and 45 cases were positive for early brain infarction (EBI), the latter being defined by a combination of one or more signs: dense artery; hypodensity of brain parenchyma; and local brain swelling verified by control scans. Ten radiologists had to rate presence or absence of EBI on a five-point scale. Ratings were evaluated by CORROC2 ROC software and areas under the ROC curve (A(z)) were computed. Significance of differences between the two viewing conditions were evaluated with Wilcoxon test. Mean A(z) of the ten observers was 0.7901 with LCD vs 0.7695 with CRT which did not show statistical significance (p=0.2030). In the setting investigated, reporting of CT studies from high-performance LCD monitors seems feasible without significant detriment to diagnostic performance.
