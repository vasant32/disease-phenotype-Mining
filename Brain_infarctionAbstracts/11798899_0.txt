OBJECTIVE: To study the types of HLA-DQA1 alleles in patients with essential hypertension (EH), athrothrombotic brain infarction (ABI) and lacunar stroke (LS) and normal control individuals and the hereditary susceptibility of HLA-DQA1 alleles to those diseases. METHODS: The allelic typing of HLA-DQA1 was detected by PCR-SSP in 155 cases of EH, ABI and LS and 64 normal individuals. RESULTS: The frequencies of HLA-DQA1 * 0301 in EH, ABI and LS groups were obviously higher than that in normal control group (33.6538 vs. 17.9688, 36.5884 vs. 17.9688, 33.0645 vs. 17.9688, P < 0.01). The frequencies of HLA-DQA1 * 0103 in groups of EH, ABI, LS, ABI with EH, and LS with EH were lower than that in the normal control group (6.7308 vs17.1875, RR = 0.3916, P < 0.01; 6.0976 vs. 17.1875, RR = 0.3548, P < 0.05; 6.4566 vs17.1875, RR = 0.3754, P < 0.01; 2.3809 vs17.1875, RR = 0.1385, P < 0.01; 3.5714 vs. 17.1875, RR = 0.2078, P < 0.01. CONCLUSION: HLA-DQA1 * 0301 allele may be a correlative gene with hereditary susceptibility of EH, ABI and LS, and HLA-DQA1 * 0103 allele may be a protective gene of those diseases.
