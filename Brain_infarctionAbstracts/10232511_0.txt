Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of lactate using a zero-quantum/double-quantum filter and generalized spectral localization by imaging (GSLIM) was applied to a model of unilateral stroke in gerbil brain. GSLIM lactate images at 4T clearly reveal elevated concentrations of lactate in the ischemic compared with the normal hemisphere 100-175 minutes after unilateral carotid ligation. These results indicate that the technique is capable of studies of brain infarcts, and that application to human ischemic pathology in brain and other tissues may be possible.
