Following stroke, control of both the contralesional (paretic) and ipsilesional (less affected) arms is altered. The purpose of this study was to analyse the consequences of stroke on joint rotations of both shoulder girdles, that is, glenohumeral (GH) and scapula motion. Because of hemispheric specialization, we hypothesized that changes would relate to the side of hemisphere damage. Nine stroke patients with left, and 9 with right hemisphere damage (LHD and RHD) and 9 healthy subjects were included. Reaching movements to targets positioned close, far and high in three directions were recorded using an electromagnetic system. Initial and final postures of the scapula, GH and elbow joint were evaluated. Inter-joint rotations throughout the movements were analysed using principal component analysis (PCA). The main finding was that initial and final postures of the contralesional and ipsilesional shoulders differed depending on the side of brain lesion. On the contralesional side, there was less scapula protraction and GH lateral rotation for both groups. Scapula tilt was less anterior in LHD patients, and GH elevation was greater in RHD patients. On the ipsilesional side, GH lateral rotation was reduced in both groups, and scapula protraction was reduced only for LHD patients. PCA confirmed that postures of both shoulders of the LHD group were substantially different to the healthy subjects, while only the contralesional arm of the RHD subjects differed. These results add to existing knowledge of hemispheric specialization, suggesting that the left hemisphere plays a greater role in bilateral joint postures than the right hemisphere.
