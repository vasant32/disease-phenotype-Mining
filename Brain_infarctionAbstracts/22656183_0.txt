We report a case of multiple cerebral infarctions as the first symptom of hypereosinophilia with Clonorchis sinensis infestation. The patient showed hypereosinophilia and elevated cardiac enzyme, and the egg test of C. sinensis was positive. CT scans of the chest and the abdomen revealed eosinophilic infiltration in both lung and liver. Over a period of six weeks after praziquantel medication, he recovered. C. sinensis infestation which is endemic in East Asian countries should be considered as a cause of multiple microembolic stroke associated with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.
