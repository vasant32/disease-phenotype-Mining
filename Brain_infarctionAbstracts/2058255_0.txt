This is a case report of a 25-year-old female with recurrent episodes of transient cerebral ischemia accompanied by transient hemiparesis. Cardiac ultrasound examination revealed a small left-ventricular tumor located between the chordae tendineae. The echocardiographic finding was subsequently confirmed by surgery. The entire tumor was removed and the mitral valve remained intact. Due to the histological and immunohistochemical findings a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed. The early and late postoperative course was without event.
