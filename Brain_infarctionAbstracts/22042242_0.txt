The aim of this pilot study was to investigate olfactory function in unselected, cooperative patients with ischemic stroke and to gain information about olfactory perception in patients with distinct stroke localizations. Three ischemic stroke patients underwent olfactory testing using the Sniffin' Sticks test and olfactory event-related potentials recording. All stroke patients were found to be normosmic or only slightly hyposmic when using a psychophysical testing device with age-adjusted norms. No responses or longer latencies on the affected side were found, however, when recording evoked potentials. This seems to argue for the idea that on the affected side it is often possible to document the objective lesion although the subjective perception of the patient appears normal.
