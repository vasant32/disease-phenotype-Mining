In four patients, 2 women aged 24 and 35 and 2 men aged 37 and 47 years, an ischaemic stroke was observed and an atrial septal aneurysm was found as a possible cardiac source of embolism to the brain. Atrial septal aneurysm is a bulging of the fossa ovalis region, that can be visualised by (preferably transoesophageal) echocardiography. In the four patients there were only few other risk factors for ischaemic stroke (migraine, smoking, oral contraceptives). Cerebral angiography was normal in all cases. Recent literature suggests that a causal relationship exists between atrial septal aneurysm and ischaemic stroke. It is still uncertain what treatment is best.
