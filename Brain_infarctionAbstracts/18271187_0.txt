I1-6 in blood serum 109 patients with ischemic stroke was tested on 1st and 7 day after developing the disease. The decrease in concentration of I1-6 on 7 day was found after a complex therapy with Flogensim in the study group in comparison with the control group where a traditional therapy was used. The authors found considerable difference in consequences of the ischemic stroke on 21 day among patients pertaining to different group: the number of patients of the study group where results were better increases and number of the patients of this group with no dynamic or even worsening in neurological status decreases.
