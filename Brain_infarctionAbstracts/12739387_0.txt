A 76-year-old man with left internal carotid artery occlusion developed a progressing right hemiparesis. Brain MRI presented reinfarctions in the left anterior border zone and terminal zone in the left deep white matter. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed a decrease in systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mmHg one hour after starting meals, which is considered as postprandial hypotension. The recurrent stroke occurred probably by a hemodynamic mechanism with the presence of internal carotid artery occlusion and postprandial hypotension. Administration of voglibose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, improved postprandial hypotension. In patients with severe carotid or intracranial artery disease, the postprandial hypotension should be carefully monitored for prevention of hemodynamic brain ischemia.
