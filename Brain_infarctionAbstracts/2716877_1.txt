Six patients are described with delirium after cerebral infarction. Five had a right-sided parietal infarction with involvement of the inferior parietal lobule. One patient presented with a right-sided medial temporo-occipital infarction. The mild neurological signs were dominated by the delirium. The outcome was good in all patients. Delirium after cerebral infarction is probably caused by injury to one of the convergence sites for integration of sensory information with disturbance of the directed attention to relevant stimuli. These sites are localized in the right parietal cortex and the medial temporo-occipital regions. This cause of delirium is probably compatible with the supposition that the right hemisphere is mainly responsible for the distribution of directed attention within extrapersonal space. The importance of an accurate neurological examination in delirious patients is emphasized.
