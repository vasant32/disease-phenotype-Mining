 BACKGROUND: Previous clinicopathological studies have reported central hypoventilation alongside unilateral infarcts in the caudal brainstem. As already known, the respiratory centers are located in the medullary and pontine centers. METHODS: We sought patients with acute respiratory failure with brainstem involvement proved by MRI from 4,500 patients with first ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to our stroke unit over a period of 7 years. RESULTS: We report six patients with a unilateral dorsolateral medulla oblongata lesion, completely sparing the corticospinal tract, who presented impairments in automatic and voluntary respiratory movements. Topographical analysis showed involvement of the nucleus and tractus solitarius,nucleus ambiguus and retroambiguus,nucleus reticularis medulla oblongata, and nucleus tractus solitarius. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into the central organization of respiratory control in the dorsolateral medulla oblongata in humans, and the importance of critical respiratory management in these patients.
