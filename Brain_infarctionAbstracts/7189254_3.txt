Left homonymous hemianopia, hemiparesis, left-body clonic seizures, and progressive deterioration of consciousness complicated the clinical course of a 57-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Clinicians and pathologists should consider this unusual vascular mechanism of cerebral injury in patients with SLE who develop strokes.
