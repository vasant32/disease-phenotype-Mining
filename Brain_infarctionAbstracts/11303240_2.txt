78 autopsy proven cases of infective endocarditis (IE) seen during 1983 to 1995 were retrospectively reviewed. The brain was available for examination in 44 cases. In the remaining cases, brain was not examined because examination of it was not requested due to lack of neurological findings. Brain lesions were observed in 35 out of 44 cases of IE. Assuming remaining 34 cases to be without brain lesions, the brain involvement in IE would be 44.87% (35 out of 78 cases). Mean age of all cases of IE and those with brain lesions was similar i.e. 26.5+/-16.6 years and 26.6+/-13.06 years respectively. Largest number of cases with neuropathological lesions were associated with normal valve IE (48.57%). Mitral valve was most commonly involved in cases with CNS complications (57.14%) (p<0.05). The various types of brain lesions were infarction (68.57%), haemorrhage (57.14%), cerebral micro-abscess (31.42%) and focal meningitis (14.28%). More than one type of lesion was observed in 19 cases, indicating complicated nature of brain lesions in fatal cases of IE. Left sided middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory was the commonest site of infarction and haemorrhage. Staphylococcus aureus appeared to be the most common organism in fatal cases of IE. Normal valve IE with or without CNS complications constitutes a significant group in India and is different from the west as far as the predisposing conditions are concerned.
