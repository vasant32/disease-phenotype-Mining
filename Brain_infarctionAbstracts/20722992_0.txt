Idiopathic perinatal cerebral infarction is recognized to be more common in the preterm infant than previously realized. However, the pathogenic mechanisms and the onset time remain unclear. We encountered an extremely low birth weight female infant with severe intrauterine growth retardation and brain infarction localized on the left inferior temporal gyrus. The onset of the infarction and the precise sequential changes were evaluated with blood data, cranial ultrasound imaging, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. This is the first published fetal case with brain infarction specifically localized on the left inferior temporal gyrus. Careful observation with serial brain imaging is indispensable for high-risk infarction groups, such as preterm infants with severe intrauterine growth retardation, to detect neurological abnormality earlier and precisely.
