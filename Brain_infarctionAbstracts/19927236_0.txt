Bipolar disorder occurs in the elderly ages and is frequently associated to a brain injury -cerebrovascular disease. Its diagnosis is based on the finding of an ischemic injury in specific regions of the brain. The case of a 63-year-old male with cardiovascular risk factors, who was admitted due to maniform picture during a two-year long bipolar affective syndrome is presented. The neuroimaging tests showed lacunar infarction in the right thalamus and diffuse foci of ischemia in subcortical white matter having right predominance. Due to the refractoriness to psychodrugs of an endogenomorphic depressive episode, electroconvulsive therapy was prescribed, with normalization of motor component, although without mood stabilization. The therapeutic strategies and the evolution of this form of bipolarity are discussed.
