Nicotiflorin is a flavonoid glycoside extracted from a traditional Chinese medicine Flos Carthami. In the current study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of nicotiflorin on a transient focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model in rats. Nicotiflorin (2.5-10 mg/kg) administered after onset of ischemia markedly reduced brain infarct volume by 24.5-63.2% and neurological deficits. Also the effect of nicotiflorin on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, mRNA and protein expression after hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R) treatment was investigated in an in vitro model mimic cerebrum ischemia-reperfusion in vivo. After total 4 h hypoxia and 12 h reoxygenation, eNOS activity, mRNA and protein levels in the primarily cultured rat cerebral blood vessel endothelial cells treated with nicotiflorin (25-100 microg/ml) 2 h after onset of hypoxia were significantly higher than eNOS activity, mRNA and protein levels in the pure H-R cells and also higher than eNOS activity, mRNA and protein levels in cells cultured under normoxic conditions. The results demonstrated that nicotiflorin had a protective effect against cerebral ischemic damage. The results also gave an important elucidation for the mechanism underlying the protective effect at the cellular level.
