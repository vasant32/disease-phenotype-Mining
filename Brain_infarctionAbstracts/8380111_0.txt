A 2-month-old girl had focal tonic convulsions. Brain CT showed no abnormalities on admission. Three weeks later she got a severe epileptic status. T 1-weighted MRI demonstrated low intensity areas in the right occipital and left frontal regions, and enhanced CT demonstrated low density areas in the same region. An increase of CMV antibody titer in serum suspected CMV infection associated with brain infarction. Then gamma-globulin was given in addition to PB, CBZ, and VPA, resulting in suppression of seizures. At 9 months of age, she had right tonic hemiconvulsions. An increase of CMV IgM antibody titer showed reactivation of CMV infection. Acyclovir and gamma-globulin were given, and her seizures were controlled. However, she showed progressive motor disability with spastic muscle tonus. CT and MRI showed a severe progressive atrophy of the cerebrum and brain stem.
