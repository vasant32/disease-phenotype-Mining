 BACKGROUND: Gallstone ileus is an uncommon complication of gall stones associated with potentially serious morbidity and mortality. CASE REPORT: We reported a 60-year-old male case who presented with renal failure and pain in right hypochondriac region. He also had a history of brain infarcts along with diabetes which is an additional factor for mortality. On Computed Tomography of the abdomen, he was diagnosed to have cholecystocholedochal fistula including air in the gall bladder and obstruction in the distal part of the ileum. Computed tomography plays an important role to make the proper diagnosis and in treatment. CONCLUSIONS: As in our case, diagnosis was challengeable because of renal failure,diabetes, septicaemia and intestinal obstruction (peritonitis). We did surgery on the basis of peritonitis which remains the only choice in such cases. In follow- up of 1 month patient was doing well and asymptomatic.
