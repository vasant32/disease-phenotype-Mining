CONTEXT: Indications and results of carotid endarterectomy have been defined from clinical multicentric trials like the European Carotid Surgery Trialists, North-American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial and Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study. The patients included in these trials were highly selected, as were the surgeons performing the operations. Clinical practice is different but the same results should be achieved. OBJECTIVE: To study indications, technique, early and late results, and whether carotid endarterectomy has been performed in accordance with standards defined by multicentric trials. DESIGN: Retrospective case report study. SETTING: A tertiary care private hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 57 patients, on whom 70 carotid endarterectomies were performed over a 10-year period. The median age was 66.4 +/- 7.8 years; 43 (75.4%) were male, 41 (71.9%) hypertensive, 36 (63.1%) current smokers and 24 (21.0%) had diabetes. Bilateral carotid stenosis was present in 31 (54.3%) patients, peripheral arterial occlusions in 32 (56.1%) and ischemic cardiopathy in 25 (43.1%). All patients had had angiography and 41 (71.9%) had also had a duplex-scan of neck arteries. Cerebral imaging via computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging was obtained for 36 patients. Patients were followed up over a period of one to 122 months. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: early and late post-operative death, early and late post-operative stroke, and recurrence of atheroma plaque and symptoms relative to carotid stenosis. RESULTS: There was one post-operative death (1.4%) caused by myocardial infarction and two early strokes (2.8%): a total complication rate of 4.2%. After 3 and 5 years, 95.4% and 81.3% of patients respectively were stroke-free and 72.8% and 67.3% were alive. There were four recurrences and two of them related to stroke. Forty-nine (70%) stenoses operated on were symptomatic. Brain infarction was detected in 59.2% of patients who underwent computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy was done in accordance with international standards. The most frequent cause of late death was myocardial infarction, and recurrences were related to stroke. Patients should be followed up closely.
