A 46-year-old man presented with acute confusional syndrome, ataxia, dysarthria, and right hemiparesthesia. Brain MRI showed small bilateral infarcts and fluorescein angiography revealed multiple peripheral retinal infarcts bilaterally. No visual loss was present, and no other organs were involved. The diagnosis of Susac syndrome (microangiopathy of the brain, retina and cochlea) was made and immunosuppressive therapy begun.
