 OBJECTIVE: To study ultrastructured change and neuron apoptosis after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in the aged rats. METHODS: The aged SD rats (20-21 months) and the young (4-5 months) were subjected to 3 hours of middle cerebral artery occulsion with the intraluminal filament technique, followed by reperfusion for 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours. The ultrastructure of brain, infarct zone and neuron apoptosis were observed. RESULTS: The cerebral infarct zone increased in the aged rats with ischemia for 3 hours and I/R for 12 hours compared with those in the young. The brain injury was obviously deteriorated with I/R time longer, which was serious in the aged than that in the young. The neuron apoptosis increase with I/R time longer, and showed earlier and lasted longer in the aged. CONCLUSION: The cerebral injury is serious and neuron apoptosis increase shows early and lasts longer.
