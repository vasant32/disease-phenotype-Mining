Calcium-related mechanisms are an integral part of metabolic reactions during acute cerebral infarction. In an animal model of stroke, the calcium antagonist isradipine was shown to protect neurons against ischaemia. In order to improve the neurological and functional outcome of human stroke patients, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study was started in up to 600 patients with acute ischaemic brain infarction. Since early treatment is considered to be of great importance, patients must be recruited no more than 12 hours after stroke onset. Medical, ECG, laboratory, neurological and functional evaluations are conducted for up to 90 days after stroke.
