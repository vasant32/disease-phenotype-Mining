 UNLABELLED: To study the changes of the expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and pathology in temporal infarction of rats photochemically induced and the effects of batroxobin. METHODS: Immunohistochemical technique and hematoxylin-eosin stain was used to show the changes of the expression of GAP-43 and pathology. RESULTS: In infarction group, GAP-43 expression was markedly increased on the infarction and surrounding tissues at 24 h cerebral infarction. The expression reached peak level at 72 h after cerebral infarction and was decreased at 7 d after cerebral infarction. However, in batroxobin-treated group, GAP-43 expression was increased and the pathological changes were much slight as compared with infarction group. CONCLUSION: The expression of GAP-43 increases in infarction of temporal neocortex and batroxobin promotes the expression of GAP-43 and ameliorates the pathological changes in infarction of temporal neocortex.
