"Lacunar stroke" is described and 4 characteristic lacunar syndromes are presented. These small infarcts frequently occur in patients with essential hypertension. At their peak they cause a relatively minor neurologic deficit and are followed by almost complete recovery. Arterigraphic examination is not indicated as only the small arteries are involved. Treatment consists exclusively of control of hypertension. The prognosis is usually good. The small infarcts arise from pathologic changes and occlusions of penetrating arteries. Localization of the pale softenings which produce the typical lacunar syndromes is briefly discussed.
