Microgliocytes are currently known as structurally labile cells, that, by changing the length of their processes, control the synaptic organization of the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate structural organization of microglia of the striatum and of the forebrain periventricular area in rat following transitory focal ischemia. In the absence of brain infarction, ischemic lesion was found to activate microglia, which contributed to rearrangement of striatal neuropil. As microgliocytes became activated, they changed their shape from characteristic dendritic one to oval and rounded, which are typical to amoeboid microglia. Microgliocytes were shown to be capable of proliferation.
