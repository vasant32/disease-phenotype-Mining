A prospective study of all stroke cases in the Espoo--Kauniainen area (population 113 000) in South-Finland was carried out during 1972 and 1973 by the WHO stroke register method. 286 stroke patients were registered; 61% of them had a brain infarction, 16% an intracerebral haemorrhage and 15% a subarachnoid haemorrhage. The total incidence was 200/100 000/year after age adjustment of the results to the population of Finland. The incidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage, 23.9/100 000/year was especially high. The mortality within three months was 40%, and that after median follow-up periods of four and six years was 62% and 67% respectively. In the intracerebral haemorrhage group the 3-month mortality was very high (72%), but it did not change during the follow-up period. In the subarachnoid haemorrhage group the 3-month mortality was 43%, which increased slightly, but in the brain infarction group the 3-month mortality of 30% increased steadily up to 66% during the follow-up period. The causes of death after the acute stage were cardiovascular as often as cerebrovascular. After four and six years, 71% of the survivors were fully independent in activities of daily living. After four years 21% had even returned to work. 16% of the survivors were still working after six years.
