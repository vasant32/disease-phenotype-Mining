Blood and plasma from 193 patients at risk of cerebrovascular disorders and 87 patients with brain infarction were tested to study prostacyclin (PGI2) degradation. It has been reported that patients at risk for cerebrovascular disorders and especially with brain infarction have an enhanced velocity of PGI2 degradation. The increase in velocity was more marked in blood than in plasma. A direct relation between this enhancement and the manifestation of intravascular platelet activation was observed. These data suggest that elevated PGI2 degradation might be a risk factor for thromboembolic events in patients with cerebrovascular disorders.
