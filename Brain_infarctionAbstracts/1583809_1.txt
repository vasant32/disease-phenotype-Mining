A new method of quantifying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measurements by N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) SPECT with a rotating gamma camera was designed. By assuming the 2 compartment model of the kinetic for 123I-IMP, two parameters of rCBF and distribution volume (Vd) of 123I-IMP from brom brain tissue to blood were obtained by the look-up table method and were derived from two simultaneous equations of the early and delayed images. The rCBF values of 3 cases (two normal adults and one brain infarct patient) were calculated by this method and were compared with the values of positron emission tomography (PET) measured at the same time. The average rCBF values in gray and white matter by this method were 40 ml/100 g/min, 27 ml/100 g/min, respectively and correlated significantly to rCBF values by PET (r = 0.598 (p less than 0.001)).
