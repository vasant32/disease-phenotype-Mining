To address the role of oxidative DNA damage in focal cerebral ischemia lacking reperfusion, we investigated DNA base and strand damage in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Contents of 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic abasic sites (AP sites), hallmarks of oxidative DNA damage, were quantitatively measured in nuclear DNA extracts from brains obtained 4-72 h after MCAO. DNA single- and double-strand breaks were detected on coronal brain sections using in situ DNA polymerase I-mediated biotin-dATP nick-translation (PANT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Levels of 8-OHdG and AP sites were markedly elevated 16-72 h following MCAO in the frontal cortex, representing the peri-infarct region, but levels did not significantly change within the ischemic core regions of the caudateputamen and parietal cortex. PANT- and TUNEL-positive cells began to be detectable 4-8 h following MCAO in the caudate-putamen and parietal cortex and reached maximal levels at 72 h. PANT- and TUNEL-positive cells were also detected 16-72 h after MCAO in the lateral frontal cortex within the infarct border, where many cells also showed colocalization of DNA single-strand breaks and DNA fragmentation. In contrast, levels of PANT-positive cells alone were transiently increased (16 h after MCAO) in the medial frontal cortex, an area distant from the infarct zone. These data suggest that within peri-infarct brain regions, oxidative injury to nuclear DNA in the form of base and strand damage may be a significant and contributory cause of secondary expansion of brain damage following permanent focal ischemia.
