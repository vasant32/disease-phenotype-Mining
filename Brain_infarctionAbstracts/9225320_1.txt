We report a patient with repeated venous infarcts in the occipital lobe and occlusion of the superior vena cava. The pathogenetic relationships between the superior vena cava occlusion and the brain infarcts are discussed. High pressure in the superior venous territory and incomplete patency of the transverse sinus are probably responsible for the venous infarcts.
