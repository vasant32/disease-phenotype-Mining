BACKGROUND: The relation between seizures and small subcortical infarcts is uncertain. The present retrospective study investigates whether differences are observed between patients with and without seizures following a lacunar stroke. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with seizures and a prior history of a lacunar stroke were admitted to the Ghent University Hospital during 2000 and 2005. They were compared to 205 patients, admitted between 2002 and 2004, with an acute lacunar stroke and without epileptic spells on follow-up. Nine out of the 37 patients with seizures and 48 out of the 205 without seizures had a history of recurrent strokes. RESULTS: No differences in vascular risk factors, distribution and frequency of the lacunes, degree of severity of the white matter changes and outcome were observed. On the Mini-Mental State Examination moderate to severe cognitive disturbances were observed in the seizure group and in some patients of the non-seizure group. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we found no evidence that seizures are directly induced by lacunar infarcts. The seizures appear to be part of a more global ongoing cerebral disorder probably leading to cognitive impairment.
