A complete registration of all deceased patients at intensive care units in the Southern Health region of Sweden has shown that 3,114 patients died during the five years from 1999 to 2003. Only 174 cases (5.6 per cent) were classified as potential organ donors according to the definition of total brain infarction (brain death) without medical contra-indications against organ donation. Consent for organ donation was given in slightly more than half of these cases. In 42 per cent of the cases relatives were not aware of the attitude of the deceased, and in 40 per cent of these cases they used their right of veto against organ donation. Corresponding registration, as part of the computerised system for quality assurance for intensive care (PASIVA), may become a national and complete quality assurance for organ donation in Sweden.
