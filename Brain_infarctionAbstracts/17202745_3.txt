The effects of edaravone, a curative agent for acute brain infarction, on singlet oxygen ((1)O2) released from activated human neutrophils were examined, and the effects were compared to those of histidine, a (1)O2 singlet oxygen scavenger. The neutrophils, stimulated with opsonized zymosan, released (1)O2 that was detected by chemiluminescence using a (1)O2 specific probe, trans-1-(2'-methoxyvinyl)pyrene. Edaravone dose-dependently suppressed the (1)O2 release with an IC(50) of approximately 0.3 microM, while the IC(50) of histidine was approximately 1 mM. This (1)O2 scavenging activity of edaravone might be involved in its curative effects on acute brain infarction.
