 BACKGROUND: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) affects predominantly the parietal and occipital lobes. Frequent clinical features are epileptic seizure, altered mental status and visual disturbances. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present the first case of a patient with pericarditis and mitral valve insufficiency, who developed PRES after application of a glycerolnitrate patch day three post-operatively and whose neurological deficits improved within 2 days after withdrawal of patch therapy. CONCLUSION: The precise pathomechanism of PRES is unknown. The lower sympathetic innervation of the posterior circulation may be one explanation for its particular vulnerability to vasodilatation caused by glycerolnitrate.
