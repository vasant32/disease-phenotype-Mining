OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether preoperative CT evidence of brain infarction is associated with an increased risk of early and late stroke and death in patients undergoing CEA. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 844 CT scanning records from 893 patients undergoing CEA from 1986-1994: 43% (367) CT positive for cerebral infarction and 57% (477) negative. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for risk factors and preoperative symptoms in patients with positive and negative CT scans, and Kaplan Meier survival curves for late events. RESULTS: A positive CT was significantly more frequent in males vs. females (p < 0.0001; O.R. 2.52; C.I. 1.73-3.73), diabetics vs. non-diabetics (p = 0.03; O.R. 1.52; C.I. 1.03-2.26), symptomatics vs. asymptomatics (p < 0.001; O.R. 2; C.I. 1.93-3.53) and contralateral occlusion vs. patency (p < 0.001; O.R. 2; C.I. 1.30-3.10). The perioperative disabling stroke/ death rate was higher in patients with a positive CT (p = 0.002; O.R. 6.27; C.I. 1.73-34.20); in asymptomatic patients this difference was striking (5 patients vs. O, p = 0.0002). Multiple logistic regression analysis for risk factors, CT findings, symptoms preceding surgery, and congruity of brain infarction confirmed a significantly higher incidence of perioperative stroke/death rate (p = 0.003; O.R. 6.37; C.I. 5.12-7.63) and early and late stroke (p = 0.02; O.R. 1.95; C.I. 1.38-2.53) and death (p = 0.0005; O.R. 2.38; C.I. 1.89-2.88) in patients with brain lesions. After 7 years, the survival rate (p = 0.0009) and stroke-free interval (p = 0.003) were lower in patients with a positive CT. After 5 years, in asymptomatic patients the survival rate (p = 0.003) and stroke-free interval (p = 0.01) were lower in the positive CT group. CONCLUSIONS: A positive CT finding, regardless of congruity of the lesion, should be regarded as an indicator of an increased risk of stroke and death in patients scheduled for carotid surgery, especially in those with asymptomatic stenosis.
