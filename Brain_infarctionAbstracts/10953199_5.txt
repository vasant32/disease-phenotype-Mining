The authors report 12 patients with acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts in posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory. They found three topographic patterns: A) bilateral medial PICA in six patients; B) unilateral whole + contralateral medial PICA in four; and C) bilateral small multiple in two. Nine patients in Groups A and B had unilateral PICA or vertebral artery disease, and both patients in Group C had bilateral vertebral artery disease. These findings support that unilateral supply to both medial PICA territories may be the most relevant pathogenesis of this syndrome.
