This study reports a patient with a unilateral left thalamic lesion which was centred on the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus. Cognitive neuropsychological assessment revealed a severe impairment in verbal memory and symptoms of executive dysfunction, in the presence of relatively intact visual and facial recognition, working memory, praxis, language and IQ. Verbal and visual recognition memory were investigated using the remember-know paradigm. The results indicated a profound impairment in recollection-driven verbal recognition memory. These results are discussed in the context of the role of the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus in recognition memory, and functional models of memory.
