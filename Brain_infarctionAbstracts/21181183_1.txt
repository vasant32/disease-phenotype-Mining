This study examines the association between thrombolysis and visuoperceptual functions in right hemisphere (RH) infarct patients. Fifty-six consecutive patients with first acute RH infarct were matched for age, years of education and stroke severity at the time of admission to the emergency department (baseline NIHSS; National Institute of Health Stroke Scale), compared according to whether (T+) or not (T-) they received thrombolysis. Neurological (NIHSS at hospital ward; Barthel index; BI) and neuropsychological examinations were conducted 4 days after onset. Visuoconstructive abilities were assessed with the block design and visual search and reasoning with the picture completion subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revised. Visual neglect was assessed with the conventional subtests of the Behavioural Inattention test and visual memory with the visual reproduction subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised. T+ and T- patients did not differ in baseline NIHSS, age, years of education, hemianopia, hemiparesis, or in basic ADL (BI). T- patients had more severe strokes (NIHSS at hospital ward) and poorer visuoconstructive abilities than T+ patients. Our results indicate that thrombolysis has a favourable effect on visuoperceptual functions in acute stroke.
