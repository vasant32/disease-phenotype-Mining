The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) and the value of preoperative spirometry to predict PPC after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Sixty-four of 1372 patients (8%) showed abnormal spirometry data. One out of 1372 patients developed aspiration pneumonia. The patient had high risk factors for serious PPC such as ASA physical status 4.84 y/o, longer anesthesia duration (230 min), multiple brain infarction and low albuminemia. Thirty to 39% of patients with abnormal spirometry showed less severe PPC such as atelectasis, lung collapse and pleural effusion, and incidence was the similar with normal lung function patients. Postoperative blood gas analysis showed a slight increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension during oxygen therapy. However, none of the patients with abnormal spirometry and less severe PPC developed manifest PPC (pneumonia, respiratory failure). Less severe PPC disappeared within second to third postoperative days. We conclude that laparoscopic intervention significantly reduced the incidence of severe PPC and the preoperative spirometry was not recommended in patients with no pulmonary symptoms.
