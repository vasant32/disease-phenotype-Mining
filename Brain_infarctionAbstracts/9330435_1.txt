Plasma lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations are genetically determined, and hyper-Lp(a)-emia is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and thrombosis. To study the implications of Lp(a) in cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), we examined plasma Lp(a) levels and molecular weights of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] in 118 patients with CVD, and 125 cases with DM. Although mean Lp(a) concentrations were higher in those cases with atherothrombotic brain infarction than in those with brain hemorrhage and lacunar infarction, the difference was not statistically significant. Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in the DM cases treated with insulin and in those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents than in those on diet therapy alone, suggesting that insulin and oral agents modulate apo(a) expression. Lp(a) concentrations correlated significantly with the low-molecular-weight isoforms of apo(a) in all CVD and DM groups.
