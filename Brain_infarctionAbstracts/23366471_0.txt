Intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats has been widely used to mimic human ischemic stroke and serves as an indispensable tool in the stroke research field. One limitation of this model is its high variability in infarct volume. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) information after cerebrovascular occlusion may reflect the availability of collateral circulation, which serves as a key factor for brain infarct volume. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is a valuable tool for full-field imaging of CBF with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this paper, we investigated the spatio-temporal changes of CBF in rat MCAO stroke model using our self-developed real-time LSCI system. CBF images of adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n=13) were recorded before surgery, during first 1.5 hours after surgery, and 24 hours after stroke. We compared the CBF changes of different functional vessels during this period. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, CBF of veins and arteries both decreased as expected, while CBF of veins increased after occlusion in the contralateral hemisphere. Moreover, we found a linear correlation between early-stage CBF after occlusion and brain infarct volume, which can be utilized for surgery guidance to improve the uniformity of rat MCAO stroke models.
