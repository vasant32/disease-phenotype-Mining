The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether an acute rise in brain perfusion pressure causes hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct without a reopening of the occluded artery. We raised the blood pressure of 22 cats by aortic obstruction 5-24 hours after transorbital middle cerebral artery clipping; hemorrhagic infarcts were induced in 11. Mean arterial blood pressure increased by 57.2 +/- 16.9 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) in the 11 cats with hemorrhagic infarcts and by 40.4 +/- 16.9 mm Hg in the 11 remaining cats with pale brain infarcts (p less than 0.05). Induction of hypertension increased regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cortical gray matter more in three cats with hemorrhagic infarcts than in seven with pale infarcts. Our results demonstrate that hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct can be induced by a rapid increase in perfusion pressure to brain tissue already exposed to focal ischemia. We also suggest that the restoration of blood flow through leptomeningeal collaterals plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic infarction in cases without reopening of occluded arteries.
