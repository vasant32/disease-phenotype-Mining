Multiple sclerosis (MS) can present with many clinical pictures, but only rarely as a lacunar syndrome. The following case presentation is of multiple sclerosis with initial presentation as ataxic hemiparesis (AH), indistinguishable from the vascular syndrome. This case serves to illustrate that even classic lacunar syndromes can actually be the initial manifestation of multiple sclerosis and that other etiologies besides ischemic stroke need to remain in the differential diagnosis until a definitive has been concluded.
