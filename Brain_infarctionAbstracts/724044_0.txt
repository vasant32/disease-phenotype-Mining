In 54 cases of brain infarction and 17 control cases the gasometric parameters and lactic acid level were determined in arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolic acidosis was demonstrated in the arterial blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Respiratory acidosis compensated partly metabolic acidosis. Changes in the cerebrospinal fluid were more frequent and more pronounced, especially in cases with fatal outcome. Deep disturbances of acid-base balance complicated with hypoxia may have prosnostic significance while moderate rise in lactic acid level is without this significance.
