Developmental venous anomalies (DVA) are congenital aberrations in the cerebral venous system reflecting failure of normal embryogenesis. They are considered the most common intracranial vascular malformation. Although they are generally regarded as benign entities, their clinical significance remains controversial--case reports do exist considering DVA to be the origin of thrombosis, cerebral ischemia, and hemorrhage. We report a 26-year-old patient suffering from thrombosis of a DVA.
