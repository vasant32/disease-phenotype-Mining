1. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of leukotrienes in brain damage in vivo in a model of focal cerebral ischaemia in the rat, obtained by permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery. 2. A significant (P < 0.01) elevation of LTC(4), LTD(4) and LTE(4) (cysteinyl-leukotrienes) levels occurred 4 h after ischaemia induction in the ipsilateral cortices of ischaemic compared to sham-operated animals (3998 +/- 475 and 897 +/- 170 fmol g(-1) tissue, respectively, P < 0.01). 3. The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist SCH 58261 were administered in vivo at doses known to reduce infarct size and compared with the leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor MK-886. 4. MK-886 (0.3 and 2 mg kg(-1) i.v.) and MK-801 (3 mg kg(-1) i.p.) decreased cysteinyl-leukotriene levels (-78%, P < 0.05; -100%, P < 0.01; -92%, P < 0.01, respectively) 4 h after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, whereas SCH 58261 (0.01 mg kg(-1) i.v.) had no significant effects. 5. MK-886 (2 mg kg(-1) i.v.) was also able to significantly reduce the cortical infarct size by 30% (P < 0.05). 6. We conclude that cysteinyl-leukotriene formation is associated with NMDA receptor activation, and that it represents a neurotoxic event, the inhibition of which is able to reduce brain infarct area in a focal ischaemic event.
