The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomical and clinical relationship between lacunar infarction and the corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with acute lacunar infarction and predict clinical outcome. We examined 28 pyramidal tract stroke patients in the acute phase or early subacute phase (<3 days) with a marked motor deficit. The anatomical location and the extent of CST involvement within the infarcts were visualized on three-dimensional colour-coded diffusion tensor tractography (DTT). With regard to the CST, all patients were divided into three clinical subgroups: Group 1 (intact type), Group 2 (partial involvement type) and Group 3 (whole involvement type). Subsequently, the severity of the motor deficit of each patient was determined according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at the acute/early subacute phase (<3 days after onset of symptoms), early chronic phase (8-14 days) and outcome (30-60 days). NIHSS scores of Group 1 (12/28) were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (9/28) at the acute phase or early subacute phase (U = -2.816, p<0.01), and those of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (7/28) (U = -3.136, p<0.01). At outcome,NIHSS scores of Group 1 were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (U = -2.846, p<0.01), and scores of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (U = -3.130, p<0.01). At the same time, the NIHSS scores of each group gradually decreased from acute phase to outcome, Neurological improvement was statistically different among the three topographical types of infarction (H = 26.15, p<0.01; H = 11.03, p<0.01; H = 10.05, p<0.01). In conclusion, the three-dimensional colour-coded DTT allows in vivo differentiation of distinct CST stroke subtypes and may help in better establishing the prognosis for patients after CST stroke.
