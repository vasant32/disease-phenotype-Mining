Eales' disease is an idiopathic occlusive vasculopathy of the retina, which is characterized by extensive peripheral non-perfusion, perivascular sheathing, and neovascularization. It is associated with recurrent vitreous hemorrhages. Both eyes are affected consecutively in 80% to 90% of the patients. In spite of the multiple theories that have been proposed, it continues to have unknown origin and its diagnosis relies on exclusion of other causes of retinal vasculopathy. In some occasions, these patients develop complications of the central nervous system, above all brain infarcts. We present the case of a 38 year old woman with Eales' disease who developed bilateral brain infarcts associated with occlusion or stenosis of the middle cerebral arteries. The cerebral angiography showed beading of the Silvian arteries, suggestive of an underlying inflammatory disorder. Early corticosteroid therapy could avoid contralateral retinal involvement and neurological complications. The patient also presented delayed jaw closing dystonia secondary to basal ganglia infarct which followed a benign course with spontaneous resolution in a few days.
