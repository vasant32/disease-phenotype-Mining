INTRODUCTION: Modifiable vascular risk factors (MVRF) for atherotrombotic or lacunar cerebral infarction have been clearly established, even though only a few population studies have been conducted and we do not know the risk of glycemic status prior to the diabetes mellitus (DM). This study has aimed to determine the relationship between impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and others MVRF with atherothrombotic or lacunar cerebral infarctions. METHODS: A population based case-control study was conducted in two urban health care centers. Cases: 236 patients with atherothrombotic or lacunar CI, diagnosed by computed tomography scan magnetic resonance imaging. Unusual, indeterminate and cardioembolic cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage were excluded. Controls: 441 patients without cerebral infarction, matched by age and gender, selected by means of simple random sampling. The odds ratios (OR) of IFG, DM, smoking, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and obesity were measured with logistic regression. RESULTS: Mean age was 71.1 years old, 62 % being male. Prevalence in cases of MVRF was: IFG, 32.9%; DM, 49.6 %; smoking, 26.3%; high blood pressure, 78.8%; hypercholesterolemia, 29.3%; hypertriglyceridemia, 18.2%, and obesity, 63.5%. All MVRFs were associated in the crude analysis with increased risk of cerebral infarction. In the multivariate analysis, significant associations were found for IFG (OR: 3.2; 95 % confidence interval [CI]:1.1-7.9), DM (OR: 4.5; 95 % CI: 1.4-14.9), high blood pressure (OR: 2.6; 95 % CI: 1.5-4.5), hypercholesterolemia (OR: 2.3; 95 % CI: 1.4-3.9), and obesity (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.0-2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the glucose metabolism IFG and DM are important MVRF for atherothrombotic or lacunar cerebral infarction as seen by the high rate of OR and high prevalence in the population with cerebral infarction.
