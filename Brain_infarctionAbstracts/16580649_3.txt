In acute stroke, the therapeutic time window is a critical factor which may have contributed to the failure of several phase III clinical trials with so-called neuroprotective agents. Since cerebral glutamate levels are elevated for many hours in progressing stroke, we investigated the novel AMPA glutamate receptor antagonist ZK 187638 in rodent models of stroke using up to 12 h delays in the start of therapy after permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). In rats, ZK 187638 reduced total infarct volume by 43% and 33% when therapy was started immediately or with a delay of 6 h, respectively, but no effect was observed after a 12 h delay. Dose-dependent decreases of total infarct volume (up to 42%) were measured in mice given the first injection of ZK 187638 6 h after permanent MCA occlusion. In conclusion, the AMPA receptor antagonist ZK 187638 has a therapeutic time window of at least 6 h after permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rodents.
