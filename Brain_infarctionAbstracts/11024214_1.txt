OBJECTIVE: To detect the relationship between angiotensinogen (AGT) gene CD235 Met-->Thr substitution polymorphism and brain infarction. METHODS: The CD235Met-->Thr substitution polymorphism in exon 2 of AGT gene was analyzed in normal group(82 cases) and brain infarction group (102 cases) by a combination of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism(PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: Between the control group and brain infarction group, chi-square test showed no significant difference in the frequencies of T/T genotype and T allele (P>0.05). However, the frequencies of T/T genotype and T allele (70.6% and 83.8%) for multiple brain infarction patients were higher than those (42.6% and 65.2%) for lacunae brain infarction patients and those (42.0% and 65.2%) for controls (P<0.01). The frequencies of AGT T/T genotype and T allele (65.3% and 78.6%) for patients with brain infarction associated with hypertension were higher than those (42.0% and 65.0%) for patients with brain infarction not associated with hypertension (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: No direct relationship between AGT CD235 Met-->Thr substitution polymorphism and ordinary brain infarction has been observed, but there is a significant correlation between AGT gene T/T genotype and multiple brain infarction, and brain infarction associated with hypertension too.
