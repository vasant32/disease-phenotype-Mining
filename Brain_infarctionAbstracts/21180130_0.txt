 AIM: To learn the condition of the memory and the visual space of the patient who has suffered from the infarction in basal ganglia region, and to analyze its impact on and the characteristics of the patients' cognition. METHODS: By testing respectively on 21 subjects who were initially infarcted in basal ganglia with single focus on one side, and 21 healthy volunteers with corresponding age, gender and educational background with Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Scale (Rey), Clinical Memory Scale (CMS), Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale (HAD), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS), Barthel Index (BI), and Aural Event Related Evoked Potential (AERP) as well. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the patient group got higher scores of anxiety and depression in HAD), which showed absolutely statistical significance; they demonstrated longer reaction time in AERP, which also showed statistical significance; and in CMS. they displayed inferior performance in the free picture recall and the memory quotient (MQ), which again had statistical significance. However, compared with the control group, the patient group got scores with no significance in copy, immediate recall and delayed recall in Rey. CONCLUSION: The infarction in basal ganglia region with single focus on one side may impact on the patient's executive function, memory function and emotion. But no impact is showed on patient's visual space function.
