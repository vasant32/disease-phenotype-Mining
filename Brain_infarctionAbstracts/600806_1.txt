20 patients with ultimately proven cerebral lesion were studied consecutively with 99mTc-pertechnetate and 99mTc-citrate. A comparison of the brain scans showed neoplastic lesions to be visualized more clearly with 99mTc-citrate, and vascular lesions to be demonstrated better with 99mTc-pertechnetate. Comparative brain scanning utilizing 99mTc-citrate and 99mTc-pertechnetate facilitates the differentiation between acute brain infarcts and neoplastic lesions which is difficult or may be impossible by cerebral computer tomography. The reduced radiation exposure from 99mTc-citrate and its superior usefulness in the visualization of neoplastic lesions suggest its use as the primary brain scanning agent.
