Vacuum-assisted deliveries are fairly commonly used in obstetrical practice. Most newborns who have a vacuum-assisted delivery undergo extracranial birth traumas that have no residual consequences. Vacuum-assisted deliveries that complicate intracranial vascular infarction are rarely reported. We present 2 cases of intracranial vessel infarction after vacuum-assisted deliveries. One newborn, with scalp erosion, showed an unusual left middle cerebral artery infarct, and the other, with a severe subgaleal hematoma, had a venous thrombosis. Before the diagnosis, made using brain ultrasonography, neither had specific observable neurological symptoms. In conclusion, vacuum-assisted deliveries should be given special attention, especially when they are combined with a severe extracranial birth trauma.
