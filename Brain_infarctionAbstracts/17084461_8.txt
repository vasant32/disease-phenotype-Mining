Insertion trauma is a critical issue when assessing intracortical electrophysiological and neurochemical recordings. Previous reports document a wide variety of insertion techniques with speeds ranging from 10 microm/s to 10 m/s. We hypothesize that insertion speed has an effect on tissue trauma induced by implantation of a neural probe. In order to monitor the neural interface during and after probe insertion, we have developed a silicon-substrate array with hydrous iridium oxide microelectrodes for potentiometric recording of extracellular pH (pH(e)), a measure of brain homeostasis. Microelectrode sites were sensitive to pH in the super-Nernstian range (-85.9 mV/pH unit) and selective over other analytes including ascorbic acid, Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+). Following insertion, arrays recorded either triphasic or biphasic pH(e) responses, with a greater degree of prolonged acidosis for insertions at 50 microm/s than at 0.5 mm/s or 1.0 mm/s (p<0.05). Spatiotemporal analysis of the recordings also revealed micro-scale variability in the pH(e) response along the array, even when using the same insertion technique. Implants with more intense acidosis were often associated histologically with blood along the probe tract. The potentiometric microsensor array has implications not only as a useful tool to measure extracellular pH, but also as a feedback tool for delivery of pharmacological agents to treat surgical brain trauma.
