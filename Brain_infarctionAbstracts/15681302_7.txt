 OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of monocyte-recruiting chemokines in cerebrovascular diseases among the subjects of the GENIC case-control study of brain infarction (BI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Of the genotypes tested, only homozygosity for the rare CX3CR1 alleles was more frequent in cases than in controls: the I249 and M280 alleles were associated with an increased risk of BI (OR, 1.66 and OR, 2.62 with P<0.05, respectively). This effect was independent of other established risk factors and uncorrelated with disease severity. The study confirmed previous reports of a dominant protective association between CX3CR1-I249 allele and the risk of cardiovascular history. The risk of BI associated with homozygosity for the rare CX3CR1 alleles was enhanced in patients with no previous cardiovascular events. Ex vivo studies showed that the number of monocytes adhering to immobilized CX3CL1, the CX3CR1 ligand, increased proportionally to the number of CX3CR1 mutated alleles carried by the individual. CONCLUSIONS: The rare CX3CR1 alleles were associated with an increased risk of BI and with reduced frequency of cardiovascular history. We propose that the extra adhesion of monocytes observed in individuals carrying rare alleles of CX3CR1 may favor mechanisms leading to stroke.
