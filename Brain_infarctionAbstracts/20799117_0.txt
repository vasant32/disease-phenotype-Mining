Many computational methods for determining the infarct volume from the image of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained brain slices rely on the discretion of the user to determine the infarct region by visual inspection. Once the user determines the infarct boundary by visual inspection, the methods compute the area within the boundary with the assumption that all the spots within the boundary have been infarcted at the same level. However, in the same brain image, partially infarcted spots often tend to appear pinkish whereas fully or severely infarcted spots appear white. We developed a program called InfarctSizer, which automatically detects the infarct region and computes the infarct volume proportional to infarction levels. Comparison of InfarctSizer with other methods shows that InfarctSizer computes the infarct volume more accurately and efficiently than other methods. InfarctSizer and sample brain images are available at http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/brainimage.
