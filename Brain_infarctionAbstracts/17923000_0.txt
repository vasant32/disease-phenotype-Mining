 OBJECTIVE: To investigate dynamic changes of intracerebral focus on cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). METHODS: Using the modified Scheltens scale, the magnetic resonance (MR) changes of lesion distribution, size and shape in 7 patients from a CADASIL family were retrospectively analyzed during 3 years observed. RESULTS: In 6 of 7 patients, the number and volume of lesion areas in the white matter were increased (parietal lobe, n = 6; temporal lobe, n = 5; frontal lobe, n = 3; occipital lobe, n = 2) and some areas even became confluent as a mass or chain. New lacunar infarcts (n = 1 - 5) appeared in 5 patients and the arcuate fiber were involved in 1 patients. Slight enlargement could be seen in lateral ventricle (n = 1) or lateral ventricle with third ventricle (n = 1). CONCLUSION: MR imaging can help us to reveal dynamic changes of brain lesions and prognosis in patients with CADASIL.
