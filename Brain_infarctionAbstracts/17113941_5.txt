We evaluated the effects of two levels of daily forced exercise intensity (moderate and high) in the treadmill over cell susceptibility to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in hippocampal slices from Wistar rats. Moderate exercise decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after OGD, while a significant increase in LDH release was observed in the high intensity group submitted to OGD. Our data corroborate the hypothesis that higher training intensity exacerbates brain damage, while a moderate intensity reduces the injury caused by in vitro ischemia.
