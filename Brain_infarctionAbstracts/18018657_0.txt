Empyema caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains an intractable infection producing high mortality. The authers report a case of MRSA empyema following video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lung cancer. The case was 73-year-old male with some risks such as pulmonary emphysema, decreased renal function, and previous history of brain infarction. He received wedge resection and the staple lines were wrapped with polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt. Ten days after the operation, he was complicated MRSA pyothorax. By thoracoscopic procedures under local anesthesia, fibrinopurulent tissues were cleaned and 3 of chest tubes were replaced. Intrathoracic infected space was cleaned with physiological saline solution. The patient made favorable progress and recovered. Further empyema has not been developed for 24 months. VATS under local anesthesia and irrigation technique was safe and so useful. Nowadays, PGA felt is often used to reinforce the staple lines of lung. PGA felt is an absorbable but artificial material. We have to care about infectious problems. However, we could control the MRSA pyothrax without removing the PGA felt.
