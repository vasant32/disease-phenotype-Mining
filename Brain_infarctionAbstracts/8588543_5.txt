Fifty-six consecutive elderly ( > or = 65 years) patients, admitted for acute stroke to a geriatric department were included in the study and underwent CT scanning. Functional status was graded according to the modified Rankin scale. Three patients had primary intra-cerebral haemorrhage, 22 deep hemispheric infarct, 17 had anterior circulation cortical infarcts, five had posterior circulation infarcts and in nine the CT scan was normal. Stroke risk factors were equally distributed among the different CT scan groups, and all three larger groups had similar rates of non-neurological major complications including death (41%). However, independence in ADL (Rankin 0-2) was observed in 72% of deep infarct survivors, but only 15% of the cortical infarct group (p = 0.00018). For the normal scan group, functional recovery was intermediate. In the cortical infarct group patients with an infarct of > or = 50 mm mean diameter (five cases) should worse functional recovery than did eight patients with small infarcts. The mean difference between pre- and post-stroke Rankin score (DR) was 3.4 for the larger infarct patients and 1.9 for the smaller infarct group (p = 0.027). Pearson correlation revealed a direct relationship between the infarction size and DR (p = 0.039). Such a relationship was not observed for the deep hemispheric group.
