Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is an acute, fulminating form of invasive fungal sinusitis occurring principally in individuals who are immunologically or metabolically compromised. The incidence of pituitary apoplexy ranges from 6% to 17%, presenting as a capsule rupture in up to 1.7-2.0%. Isolated cases of mucormycosis are associated with solid tumors and Cushing's syndrome. A 42-year-old, diabetic woman, with Cushing's syndrome of 5 years duration presented with hemiplexy, hemiparesis and altered speech following a syncopal episode and fall. Brain CT scan showed a left temporal lobe infarction. The patient deteriorated rapidly and she died 4 days later. Autopsy findings included: plurihormonal pituitary adenoma with extension to the sphenoid bone and sellar erosion; many thick, septated, mucormycosis hyphae; and recent fronto-temporal brain infarction. Also, a solitary adrenal corticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing neuroendocrine tumor, 3 cm in diameter, was found in the left lung. This patient illustrates the correlation between ACTH-producing ectopic pulmonary tumor, pituitary apoplexy and mucormycosis.
