Oxygen free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion. We studied the role of endogenous reduced glutathione (GSH) in brain infarction associated with focal cerebral ischemia caused by permanent ligation of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the right common carotid artery (CCA) plus temporary occlusion of the left CCA. GSH levels in the ischemic side of cortex decreased with time after ischemia and preceded cortical infarction estimated by the staining of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. GSH levels in the contralateral cortex were unchanged through the experimental periods. The extent of decrease of GSH levels and the severity of infarction in the ischemic cortex at 24 h after ischemia depended on the duration of occlusion of the left CCA. Depletion of brain GSH with buthionine sulfoximine, a selective inhibitor for gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, exacerbated cortical infarction and edema after ischemia. These results suggest that the endogenous brain GSH is an important determinant in the defense mechanisms against lesion formation after ischemia and support the possible role of oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury.
