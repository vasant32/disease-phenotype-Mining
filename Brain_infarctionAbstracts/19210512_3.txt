 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) contribute to the vascular damage caused by transient cerebral ischaemia. Here we have evaluated the role of PMNs in intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) induced in a model of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) during the acute phase of cerebral ischaemia. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The middle cerebral artery (MCA) of male spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded for 1 h followed by reperfusion and, 5 h later, infusion of thrombolytic products (generated in vitro by t-PA on autologous clots). Effects of pretreatment (before the MCA occlusion) with vinblastine (4 days before; 0.5 mg.kg(-1)), monoclonal anti-neutrophil antibody (mAbRP3; 12 h, 0.3 mg.kg(-1)) or saline on ICH, neutrophil infiltration, MCA vascular reactivity and brain infarct volume were assessed, 24 h after the beginning of reperfusion. KEY RESULTS: Depletion of circulating neutrophils significantly reduced t-PA-induced ICH (vinblastine, 4.6 +/- 1.0; mAbRP3, 5.2 +/- 1.0 vs. saline, 10.8 +/- 2.7 haemorrhages; P < 0.05). This depletion was associated with a decrease in cerebral infiltration by neutrophils and a decrease of endothelium-dependent, vascular dysfunction in isolated MCA, induced by the ischaemia/reperfusion and t-PA treatment. Brain infarct volume was significantly decreased after vinblastine treatment (159 +/- 13 mm(3) vs. 243 +/- 16 mm(3) with saline; P < 0.01) but not after depletion with mAbRP3 (221 +/- 22 mm(3)). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results showed that pharmacological depletion of PMNs prevented t-PA-induced ICH, in parallel with a decrease in cerebral infiltration by PMNs and a decreased endothelial dysfunction in cerebral blood vessels.
