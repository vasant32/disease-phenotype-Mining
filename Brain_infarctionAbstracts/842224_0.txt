Cerebral scanning was performed in 52 cases of brain infarctions (in 43 cases in the system of middle brain arteries and in 9 cases in the vertebro-basillar basin). For this purpose in 46 of the studied cases human albumin serum, labeled readioactive I131 was used and in 6 cases-Tc 99m. Positive scannograms were received only in 16 patients with infarctions in the system of the middle brain arteries. The clinical picture in both groups of patients with positive and negative scannograms did not differ significantly from each other. This may indicate the fact that the process of accumulating radioactive isotopes in brain infarctions depends upon manifold reasons: the state of collateral circulations, the traits of angioarchitectonics in the affected area, the level of metabolism in the focus of lesions, disturbed permeability of the menatoencephalic barrier, etc. In doubtful cases for the differential diagnosis between brain infactions and tumors the most valid criteria in scanning is the dynamics of the focus of accuumulation of radioactive isotopes.
