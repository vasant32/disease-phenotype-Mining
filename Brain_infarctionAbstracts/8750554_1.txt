To assess sympathetic system function after hemispheric brain infarction rostral to the hypothalamus we investigated 24 patients with infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Anisocoria and basal lacrimal gland secretion were determined. The ninhydrin test was performed and the sympathetic skin response recorded in both hands and feet. The functions assessed by these tests were found to be reduced bilaterally. No significant lateralisation of the sympathetic nervous system could be demonstrated.
