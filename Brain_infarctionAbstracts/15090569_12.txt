OBJECTIVE: To study whether lower arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with cerebral white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts. METHODS: We measured SaO(2) twice with a pulse oximeter, assessed the presence of COPD, and performed MRI in 1077 non-demented people from a general population (aged 60-90 years). We rated periventricular white matter lesions (on a scale of 0-9) and approximated a total subcortical white matter lesion volume (range 0-29.5 ml). All analyses were adjusted for age and sex and additionally for hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, pack years smoked, cholesterol, haemoglobin, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. RESULTS: Lower SaO(2) was independent of potential confounders associated with more severe periventricular white matter lesions (score increased by 0.12 per 1% decrease in SaO(2) (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.23)). Participants with COPD had more severe periventricular white matter lesions than those without (adjusted mean difference in score 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 1.16)). Lower SaO(2) and COPD were not associated with subcortical white matter lesions or lacunar infarcts. CONCLUSION: Lower SaO(2) and COPD are associated with more severe periventricular white matter lesions.
