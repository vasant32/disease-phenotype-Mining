We defined whether resveratrol administration during the acute phase of ischemic stroke reduces brain injury in mice. Infarct volumes were decreased significantly in both sexes with different doses of resveratrol (5mg/kg for males and 1mg/kg for females) administered 3h after ischemic stroke. Administration of resveratrol 6h after insult was also effective to decrease infarct volumes. Resveratrol suppressed expressions of IL-1β and TNF-α, microglial activation, and ROS production in the ischemic cortex. The findings suggest that the suppression of inflammation is partly associated with the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol, and resveratrol can be developed as a therapeutic drug for acute ischemic stroke.
