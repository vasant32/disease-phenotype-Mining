 AIM: Foramina transversaria (FT) are located on the transverse processes of     cervical vertebrae. These foramina are known to exhibit variations with regard     to size, shape and may even be absent or duplicated. The aims of this study are     to investigate the shape, size and variations of FT in an ancient population and     to point out the importance of double FT in the human anatomy. MATERIAL and METHODS: 262 ancient skeletons, dated 6th c AD, were unearthed from the Iasos     Archaeological site between 1979 and 1987. Of these skeletons, 22 cervical     vertebrae belonging to 21 individual skeletons were examined for the variations     of FT. RESULTS: Fifteen (68.2%) of the skeletons were male and 6 were female.     All of the FT were round in shape. Among the 22 cervical vertebrae, double FT     was found in 5 (22.7%) vertebrae, while unilateral in 3 and bilateral in 2.     Asymmetrical FT was observed only in one (4.5%) vertebra. The mean diameter of     FT was 6.2 mm in the right side and 6.4 mm in the left. CONCLUSION: Double FT     exists since the antiquity. The recognition of this variation provides safety     and effectiveness for the posterior approaches of the cervical spine.
