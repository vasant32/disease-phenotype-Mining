Acute basilar artery occlusion has a mortality rate approaching 90%. The authors describe a case of acute basilar artery occlusion managed successfully with endovascular embolectomy. A 31-year-old man sought treatment for confusion, dysarthria, and right-sided weakness. He soon became unresponsive and was found to have a vertebral artery dissection and an associated basilar artery embolism. The dissection was managed with endovascular stenting, and the basilar artery embolus was removed with a clot retriever at 7 hours. The patient recovered without neurologic deficit.
