The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) is a recognized risk factor for ischaemic stroke and a predictor of recurrent ischaemic events in young patients, but the significance of positive aCL tests is uncertain in the elderly. We evaluated the frequency of aCL and the risk of recurrence of stroke and other vascular events in a series of 242 consecutive patients aged over 60 years, admitted for brain infarction. All underwent aCL immunoreactivity (ELISA; measured by IgG antiphospholipid, GPL, units) and transoesophageal echocardiography and were later examined or contacted by telephone (mean 2.33 +/- 1.25 years, max. 4). Fifty patients (21 %) had at least l0 GPL units aCL. There were no differences between these and the other patients in the results of transoesophageal echocardiography, including mitral or aortic valvular thickening, atrial thrombus, atrial spontaneous contrast, strands, and aortic plaques thickness. None had IgG higher than 80 GPL units or was positive for anti-beta2 glycoprotein I. Patients with at least 10 GPL units more often had a past history of cerebral infarction than patients lower aCL level. However, the incidence of recurrent stroke was 4.5 per 100 person-year in patients with more than 10 GPL units, and 2.7 per 100 person-year in those with more than 10 GPL units. Kaplan-Meier analysis for any vascular events showed no differences between the two groups. In contrast to young patients, elderly patients with 10 or more GPL units aCL and negative for anti-beta2 glycoprotein I do not seem to have a higher risk of vascular events.
