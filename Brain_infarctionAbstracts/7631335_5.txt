BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We undertook to study the clinical relevance of silent strokes and history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and their individual and combined effects on outcome variables of neurological and epidemiological interest in first-ever stroke patients. METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of data prospectively collected in the Klosterneuburg Stroke Data Bank, a hospital-based registry in Austria that includes a 3-year follow-up program. RESULTS: Of 728 patients (mean age, 68 +/- 10 years) with a first-ever ischemic stroke, 110 (15%) had had a previous TIA, and 66/618 (11%) patients did not have a history of TIA but showed evidence of silent brain infarct on CT. Outcome variables of neurological interest were not significantly different between groups, including time between stroke and study entry, activities of daily living status at first presentation, median time of hospitalization, 30-day mortality, or 3-year mortality. Univariate analyses of epidemiologically important risk factors showed either history of TIA or evidence of silent infarct to be more frequently associated with hypertension (P = .007). Cox models of survival showed that neither history of TIA nor evidence of silent infarct were significantly associated with an increase in 3-year mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Over a period of 3 years, neither history of TIA nor evidence of silent infarct diagnosed at the time of the presenting major stroke in first-ever ischemic stroke patients exert an important influence on neurological or epidemiological outcome variables.
