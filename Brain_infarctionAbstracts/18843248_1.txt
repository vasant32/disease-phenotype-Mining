 OBJECTIVE: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a massive global problem. The mortality and morbidity associated with the severe form of the disease are exceptionally high. Even when increased intracranial pressure is treated and full conventional therapy is commenced, cerebral ischemia can develop and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. We sought to evaluate our experience with two patients with severe TBM and cerebral oxygenation monitoring. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Red Cross Children's Hospital, Cape Town. PATIENTS: Two comatose patients with TBM. INTERVENTIONS: Targeted interventions against low cerebral oxygenation in one patient. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cerebral tissue oxygenation (Ptio2) was measured. In both patients, Ptio2 monitoring demonstrated delayed cerebral ischemia despite the institution of full conventional therapy and the control of intracranial pressure. These data confirm that the vascular involvement in TBM is potentially progressive and that failure to diagnose infarction initially is not merely due to a delay in the radiologic appearance. The first patient developed extensive infarction, consistent with Ptio2 readings, and subsequently died after treatment withdrawal. Intervention in the second patient successfully reversed a precipitous decline of the Ptio2 readings and may have prevented infarction in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: The development of delayed cerebral ischemia in TBM despite treatment is confirmed in these two patients. The reversal of a decline in Ptio2 readings suggests a possible benefit for cerebral oxygenation monitoring in selected patients with severe TBM.
