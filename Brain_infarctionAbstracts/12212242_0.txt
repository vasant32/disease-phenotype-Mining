OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the frequency of prothrombin(F II) gene 3'-untranslated region(3'-UT) G20210A variant and to explore whether this mutation is related to arterial thrombosis in Chinese people. METHODS: We studied 49 patients with thrombosis and 46 healthy Chinese persons. The patients had a first ischemic stroke. The G20210A mutant allele of the prothrombin gene in all blood specimens was investigated by DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification, Hind III digestion and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). RESULTS: The patients and normal control subjects were all homozygous for the normal G20210G allele, and there was no any F II G20210A variant. CONCLUSION: Factor II gene 3'-UT G20210A mutant allele is absent in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke and normal subjects; its mutation may not be a major risk factor for thrombogenesis in Chinese people.
