Migraine with aura (MA) is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in young women with vascular risk factors (smoke, contraceptive pill). Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has also been associated with MA. We describe a 41-year-old man, in good health, with MA since 16, familiar history of diabetes, heavy smoker (30 cigarettes/day). Frequency (1-2 attacks/year) and clinical features of migraine have been unchanged since the onset. A few days before our examination he suffered a typical migraine attack. In the following hours, however, the headache became more and more throbbing and the aura symptoms (regressed as usual in 30 min) reappeared and persisted, so he went to an Emergency Department. The CT-scan (without contrast) was normal. The following days he had visual disturbances and spatial disorientation. We found a normal neurological examination and fundus oculi. He referred persisting visual troubles. We prescribed MR + angioMR which confirmed a migrainous infarction and ruled out others pathological conditions. Further tests found out dyslipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, impaired glucose tolerance. Transcranial Doppler showed right to left shunting. We also prescribed the screening tests for vasculitis (normal). In our opinion this case highlights the relevance of vascular risk factors in MA complications also in male subjects.
