The role of homozygosity for the C677T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene as an independent risk factor for primary and recurrent stroke has been questioned, although recent data appear to be supportive. However, the association of homozygous C677T MTHFR mutation with silent brain infarctions in infancy has not been reported. The authors describe an 11-month-old male who had suffered a silent brain infarction followed by a symptomatic arterial stroke. The evaluation revealed mildly elevated homocysteine levels secondary to homozygous C677T alleles for MTHFR and iron deficiency anemia. An extensive evaluation for other causes of infarction was negative. We suggest that the mother's homozygous MTHFR status played a role in the early onset of stroke and that iron deficiency anemia may have contributed to the recurrence. The patient was treated with anticoagulation therapy, folic acid, and iron supplementation and has not had a recurrent event during 3 years of follow-up. This case provides further evidence that homozygous MTHFR mutation is a predisposing factor for early and recurrent pediatric stroke, including silent infarcts, especially in the presence of other risk factors.
