The white matter lesions in dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) with and without multiple lacunar infarctions were studied relative to a normal control group. The frequency and distribution of white matter (WM) lesions in DAT (22 cases; mean age +/- standard deviation (SD), 88.1 +/- 5.8), DAT with multiple lacunar infarctions (DAT + CVD, 18 cases; mean age +/- SD, 87.8 +/- 6.0), and in a normal control group (17 cases; mean age +/- SD, 85.2 +/- 4.8) were evaluated. The frequency of myelin pallor (frontal, parietal and occipital lobes) was significantly higher in the DAT + CVD group than in the other groups (DAT and controls). There was no significant difference in the frequency of myelin pallor between the DAT and control groups. Therefore, it was concluded that the WM lesions in DAT are the result of ischemia rather than wallerian degeneration.
