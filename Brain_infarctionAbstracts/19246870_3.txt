A 15-year-old girl presented with a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) dissecting aneurysm manifesting as sudden onset of general tonic-clonic convulsion while singing a song. Physical and neurological examinations found headache, vomiting, right perceptive deafness, and right cerebellar ataxia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hemorrhagic mass in the brainstem region, and digital subtraction angiography revealed a fusiform dilatation of the anterior pontine segment of the right AICA. The diagnosis was dissecting aneurysm. Endovascular embolization was performed for aneurysm and parent artery occlusion using a Guglielmi detachable coil and 9 TruFill detachable coil systems, respectively, 2 weeks after occipital artery-AICA anastomosis. No ischemic complications were seen, and her neurological deficits completely recovered after the interventional therapy.
