Metallothioneins (MTs) are small cysteine-rich proteins found widely throughout the mammalian body, including the CNS. MT-1 and -2 protect against reactive oxygen species and free radicals. We investigated the role of MT-1 and -2 using MT-1,-2 knockout (KO) mice. MT-1,-2 KO mice exhibited greater neuronal damage after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) than wild-type mice. MT-2 mRNA was significantly increased at 6, 12, and 24 h after MCAO in the wild-type mouse brain [as detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)], while MT-1 and MT-3 were decreased at 12 and 24 h. In an immunohistochemical study, MT expression displayed colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells (astrocytes) in the penumbra area in wild-type mice. Since erythropoietin (EPO) has been reported to induce MT-1 and -2 gene expression in vitro, we examined its effect after permanent MCAO, and explored the possible underlying mechanism by examining MT-1 and -2 induction in vivo. In wild-type mice, EPO significantly reduced both infarct area and volume at 24 h after the ischemic insult. However, in MT-1,-2 KO mice EPO-treatment did not alter infarct volume (vs. vehicle-treatment). In wild-type mice at 6 h after EPO administration, real-time RT-PCR revealed increased MT-1 and -2 mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex (without MCAO). Further, MT-1 and -2 immunoreactivity was increased in the cortex of EPO-treated mice. These findings indicate that MTs are induced, and may be neuroprotective against neuronal damage, after MCAO. Furthermore, EPO is neuroprotective in vivo during permanent MCAO, and this may be at least partly mediated by MTs.
