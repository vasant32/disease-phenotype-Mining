 AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between ischemic neurodegeneration, of the petrosal ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve, and BP fluctuations, after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MATERIAL and METHODS: Twenty-four rabbits had their blood pressure and heart rhythms studied daily over 20 days. Then, the histopathology of the petrosal ganglion was examined in all animals. Normal and apoptotic neuron density of the petrosal ganglion and blood pressure values were compared statistically. RESULTS: Mean total volume of the petrosal ganglia was calculated as 0.9 ± 0.34/mm3. BP level of control group was 96.1 ± 2.1 mmHg; 116.5 ± 4 mmHg of mild hypertension (HT) group and 128.1 ± 3.6mmHg in the severe HT group. When the groups were compared to each other they were significantly different. The level of normal-apoptotic neuron in control group was 11,240 ± 802/mm³ -40 ± 6.3/mm³; 9730 ± 148.7/mm³ - 1560 ± 256.2/mm³ in the mild HT group and 6870 ± 378.8/mm³-4240 ± 628.2/mm³ in the severe HT group. When the groups were compared to each other there was significantly difference. CONCLUSION: Blood pressure variability observed in this study may be explained by ischemic neurodegeneration of petrosal ganglia caused by SAH. The results of this study suggest that petrosal ganglion ischemia has potential implications for the development of hypertension. These findings suggest that new treatment strategies should be considered for the treatment of SAH.
