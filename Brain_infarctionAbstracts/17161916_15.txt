The proinflammatory and potential neurotoxic cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is produced by activated CNS resident microglia and infiltrating blood-borne macrophages in infarct and peri-infarct areas following induction of focal cerebral ischemia. Here, we investigated the expression of the TNF receptors, TNF-p55R and TNF-p75R, from 1 to 10 days following permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we observed that the relative level of TNF-p55R mRNA was significantly increased at 1-2 days and TNF-p75R mRNA was significantly increased at 1-10 days following arterial occlusion, reaching peak values at 5 days, when microglial-macrophage CD11b mRNA expression was also increased. In comparison, the relative level of TNF mRNA was significantly increased from 1 to 5 days, with peak levels 1 day after arterial occlusion. In situ hybridization revealed mRNA expression of both receptors in predominantly microglial- and macrophage-like cells in the peri-infarct and subsequently in the infarct, and being most marked from 1 to 5 days. Using green fluorescent protein-bone marrow chimeric mice, we confirmed that TNF-p75R was expressed in resident microglia and blood-borne macrophages located in the peri-infarct and infarct 1 and 5 days after arterial occlusion, which was supported by Western blotting. The data show that increased expression of the TNF-p75 receptor following induction of focal cerebral ischemia in mice can be attributed to expression in activated microglial cells and blood-borne macrophages.
