OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term neuropsychological effects and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings among retired patients with a history of exposure to carbon disulfide (CS2). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with a history of exposure to CS2 were divided into two equal groups according to their level of exposure, and they completed a questionnaire and were evaluated for neuropsychological symptoms using the Korean version of the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Thirty-one MRI images were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in total, verbal and performance IQs between high- and low-exposure groups. MRI findings revealed a significantly larger number of cerebral lacunae (five of 12 subjects) in the high-exposure group. Periventricular hyperintensities were mostly located in frontal and occipital areas, and white-matter hyperintensities were mostly in frontal and parietal areas. CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of lacunae in the high-exposure group as revealed by MRI suggests that further MRI studies are needed into long-term neuropsychological effects induced by CS2.
