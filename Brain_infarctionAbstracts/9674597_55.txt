We have recently shown that long-term, but not acute, treatment with lithium robustly protects cultured CNS neurons against excitotoxicity mediated by NMDA receptors. Since NMDA receptor over-excitation has been strongly implicated in the ischemic brain injury, we examined the effects of chronic lithium treatment on neurological deficit and brain infarct induced by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery in rats. Subcutaneous injection of LiCl for 16 days significantly improved neurological deficits, including abnormal posture and hemiplegia, measured 24 h after artery occlusion. Importantly, the size of ischemic infarct was reduced by 56% after lithium pretreatment. These results raise the possibility that lithium may be useful for reducing focal ischemia-induced brain damage and neurological abnormalities.
