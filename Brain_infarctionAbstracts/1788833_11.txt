The purpose of this study was to determine circadian dynamics of platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity in patients with ischemic stroke. The study was carried out in 21 male patients, aged from 51 to 65 years in acute phase of severe hemispheric brain infarction diagnosed clinically and radiologically. The examinations showed that circadian variations of platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic activity were persistent, but the intervals and the degree of oscillation differed from those in healthy persons. The significance of these disorders for clinical purposes was discussed.
