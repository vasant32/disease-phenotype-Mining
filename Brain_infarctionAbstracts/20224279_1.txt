 PURPOSE: The present study investigated the factors related to neurological deterioration in pontine infarction. METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute pontine infarction without basilar artery (BA) occlusion were enrolled. Patients were classified into two groups (D, group with neurological deterioration; ND, group without neurological deterioration). After magnetic resonance angiography was performed to identify the diameters of internal carotid artery (ICA) and BA, the BA diameter/ICA diameter (BA/ICA) ratio was calculated. When the ischemic lesion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging extended to the ventral basal pial surface, it was diagnosed as branch atheromatous disease (BAD). RESULTS: Neurological deterioration occurred in 16 (31%) of 51 patients. BAD was found in 13 (81%) of 16 patients of the D group and 14 (40%) of 35 in the ND group (p = 0.008). The BA/ICA ratio was 0.73 (0.59-0.84) in the D group and 0.64 (0.55-0.71) in the ND group (p = 0.049). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that BAD (OR 15.62, 95% CI 2.37-103.13, p = 0.004) and a BA/ICA ratio of >or=0.70 (OR 7.76, 95% CI 1.55-38.88, p = 0.013) were independent factors associated with neurological deterioration. CONCLUSION: The BA diameter may be associated with neurological deterioration in acute pontine infarction.
