Interlukin-2 (IL-2) is an important cytokine in the brain: IL-2 and its receptors are involved with inflammatory processes. Chronological changes in IL-2 level in serum, and IL-2 and its receptor (IL-2 receptor beta, IL-2Rbeta) immunoreactivities and levels were examined in the hippocampal CA1 region after transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. IL-2 level in serum significantly decreased 12 h after ischemia/reperfusion. IL-2 immunoreactivity was detected in the somata of pyramidal cells in sham-operated group. At 15 min after ischemia, IL-2 immunoreactivity was shown in non-pyramidal cells as well as pyramidal cells. One day after ischemia, IL-2 immunoreactivity was lowest, and IL-2 immunoreactivity is shown in non-pyramidal cells from 2 days after ischemia. Four days after ischemia, IL-2 immunoreactivity was shown in dying pyramidal cells. IL-2Rbeta immunoreactivity in the sham-operated and 15 min-3 min post-ischemic groups is detected in the cell membrane of pyramidal cells. From 3 h after ischemia, IL-2Rbeta immunoreactivity is found in cytoplasm and nuclei, but not in cell membrane. IL-2Rbeta immunoreactivity decreases from 6 h after ischemia and is shown mainly in non-pyramidal cells from 3 days after ischemia. The data of Western blot analyses for IL-2 and IL-2Rbeta was similar to the immunohistochemical data. IL-2 infusion into cerebrospinal fluid did not protect hippocampal neurons from ischemic damage. These results suggest that IL-2 and IL-2Rbeta show malfunction from 3 h after ischemia, and exogenous IL-2 does not protect ischemic neuronal damage.
