BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain infarction localized in the anterior cerebral artery territory is rather uncommon, and its etiology has not yet been fully elucidated. METHODS: Based on computed tomographic findings, 17 patients with solitary anterior cerebral artery territory infarction were selected from among 3,619 patients admitted consecutively to our institute. Patients without angiographic examinations were excluded. The angiographic findings and clinical category of stroke were analyzed in each patient. RESULTS: Angiographic abnormalities were revealed in all patients. These consisted of occlusive changes (n = 10) or reversible segmental dilatation (n = 3) of the anterior cerebral artery, A1 hypoplasia (n = 5), and occlusive changes of the carotid artery (n = 3). In one patient with anterior cerebral artery occlusion, the occluded artery was reopened and subsequently became reoccluded. The clinical category of stroke was classified as atherothrombotic in 10 patients, cardioembolic in three, and undetermined in the remaining four. In eight of the 10 patients with atherothrombotic infarction, the anterior cerebral artery was narrowed or occluded. In all patients with cardioembolic infarction, the A1 segment contralateral to the infarction was hypoplastic. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, solitary anterior cerebral artery territory infarction was attributable most commonly to local atherothrombosis and occasionally to cardiogenic embolism. A hypoplastic A1 segment may facilitate the occurrence of embolism in the anterior cerebral artery. Reversible dilatatory and occlusive changes of this artery may be another important cause of infarction.
