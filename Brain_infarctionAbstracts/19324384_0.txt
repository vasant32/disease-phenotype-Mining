Meningioma, though benign, may invade adjacent structures such as bone, soft tissues, dural sinuses and arteries. However brain infarctions secondary to meningioma involving the cavernous sinus and encasing and narrowing the intracranial carotid artery are rare. We report the case of a young man with recurrent left carotid artery infarctions due to a left sphenoid meningioma infiltrating the posterior optic nerve sheath through the optic canal and circumscribing the intracranial carotid artery. The patient had a gradually progressive occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, the distal internal carotid artery and finally the anterior cerebral artery ipsilateral to the sphenoid meningioma.
