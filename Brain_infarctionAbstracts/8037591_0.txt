Small infarcts, few millimeters in size, localized in the deep regions of brain hemispheres, cerebellum and pons were found in 36 patients with arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis. These infarcts develop in the intracerebral arteries having the diameter up to 500 microns. Two types of these infarcts are distinguished: hypertensive and atherosclerotic. Arterial stenosis and obliteration are at the basis of hypertensive infarcts. Reduction of circulation due to the atherosclerotic stenosis is the cause of the atherosclerotic infarcts.
