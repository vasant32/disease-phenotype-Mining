Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) exerts neuroprotective effects under various neurotoxic conditions in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the effects of VIP on transient ischemic brain damage. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 120 min in the adult rat brain. Either a single intracerebroventricular injection of VIP or saline was given at the beginning of reperfusion. Forty-eight hours after MCAO, the rats were sacrificed for evaluation of the infarct volume and histological analysis. ELISA was performed to assay levels of serum S100B before being sacrificed. We also evaluated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability using Evans blue dye injection method. In contrast to the cases treated with vehicle, the infarct volume was significantly (P<0.05) reduced, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunoreactivity for S100B were also significantly (P<0.05) decreased in the ischemic hemisphere with VIP treatment. In addition, the elevations of serum S100B were significantly (P<0.01) attenuated in VIP-treated rats compared with those of control rats. Treatment with VIP did not result in a significant reduction of Evans blue leakage, although it tended to be lower than that in the control rats. Our data suggest that treatment with VIP reduces brain damage in ischemic rats, and this effect may be associated with the attenuation of apoptosis and S100B expression.
