There were 72 patients (19 with hepatic failure, 10 with fulminant hepatitis, eight with paraquat poisoning, eight with rheumatoid arthritis, five with myasthenia gravis, four with hyperlipidemia, four with systemic arteriosclerosis including brain infarction, three with pemphigus vulgaris, two with multiple myeloma, two with systemic lupus erythematosus, two cases non-specific Ig-G antibody, two cases medication with an anticancer drug, one with multiple sclerosis, one with Crohn's disease with amyloid kidney and one with chronic myeloblastic leukemia) treated by plasma exchange in the Kidney Center, Tokai University School of Medicine from Jan. 1983 to Dec. 1986. We performed plasma exchange using fresh frozen plasma in 40 cases and Lactate-Ringer's solution containing albumin (4.0-5.0%) in 20 cases as the replacement fluid. In 17 cases, we performed double filtration plasma exchange with the recycle system and no replacement fluid. Although PE therapy did not constitute a basic therapy for hyperlipidemia, pemphigus vulgaris, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, it was effective in relieving severe clinical symptoms. At the present time, conventional plasma exchange does not improve the survival rate of patients with hepatic failure and fulminant hepatitis. Developments of a new artificial liver support apparatus and identity of many toxic substances in hepatic failure are necessary. No hypotension, hypovolemic shock or other significant complications were experienced.
