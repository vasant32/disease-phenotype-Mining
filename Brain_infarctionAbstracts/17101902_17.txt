Focal areas of restricted diffusion adjacent to high-grade glioma resection cavities were detected in 70% of patients on immediate postoperative MRI studies. Follow-up studies demonstrated cystic encephalomalacia in 91% of these foci, suggesting the presence of infarction, and the infarcted tissue demonstrated enhancement in 43% of cases. New postoperative deficits correlated well with the anatomic region of infarction in six patients. Enhancement in perioperative infarcts can mimic tumor progression on follow-up imaging studies.
