BACKGROUND: Recent investigations of patients with cerebral and peripheral arterial emboli of unknown cause suggest that paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale might be responsible for more arterial embolic events than previously realized. CASE: A 60-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer presented with sudden onset of expressive aphasia and right upper hemiplegia postoperatively. A patent foramen ovale diagnosed by echocardiography with contrast combined with the presence of thrombosis in her right femoral vein leads us to speculate that her stroke was secondary to a paradoxical embolism. CONCLUSION: Paradoxical embolism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer patients with embolic stroke and it may be appropriate to include a cardiac echo as part of the diagnostic evaluation.
