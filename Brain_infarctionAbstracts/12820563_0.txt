A 47-year-old man lost his consciousness and brought to our hospital by ambulance. On admission, he had aphasia and upper right limb paresis. Diffusion weighted MR image of the brain on admission showed multiple high intensity areas in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Brain angiography performed on the 2nd hospital day revealed the left MCA severe stenosis. We started intravenous antithrombotic therapy on the 1st day. The left carotid angiography on 12th day demonstrated that the left MCA stenosis was improved. He had medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gout. But he had only slight atherosclerosis, and had no arrhythmia and patent foramen ovale. Blood chemistry test showed marked hypoproteinemia and hyperlipidemia, and urine examination showed proteinuria. He was diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome for the first time. Nephrotic syndrome brought hypercoagulability, so we suspected that nephrotic syndrome concerned with brain infarction.
