Bacterial meningitis has special clinical features in the newborn infant. Major complications and sequelae result from the infectious involvement of the CNS in the majority of these children. We studied 109 newborn infants with bacterial meningitis accompanied from January 1977 to April 1987. The mortality rate was 34.8%. Perinatal risk factors were not found. The majority (80.5%) were term newborn infants. The main signs at admission were convulsion (53.2%), bulging fontanel (37.6%) and apnea (20.2%), and the main symptoms were neurosensorial depression (64.2%), nursing refuse (64.2%), fever (50.5%) and irritability (35.8%). Complications during hospitalization were ventriculitis (34.9%), inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion syndrome (27.5%), subdural collection (8.3%), brain abscess (4.6%) and brain infarction (2.8%). Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion syndrome and ventriculitis were closely associated with high mortality. Seventy one children survived: 44 (62%) had gross abnormalities at the neurologic examination, and 29 (40.8%) developed hydrocephalus. Neurological follow-up of these children is important. Prognostic can change along the course of long time follow-up.
