The present study included 1047 elderly participants. At baseline, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to detect infarcts and white matter lesions; further, depressive disorders were assessed. Participants were followed up during 3.6 years to determine incident and recurrent depression. We found an increased risk of recurrent depression associated with silent brain infarcts.
