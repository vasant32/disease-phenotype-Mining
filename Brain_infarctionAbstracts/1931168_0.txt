A 10-year-old girl had an infarction in the left brain during an acute viral meningoencephalitis. She initially showed seizure, unconsciousness and fever, and right hemiplegia gradually developed. She died at the 48th day of disease from respiratory disturbance and renal failure. Cranial MRI during the acute phase of the disease, when there was no clinical sign of right hemiplegia, showed a high intensity lesion in the left parietal and occipital areas on T-2 weight image. Autopsy disclosed the findings suggesting viral encephalitis, including multiple focal necrosis, perivascular round cell infiltration, proliferation of glial cells and spongy degeneration with some intranuclear inclusion bodies, and infarction in the left hemisphere. These findings suggest that T-2 high intensity lesion on MRI reflected infarction.
