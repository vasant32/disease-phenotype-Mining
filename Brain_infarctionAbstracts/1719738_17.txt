The ability to perceive and express emotional, as well as number of linguistic prosodic qualities of speech was tested in 20 Swedish-speaking patients with right-sided cortical, as well as purely subcortical brain infarcts, and in 18 normal controls. The infarcts were assessed by clinical neurological examination, and by CT, EEG, and measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In the patients the identification of emotional messages was disturbed, as well as the identification and production of several linguistic prosodic qualities. The study supports the claim that prosodic impairment could be linguistic in nature, and not secondary to affective disorder. The total degree of anatomical and functional disturbance of the right hemisphere played a role for both the ability to identify emotional messages and for identification of two of the linguistic prosodic qualities tested. However, it was not possible to find support for the hypothesis that the organization of prosody in the right hemisphere mirrors that of propositional speech on the left side.
