The authors assessed liquor biochemical indices, mainly enzymes, on day 1-3 of hemispheric ischemic stroke in correlation with brain infarction size in 90 relevant male patients (mean age 70 +/- 6 years). The brain damage was verified by computed tomography with measuring the infarction lesion. The latter in view, the patients were assigned in three groups: with ischemic lesion less than 5.0 cm3, less than 30 cm3 and greater than 30.0 cm3 or/and multiple lesions. The results were compared with those in patients who had suffered hemispheric ischemic stroke followed by discirculatory encephalopathy.
