In 1891 Georg Avellis described a so-called "laryngeal hemiplegia" that can be caused by peripheral lesions of the vagal and glossopharyngeal nerves and rarely by infarctions of the medulla oblongata, thus representing a classical brainstem syndrome. In this study we describe two patients with an Avellis' syndrome caused by brainstem ischemia. Contemporary publications about Avellis' syndrome in brainstem lesions seem to be very inhomogenous. They report various diseases with unilateral laryngeal palsy due to nucleus ambiguus lesions with diverse additional neurological symptoms. We conclude that according to Avellis' original description only the combination of ipsilateral palatolaryngeal paresis and contralateral hemiparesis and/or hemihypesthesia should to be interpreted as Avellis' syndrome.
