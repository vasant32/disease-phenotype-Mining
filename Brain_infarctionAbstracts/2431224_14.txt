The Levine rat preparation, the gerbil stroke model, and appropriate control animals were used to determine if the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) would selectively identify noninfarcted versus infarcted cerebral tissue. The TTC is frequently used to quantify infarcted myocardial tissue and has been shown to have great specificity, reproducibility, and efficacy. The TTC produces a red product upon reaction with the respiratory enzymes (dehydrogenases) present in non-infarcted tissues. Irreversibly damaged tissues, lacking dehydrogenases, do not form red reaction products. Six gerbil brains and seven rat brains were incubated with the TTC, and the unreacted areas were macroscopically identified. The brains were fixed and sectioned for routine hematoxylin and eosin staining to determine the specificity of the TTC. The TTC was found to react selectively only with non-infarcted cerebral tissue. The gross brain sections were evaluated by macroscopic morphometric analysis, and the unreacted area was always ipsilateral to ligation and correlated with histologic identification of infarct. The brains from neurologically intact animals demonstrated neither macroscopic nor histological evidence of infarction. This technique allows macroscopic quantification of infarct size by planimetry. The average area of infarct for the neurologically impaired rats was 34.7% and it was 31.4% for the impaired gerbils. The percentage of surface area of each infarcted slice was found to correlate with the severity of the neurologic deficit. We conclude that TTC staining is effective for macroscopically delineating cerebral infarcts in rats and gerbils, thus permitting quantification of infarct size.
