Nicotiflorin is a single component extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Flos Carthami. In this study, we investigated its neuroprotection in permanent focal cerebral ischemia model in rats, and in an in vitro model of ischemia. At doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, nicotiflorin administered immediately after the onset of ischemia markedly reduced brain infarct volume and neurological deficits. For primarily cultured neurons suffered 2 h hypoxia followed by 24 h reoxygenation, nicotiflorin significantly attenuated cell death and reduced LDH release. Morphological observation also directly confirmed its protective effect on neuron. These results provided strong pharmacological basis for its potential therapeutic role in cerebral ischemic illness.
