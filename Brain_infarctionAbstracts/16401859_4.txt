The authors studied 14 patients with an isolated cerebellar infarct in the territory of the medial branch of the superior cerebellar artery (MSCA). The most common clinical finding was severe gait ataxia with sudden falling (n = 9) or severe veering (n = 2). Cerebellar dysarthria was found in 8 patients. Eight patients had a mild unilateral limb ataxia. These findings emphasize that MSCA territory cerebellar infarction presented with the prominent gait ataxia and cerebellar dysarthria.
