An 86-year-old man with a history of brain infarction was admitted because of recurrent stroke with symptoms of left hemiparesis. Ultrasonography revealed a mobile thrombus in the brachiocephalic artery. Although anticoagulant therapy was commenced, neurologic symptoms deteriorated suddenly and he died on the third day. Autopsy indicated that the thrombus resulted from plaque rupture in the brachiocephalic artery.
