We report a case of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita secondary to fetal hypokinesia in a 41-week gestation infant following antenatal central nervous system injury. The mother's pregnancy was complicated by an episode of attempted self harm, with an overdose of co-proxamol at 22 weeks of gestational age, and by the use of cocaine in combination with excess alcohol intake. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral mid-brain cysts and marked atrophy of the basal ganglia and thalami.
