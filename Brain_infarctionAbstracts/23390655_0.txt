We examined 80 patients after extensive hemispheric ischemic stroke that occurred at least one year ago. Before admission to a hospital, the patients did not undergo neurorehabilitation. The mean period from the development of stroke till the beginning of rehabilitation measures was 22.5 +/- 8.7 months. The rehabilitation was performed during 45 days using methods elaborated in the Center of Speech Pathology and Neurorehabilitation. The significant improvement of functional abilities assessed by the Barthel scale, which was more expressed in patients younger than 59 years, with smaller volume of brain infarction lesions (r = -0.42; p = 0.02) and less extent of baseline functional deficit (r = -0.42; p = 0.02) was found after the restorative treatment. The improvement of speech functions, which was more expressed in patients with the less severe degree of disorders at baseline; in acoustic/memory and afferent motor forms of aphasia and in patients with pyramidal insufficiency (p = 0.006) and mild hemiparesis (p = 0.005), was noted in 35 (43.75%) of patients). These results suggest using a comprehensive approach to neurorehabilitation and confirm the efficacy of the method used for restorative treatment of patients in the residual period of stroke.
