We previously reported that orthovanadate composed of vanadate (V(5+)) activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases, thereby eliciting neuroprotection in brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, therapeutic doses of orthovanadate are associated with diarrhea due to inhibition of ATPase. By contrast, vanadyl (V(4+)) organic compounds show low cytotoxicity. Since both vanadate and vanadyl inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases, we tested whether bis(1-oxy-2-pyridinethiolato)oxovanadium(IV) [VO(OPT)] in a vanadyl form elicits a neuroprotection in brain ischemia. In a mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, pre- and post-treatments with VO(OPT) significantly reduced infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner. Like orthovanadate, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway mediated neuroprotective action. VO(OPT) treatment inhibited reduced Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 following brain ischemia and restored decreased phosphorylation of forkhead box class O (FOXO) family members such as FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX. Consistent with inhibition of FOXO dephosphorylation, VO(OPT) treatment blocked elevated expression of Fas-ligand, Bim and active caspase-3 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion. Taken together, a vanadyl compound, VO(OPT) elicits neuroprotective effects on brain ischemia/reperfusion injury without apparent side effects.
