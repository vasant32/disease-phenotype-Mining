Visual evoked potentials, including the P300 response, and reaction time were recorded from 20 patients with multi-infarct dementia, 20 nondemented patients with brain-infarct diseases, and 20 age-matched control subjects. Additionally the patients were assessed using the WAIS-index. Prolonged P300 latency and reaction time occurred in both of the patient-groups, correlated significantly with the WAIS-index. However, effects regarding to P300 latency and reaction time were not strong enough to allow individual classifications.
