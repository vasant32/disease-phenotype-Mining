Peri-infarct increase of vascular density has been observed in animals and in humans with ischemic stroke. Increased peri-infarct vascular density correlates with improved functional outcome after stroke. We hypothesized that pre-treatment with estradiol will increase post-ischemic peri-infarct capillary density in a rat model of transient ischemic stroke. Estradiol, compared to placebo, augmented post-ischemic peri-infarct vascular density by 22% 10 days after stroke. Recovery of forelimb function was not improved with estradiol treatment on day three and nine post-stroke. Loss of estradiol may limit repair in the peri-infarct region by limiting angiogenesis, but functional significance in stroke recovery requires further investigation.
