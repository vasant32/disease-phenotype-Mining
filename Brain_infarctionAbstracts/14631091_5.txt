 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current publications suggest increased risk of sudden death in experimental animals with acute right insular lesions and in patients with recent right-sided brain infarction, particularly if the insula is involved. METHODS: Using 3 different time definitions, we related long-term risk of sudden death to presence and side of brain infarction on the baseline brain scan and handedness in 2885 patients with symptomatic carotid disease. RESULTS: In 1295 patients without brain infarction, 5-year risk of sudden death was 5.3% (24-hour definition); in those with left-sided infarction (n=471), 8.8%; in those with right-sided infarction (n=477), 6.0%; and in those with bilateral infarction (n=535), 9.7%. After accounting for differences of other risk factors (eg, previous myocardial infarction) in Cox regression, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) compared with no infarction were as follows: left-sided HR, 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 2.10); right-sided HR, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.47); and bilateral HR, 1.40 (95% CI, 0.98 to 2.00). Insular infarction occurred in 41 patients; none died suddenly. Left-handed or ambidextrous patients (n=183) had a lower risk of sudden death than right-handers; the adjusted HR for left-handed or ambidextrous patients was 0.24 (95% Cl, 0.07 to 0.70). These results were essentially the same for the 10- and 60-minute definitions of sudden death. CONCLUSIONS: In the long-term, left-sided, not right-sided, brain infarction is associated with increased risk of sudden death. Left-handed or ambidextrous patients have a lower risk of sudden death than right-handed patients, suggesting a role for the brain.
