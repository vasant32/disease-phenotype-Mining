The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), predominantly known for its role as an important mediator of immune reactions, is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions. Atherosclerosis resulting in cerebral or carotid arterial stenosis/occlusion plays the most important role in the occurrence of cerebral infarction (CI), and thus TLR4 polymorphisms may influence formation of atherosclerosis and the development of CI. This study was aimed to detect two commonly reported Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile polymorphisms in TLR4 gene in Hunan Han Chinese and their possible relationship with CI. By using the method of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), the polymorphisms TLR4, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, were determined in 366 CI patients and 200 controls from Changsha area of Hunan Province. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) also was detected by Bmode ultrasonography. Our results suggested both the TLR4, Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, genetic polymorphisms were not observed in all subjects from Hunan Changsha. Therefore, we speculate they might not be an important factor in the development of CI in the Chinese.
