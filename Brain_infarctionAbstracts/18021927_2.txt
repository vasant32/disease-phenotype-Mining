Posterior circulation infarction is uncommon in children. Vertebral artery dissection is an unusual cause of posterior circulation infarction in children. We report on a 12-year-old boy with spontaneous left-extracranial vertebral artery dissection associated with isolated ipsilateral superior cerebellar artery territory infarction, diagnosed clinically and by brain computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a flame-like occlusion of the left vertebral artery at level C(2)-C(3), and indicated that artery-to-artery embolus may be a mechanism of superior cerebellar artery territory infarction. We emphasize that vertebral artery dissection should be considered in a child with acute signs of posterior circulation ischemia.
