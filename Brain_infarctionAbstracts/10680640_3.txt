Studies of the factors affecting the first recurrence of ischemic stroke have reported inconsistent findings. Types of initial stroke and the racial differences in study samples are among the explanations that may account for this inconsistency. The aims of this study were to estimate the cumulative recurrence rates of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke and identify the factors that influence the first recurrence of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke in the Taiwanese Chinese population. Four hundred and sixty-six patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke from thirteen hospitals in Taiwan were followed up in this study to ascertain first recurrence of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke between October 1992 and April 1995. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative recurrence rate. The Cox regression model was used to ascertain the significant factors affecting the first recurrence of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The overall cumulative recurrence rate was 10.5% (49/466) from the follow-up period of 30 months. After adjustment for age, sex, treatment modes, and variables pertinent to blood pressure, the site of brain lesion remained a significant factor. The relative risk of first recurrence for the basal ganglion vs. the region of middle cerebral artery was 3.06 (95% CI: 1.29-7.26). The brain lesion site was demonstrated to be an independent predictor of risk for the first recurrence of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke among the Taiwanese Chinese population. Whether this finding was also seen in other populations should be corroborated in future research.
