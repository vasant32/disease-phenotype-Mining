 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lacunar infarcts are usually regarded as benign stroke, but population-based studies are required to assess the exact place of this stroke subtype in cerebrovascular pathology. METHODS: We evaluated trends in incidence rates, risk factor profiles, and survival rates in symptomatic lacunar stroke from a prospective population-based registry from 1989 to 2006. RESULTS: We recorded 2536 ischemic strokes. Among these, 715 (28%) were lacunar infarcts (354 men and 361 women). From 1989 to 2006, we observed a significant rise in the incidence of lacunar stroke in the 2 sexes considered together (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.035; P=0.007), whereas the variation was not significant in either men or women when considered separately. Incidence rates significantly increased in young patients under 65 years old (relative risk, 1.049; 95% CI, 1.0175 to 1.0817; P=0.002). Concerning the distribution of cerebrovascular risk factors, lacunar stroke differed from nonlacunar stroke only with regard to the lower prevalence of a history of atrial fibrillation in the former (P<0.001). For lacunar infarcts, survival rates were 96% at 1 month (95% CI, 0.94 to 0.97), 86% at 1 year (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.89), and 78% at 2 years (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.81) and were significantly higher than those for nonlacunar stroke (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.70 to 2.47; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a significant increase in the incidence rates of lacunar stroke with a relatively good short-term prognosis in terms of survival. The association among hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lacunar stroke was no stronger than the association between these 2 risk factors and nonlacunar stroke.
