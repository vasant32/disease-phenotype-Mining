 BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics and imaging findings of craniocervical dissection in childhood ischemic stroke, in a tertiary medical center. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated children (aged 1 month to 18 years) with symptoms and radiographic confirmation of ischemic stroke from January 1996 to January 2007. Stroke work-up included neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, conventional angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography), cardiac assessment, prothrombotic assays, immunoassays, infection screening, and metabolic screening. RESULTS: Among 95 children with arterial ischemic stroke, arterial dissection was identified as the underlying risk factor in nine patients (7 boys and 2 girls; age range, 1.9 17.2 years). All the patients had focal neurological signs and two had warning symptoms. A history of trauma was noted in two patients and another two had stroke during physical exertion. The other five patients had spontaneous dissection. Six patients had anterior circulation arterial dissection. Three patients had posterior circulation arterial dissection, and the most common location was in the vertebral artery. Antiplatelet treatment was given to five patients and anticoagulants to one. Endovascular treatment was given to one patient with dissecting aneurysm. One patient died at the acute stage and another seven had neurological deficits after 9 months to 8 years follow-up. The ninth patient had no residual neurological impairment. No patients had recurrent stroke. CONCLUSION: Arterial dissection should be considered in childhood ischemic stroke. Spontaneous arterial dissection is an important factor in this group. Early investigation and treatment can improve the outcome.
