 BACKGROUND: Subclavian artery dissection is a rare entity. It is usually associated with anomalous aortic vasculature. Only with trauma or catheterization procedures is subclavian artery dissection with normal aortic vasculature reported. PATIENT: We describe a patient with intrascapular pain, an occipital headache, and 3 distinct infarctions in the nervous system. He had spontaneous subclavian artery dissection with normal aortic vasculature. CONCLUSION: Subclavian artery dissections should be suspected in patients with intrascapular pain, occipital or cervical pain, and symptoms within the posterior circulation.
