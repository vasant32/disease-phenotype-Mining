Memory impairment, headaches and vertigo are considered as initial appearances of chronic cerebral vascular disorder in patients with arterial hypertension (AH). The complex analysis of complaints, cognitive functioning, emotional state and MRI data was conducted in 60 patients with AH, mean age 58,4+/-7,8 years, without a history of stroke and 30 controls matched for age, sex and education. Impairment of cognitive functioning was assessed by the Psychiatric Status Scale (a short version), the Clock Drawing Test, tests of auditory and verbal memory, attention concentration, speed of test performance, speech fluency and spatial orientation. The deterioration effect of systolic arterial pressure on cognitive functioning was found. The lesions of white matter (subcortical and/or periventricular leucoaraiosis) were observed in 76% of patients and single asymptomatic lacunar infarctions--in 20%. Cerebral vascular lesions were correlated with cognitive impairment. Anxiety and anxiety-depressive disorders which were not associated with the cerebral vascular lesion but related in large to the patient's complaints on headaches and vertigo were revealed in 62% of cases. The results of the study suggest that cognitive dysfunction proves to be the early and reliable predictor of chronic cerebral vascular disorder in patients with arterial hypertension.
