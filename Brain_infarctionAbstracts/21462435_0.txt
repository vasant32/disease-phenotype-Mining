One hundred and four patients with acute carotid ischemic stroke were included in the study. Patients were divided into 4 groups. Patients of control group (group 1) were treated with equal basic and reperfusional therapy without any cytoprotectors. Patients of the 2nd group received citicholine in dose 1000 mg per day. Patients of the 3rd group were treated with 250 ml actovegin per day. The NIH stroke scale, the modified Rankin scale and the Barthel index were used to assess neurological status dynamics. The significant decrease of neurological deficit and improvement of functional recovery were seen in patients treated both with citicholine and actovegin (p < 0.005) to the 30th day compared to the control group. There was a trend towards the decrease of brain infarction volume within 5 days after stroke in patients of the 4th group. No side-effects of citicholine and actovegin were found.
