A study was made of the level of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in patients with circulatory encephalopathy and brain infarction to find out the CIC level to be increased. The content of cholesterol in CIC was discovered to be also augmented, with that phenomenon being in agreement with the degree of atherosclerotic lesions to carotids. It has been shown that in patients with the increased content of cholesterol-containing CIC, the rise of platelet aggregation and blood coagulation is most remarkable.
