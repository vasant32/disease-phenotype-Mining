This case report shows the application of the upright motor control test in the physical therapy management of an individual following a stroke. The individual is a 43-year-old male who sustained an infarct of the right thalamus 2 days prior to inpatient rehabilitation admission. Observational gait analysis and the upright motor control test isolated the primary gait deficit as left hip and ankle extension in the stance phase of gait. Physical therapy interventions focused on specific functional tasks that challenged hip extension so that he could resume the activities in which he engaged prior to the stroke. After a 3 week length of stay in inpatient rehabilitation, the individual demonstrated an improvement in the outcome measures, functional progression with ambulation (level and stairs), and transfers sufficient to be discharged home. This case illustrates how standardized outcome measures assisted the clinician in isolating the gait impairments that limited his ability to ambulate within his home environment. Subsequently, the plan of care and physical therapy interventions focused on these deficits to maximize the functional outcomes.
