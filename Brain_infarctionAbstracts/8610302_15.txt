BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical trials of new drugs that reverse neurological deficits when used in the first hours of stroke onset suggest that early hospital admission is important. We analyzed a database of patients with acute stroke to determine the factors that delay hospital admission. METHODS: We analyzed all patients with their first stroke during 1993 in the province of Central Finland (population, 256 000). Patients referred to the Central Hospital, the only tertiary referral hospital in the area, were included in the study. RESULTS: Of the patients with first stroke, 363 (79%) were admitted to the Central Hospital. The stroke subtype was confirmed in 356 (98%) patients with CT scan, and the patient population included 272 (75%) with brain infarction, 51 (14%) with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 40 (11%) with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most important factor associated with a delay in reaching the hospital was the referral pattern. The median delay was 2 hours for patients brought directly to the Central Hospital, 8 hours if a physician at the local health center was consulted, and 47 hours if the patient was first admitted to the health center for observation. Other factors associated with a delay were ischemic stroke and stroke onset in the evening or night or during the weekend. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients who are candidates for acute stroke trials arrive at the hospital after prolonged delays for multiple reasons. Public and medical personnel education could result in signficant reduction in these delays.
