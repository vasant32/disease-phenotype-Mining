Bilateral paramedian thalamic infarcts are characterised initially by the association of acute vigilance disorders and vertical gaze palsy, followed by persisting dementia with severe mnemic disturbance, global aspontaneity and apathy. We describe a patient with a dramatic neuropsychological recovery, confirmed by testing examination and completed by a cerebral metabolism study. The pathophysiology of this type of cognitive deficit is discussed.
