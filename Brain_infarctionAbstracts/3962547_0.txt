The authors analyse the results of clinical and X-ray examination of 20 patients with stenosing lesions in the system of the internal carotid artery after operations for establishing extra-intracranial microvascular anastomoses (EICMA). Marked stable neurological symptomatology was encountered before the operation in arterial stenosis of a high degree (more than 50%) and the presence of brain infarctions. In functioning EICMA, evolution of stenoses in the system of the internal carotid arteries was found, which was characterized both by their increase (even to the development of thrombosis) and by their involution. Evolution of the stenoses did not occur if the EICMA failed to function. The operation leads to a less marked character of the neurological symptoms or has no particular effect on their dynamics. Changed amplitude and volume of active movements, muscular tone and strength, as well as of speech function, were found to be the most sensitive indicators of the operation efficacy. Regression of the neurologic symptoms after the operation was observed even in extensive brain infarctions and long standing of the disease.
