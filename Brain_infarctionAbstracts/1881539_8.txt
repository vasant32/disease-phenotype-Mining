The variations of the relative signal intensity and the time dependent changing contrast of intracranial hemorrhages on high-field spin-echo magnetic resonance images (MRI) were studied in 28 pediatric patients. For T1-weighted images, a repetition time (TR) of 500 ms and an echo time (TE) of 30 or 23 ms was used. The corresponding times for T2-weighted images were TR 3000 ms and TE 120 ms. Intracranial hematomas, less than 3 days old, were iso- to mildly hypointense on short TR/TE scans and markedly hypointense on long TR/TE scans (acute stage). In the following four days the signal of the hematomas became hyperintense on short TR/TE scans, beginning in the periphery and proceeding towards the center. On long TR/TE scans the signal remained markedly hypointense (early subacute stage). 7-14 days old hematomas were of high signal intensity on short TR/TE scans. On long TR/TE scans they appeared hypointense in the center and hyperintense in the periphery (late subacute stage). By the end of the second week the hematomas were of high signal intensity on all pulse sequences (chronic stage). Chronic hematomas were surrounded by a parenchymal rim of hypointensity on long TR/TE scans. 28 neonates and infants (with 11 follow-up examinations) of 31.5-70.6 weeks postconceptional age (PCA), with an intracranial hemorrhage were examined. The etiologies of the hemorrhages were: asphyxia (17 cases), brain infarct (2), thrombocytopenia (1), clotting disorder (1) and unknown origin (7). The aim of this study was to describe the appearance of intracranial hemorrhages in neonates and infants with MRI at 2.35 Tesla using spine-cho sequences.
