We report a case of deep cerebral venous thrombosis with bithalamic infarction that led to neuropsychological disorders including left side visuospatial neglect, aphasia and amnesia, as well as frontal and intellectual disorders. After a six month course, the patient showed only slight intellectual deficit and mild anterograde amnesia. Deep cerebral venous thrombosis is uncommon and prognosis is poor. Reports in the literature illustrate the neuropsychological disturbances they provoke but provide little analyzable data. The positive progress in our case demonstrates that bithalamic lesions of venous origin can have a good prognosis.
