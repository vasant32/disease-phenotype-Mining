Lacunar infarcts (LACs) and deep intracerebral hemorrhages (DICHs) occur in the same structures and may result from the same pathology. It is unclear why one patient has an LAC while another has DICH. We compared LAC to DICH cases derived from a population-based incidence study. In multivariate analysis, LAC cases were significantly older, more likely to have diabetes, and had higher cholesterol than DICH cases.
