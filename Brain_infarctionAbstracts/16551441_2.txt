 OBJECTIVES: Focal cerebral ischemia is responsible for alterations of vascular permeability, and the loss of microvascular integrity is a primary source of subsequent hemorrhages. We evaluated the influence of different durations of ischemia and reperfusion on infarction size and microvascular damage after focal cerebral ischemia in the mouse. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice (n=39) were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia (I) and reperfusion (R). Consecutive brain sections were analysed for infarction volumes (Nissl-staining) and for collagen type IV (immunohistochemistry and western blot). RESULTS: Infarction size (percentage of the infarction volume versus ipsilateral hemisphere) increased with total time of ischemia and reperfusion: 19+/-2% (I3R0), 30+/-2% (I3R3), 36+/-4% (I3R12), 41+/-4% (I1R24), 45+/-6% (I2R24) and 58+/-2% (I3R24). The ischemic hemispheres showed a significant progressive reduction of collagen type IV positive vessels (ischemic versus non-ischemic contralateral area): 90+/-3% (I3R0), 88+/-1% (I3R3), 82+/-3% (I3R12), 85+/-3% (I1R24), 79+/-3% (I2R24), 72+/-2% (I3R24). CONCLUSIONS: Both prolonged ischemia and reperfusion lead to an increased infarction volume, as well as progressive microvascular damage.
