The fatty acid composition of red blood cell membranes (which reflects dietary fat intake) was studied in 28 male patients with recent (less than 3 days) ischemic stroke and 56 matched controls. Fifteen fatty acids were measured by means of chromatographic analysis. Percentages of linoleic, 22:5, and 22:6 acids were significantly lower in red blood cell membranes of stroke patients than in those of matched controls. The results suggest that a low unsaturated fatty acid diet could be an independent risk factor for ischemic brain infarction.
