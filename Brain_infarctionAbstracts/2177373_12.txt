The clinical histories and pathological findings of 27 autopsied cases of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) were reviewed. Fatal OLT was complicated in 93% of cases by neurological dysfunction, usually manifested by encephalopathy, with or without seizures. The etiology of the encephalopathy was largely multifactorial (44%) or undetermined (20%). Subarachnoid hemorrhage, central pontine myelinolysis, meningitis, brain infarction, polyclonal B cell lymphoma and spinal cord necrosis were common neuropathological findings. These diagnoses were often masked by other systemic illnesses. The role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in neurologic dysfunction was explored with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. OLT cases showed a significantly higher (89%) frequency of CMV genomic material in brain tissue compared to age-matched non immunocompromised (NIC) patients (23%). All OLT cases with encephalopathy of undetermined cause demonstrated usually prominent hybridization to the CMV probe. CMV may be an important cause of encephalopathy in such patients.
