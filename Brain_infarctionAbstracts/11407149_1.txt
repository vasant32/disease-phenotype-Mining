Stroke-induced inflammatory reaction, which leads to invasion of leukocytes into the evolving brain infarct, seems to play a key role in the deterioration of brain ischaemic impairment. We have studied CSF and serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the potent proinflammatory cytokine, and peripheral white blood cells (WBC) counts in patients within the first 24 hours of ischaemic stroke. TNF-alpha levels in CSF and serum as well as WBC counts were increased. There was no correlation between TNF-alpha levels either in CSF and serum or in WBC counts. The results of our study suggest that increased CSF TNF-alpha levels may represent acute intracerebral inflammation in stroke, whereas elevated levels of TNF-alpha in serum may reflect the peripheral proinflammatory state as well as stroke-induced systemic inflammatory reaction. Increased CSF and serum TNF-alpha levels do not correlate with the elevation of WBC counts, suggesting that TNF-alpha overexpression observed in early phase of stroke is not dependent on increased total number of peripheral leukocytes.
