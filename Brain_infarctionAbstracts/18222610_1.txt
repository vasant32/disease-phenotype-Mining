The mouse model of transcranial permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tpMCAO) is widely used in stroke research. Here we quantified infarct size using a conventional histological method at several post-ischaemic times, going beyond the commonly analysed period of up to 2 days, following artery occlusion. Two different mouse strains, which are widely used for pharmacological studies of neuroprotection and for genetic engineering, were used. A drill whole was made into the skull of anaesthetised mice and ischaemia was induced by electrocoagulation of the middle cerebral artery. In both mouse strains tested (C57Black/6 and NMRI), the measured infarct volumes decreased significantly during the first days after tpMCAO. Notably, 13 days after surgery, ischaemic and sham-operated animals had indistinguishably small lesions, which where in the range of only 5% of the infarct size on day 2 post-ischaemia. The standard method of calculating oedema and shrinkage correction provided no sufficient explanation for this significant decrease in infarct volume. There was, however, evidence that structural changes in the residual ipsilateral hemisphere may compromise the significance of results arising from the method of calculating oedema and shrinkage correction. In conclusion, our study indicates that the pronounced and fast, time-dependent decrease in histologically defined infarct volume can compromise results when studying the lasting neuroprotective effects of potential drugs.
