 OBJECTIVE: High levels of serum cholesterol are associated with the risk of stroke. However, the association of serum cholesterol with silent brain infarcts (SBIs) is unclear. We investigated the association between SBI and various clinical factors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included 324 apparently healthy Japanese men (mean age 53.8+/-9.2 years). Combinations of three types of scan (T1-weighted, T2-weighted and FLAIR images) were used to detect and discriminate SBI. RESULTS: Serum cholesterol was significantly associated with SBI [total cholesterol, odds ratio (OR) 3.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45-9.68); LDL-cholesterol, OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.03-6.27), and non-HDL-cholesterol, OR 2.54 (95% CI 1.03-6.27)] after adjustment for age, smoking status, serum triglycerides, maximal-intima-media thickness, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, coronary heart disease and lipid-lowering agent use. CONCLUSION: Our cross-sectional data suggest that serum cholesterol levels are associated with SBI independently of known confounders.
