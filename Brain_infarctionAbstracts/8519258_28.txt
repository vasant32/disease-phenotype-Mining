The previously reported method for quantitative measurements of whole-brain or hemispheric-brain perfusion using technetium-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) radionuclide angiography is now further developed so that regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) can be measured. Lassen's correction algorithm is used for the linearization of a curve-linear relationship between the radioactivity in the brain and blood flow as seen with single-photon emission tomography (SPET) images. In this algorithm, the cerebral hemisphere was chosen as the reference region and the correction factor alpha was adapted to rCBF in the reference region. This new method of measuring CBF from SPET has been validated in 33 normal subjects and 22 patients with cerebrovascular disease. Regional CBF values in 20 brain regions of the normal subjects were in good agreement with reported values measured by other methods. Regional CBF in the frontal cortex was greater than that in the temporal, parietal or occipital cortex for the entire age range. This hyperfrontal perfusion tended to be less pronounced with advancing age. Seventeen patients with unilateral brain infarction showed significantly lower rCBF than normal subjects. The infarct core showed a low rCBF value of 11.1 ml/100 g/min on average. An increase in rCBF after acetazolamide administration was observed and measured with this method in five patients with unilateral occlusive vascular pathology. These results suggest that this non-invasive method (without any blood sampling) permits the routine measurement of rCBF from HMPAO SPET tomograms of blood flow.
