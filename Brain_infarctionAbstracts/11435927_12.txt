Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including ischemia. Occlusion of common carotid artery and middle cerebral artery has been used to produce focal ischemic lesions in the rat. Here, we examined the associations between immune reactions and postischemic brain infarction. Ischemia/reperfusion time-dependently caused brain infarction. The kinetics of inflammatory reactions in rat brain including inflammatory cell infiltration, edema formation, cytokines/chemokines and adhesion molecules production and matrix metalloproteinase activation were relevant to the progression of ischemic infarction. Differential induction profile after ischemia suggests that this activation might contribute to secondary brain damage in ischemic tissues. On the other hand, another possibility of this response is to trigger processes that mediate the neural regeneration after ischemic injury.
