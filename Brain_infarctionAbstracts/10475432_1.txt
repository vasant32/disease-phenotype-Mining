Thrombosis in the right ventricle occurred early after bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt in 2 patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and major right ventricular coronary artery communication, and perioperative brain infarction occurred in 1 patient. Clinicians should be aware of the hazards of this potentially lethal complication, and transfusion of platelets and fresh plasma should be minimized. Although the hemodynamic state is good, echocardiography should be performed frequently and strict anticoagulation should be started as early as possible.
