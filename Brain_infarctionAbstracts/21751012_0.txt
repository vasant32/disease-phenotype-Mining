 BACKGROUND: Atherothrombotic ischemia is the most frequent cause of cerebral ischemia; however, few reports have addressed the prognostic factors predicting early neurological deterioration (END) when the occlusive lesion is limited to the anterior main trunk, middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal cerebral artery (ICA). METHOD: Between 2006 and 2008, 122 atherothrombotic ischemia patients were diagnosed with MCA or ICA occlusive disease on magnetic resonance angiography. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and the modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score on diffusion-weighted imaging [ASPECTS-DW (modified)] were calculated. Clinical-DWI mismatch (CDM) was evaluated using NIHSS and the ASPECTS-DW (modified) to examine the predictive efficacy for early neurological deterioration. RESULTS: Eighteen of 122 (14.8%) patients fulfilled the definition of CDM. END was observed in 24 patients (19.7%) within 15 days after admission. CDM was observed in 14 cases in the END (+) group (14 of 24 cases, 58.3%) and 4 cases in the END (-) group (4 of 98 cases, 4.1%) (p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CDM was a significant predictive factor of END (odds ratio 26.68, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CDM based on NIHSS and ASPECTS-DW (modified) could be a significant predictive factor for END of atherothrombotic ischemia in MCA/ICA.
