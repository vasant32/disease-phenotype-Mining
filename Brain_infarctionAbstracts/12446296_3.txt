 PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 68-year-old man who suffered ischemic strokes in the left middle cerebral artery territory and three months later, following urosepsis, developed a cerebral abscess in the infarcted area. DISCUSSION: A literature search found only eight other cases. We discuss herein the common clinical aspects of brain abscess complicating strokes, the co-existent diseases, and point out the possibility of underreporting this rare but treatable complication. CONCLUSION: Cerebral abscess should be suspected in patients with a previous brain infarction or haemorrhage, who develop bacteremia and impaired consciousness without a clear explanation to their condition. Advanced age, and medical conditions known adversely to affect immunological competence reinforce the clinical suspicion.
