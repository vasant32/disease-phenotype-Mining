We investigated the relationship between serum triglyceride level and acute ischemic stroke severity using infarct volume on CT brain scans as a marker. A total of 121 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients (53 males and 68 females, age 47-93 years) with anterior circulation (75%), posterior circulation (9%) or lacunar infarcts (16%) were examined. All patients were admitted within 24 h of the symptom onset, and CT scans were taken over the subsequent 24-72 h. With adjustment for the infarct type, age, sex, timing of CT imaging (24-36, >36-48 or >48-72 h since admission), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, fasting cholesterol and glucose levels, a higher (> or =1.70 mmol/l) fasting serum triglyceride level (within 24 h after admission) was associated with a lower infarct volume (p = 0.014). In line with a recent report on milder clinical symptoms in acute ischemic stroke patients with higher triglycerides, the results suggest an independent association between serum triglyceride level and stroke severity.
