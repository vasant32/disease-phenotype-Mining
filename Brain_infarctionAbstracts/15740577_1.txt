OBJECTIVES: To compare the characteristics of lacunar stroke (LS) in patients with and without intermittent claudication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 484 consecutive patients with LS were collected from a prospective hospital-based stroke registry in which 2500 patients are included. RESULTS: Of the 142 patients with ischemic stroke and intermittent claudication, 39 (27.5%) had LS (8% of all lacunes). In the multivariate analysis, small centrum ovale topography (odds ratio 7.35), carotid stenosis >50% (odds ratio 3.17), and absence of limitation at discharge (odds ratio 2.01) were independent variables significantly associated with LS in patients with intermittent claudication. CONCLUSION: Only 8% of patients with LS had intermittent claudication. The short-term prognosis is good with a spontaneous early neurological recovery at discharge in 51.3% of patients. LS patients with intermittent claudication showed a striking similarity in risk factors and clinical syndromes in comparison with the LS patients without intermittent claudication.
