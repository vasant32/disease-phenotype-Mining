A high cure rate of ovarian germ cell tumors was achieved by establishment of a cisplatin-containing regimen. We encountered a rare case of a 33-year-old, nulligravida Japanese woman with systemic thromboembolism following anti-cancer chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin in ovarian germ cell tumor. She suffered from brain infarction, multiple embolisms in the bilateral pulmonary artery and pelvic vein, and a broad range of deep vein thromboses in the right extremities vein. When thrombosis is detected during anti-cancer chemotherapy, we must investigate whether the presence of thrombosis is systemic or local.
