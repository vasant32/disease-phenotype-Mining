 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs) contribute to poor outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Endothelin-1 is an important mediator involved in the development of vasospasm. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the use of endothelin-receptor antagonists (ETRAs) in patients with SAH. RESULTS: Three studies met eligibility criteria, enrolling 867 patients. ETRAs significantly reduced the occurrence of DINDs (OR 0.68 [0.49 to 0.95]) and radiographic vasospasm (OR 0.31 [0.19 to 0.49]), but did not have any impact on mortality (OR 1.09 [0.69 to 1.72]) or poor neurological outcomes (OR 0.87 [0.63 to 1.20]). Any benefit of ETRAs may have been partially offset by adverse effects, including hypotension(OR 2.39 [1.37 to 4.17]) and pulmonary complications (OR 2.12 [1.51 to 2.98]). CONCLUSIONS: Although ETRAs reduce radiographic vasospasm and DINDs, there is currently no evidence that they improve outcomes.
