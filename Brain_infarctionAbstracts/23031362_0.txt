We conducted a study to evaluate arterial stiffness markers in subjects with acute ischemic stroke and metabolic syndrome and in relation to TOAST subtype of stroke. We enrolled 130 patients with acute ischemic stroke and metabolic syndrome, 127 patients with acute ischemic stroke without metabolic syndrome and 120 control subjects without acute stroke. Applanation tonometry to record pulse wave velocity (PWV). Stroke patients with metabolic syndrome, compared control subjects without stroke showed higher PWV. In subjects with ischemic stroke and metabolic syndrome, PWV was more significantly and positively correlated with body mass index, systolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, glucose blood levels, LDL cholesterol levels, total cholesterol levels, micro-albuminuria, carotid plaque, previous brain infarct at neuro-imaging. Our findings underline important role of both small vessel disease and atherosclerosis on arterial stiffness pathogenesis in the clinical setting of metabolic syndrome.
