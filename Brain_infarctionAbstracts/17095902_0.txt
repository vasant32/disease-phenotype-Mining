Blepharospasm, psychotic symptoms, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms can result from brain infarction. However, a presentation of these 3 symptoms simultaneously is rare. This report describes a 65-year-old woman who had old brain infarction and presented with these 3 symptoms for 2 years. The patient recovered after receiving a regimen of clozapine 125 mg/d for 3 months. No recurrences of symptoms were noted during a 6-month follow-up. This is the first case report demonstrating that clozapine is effective for a patient with blepharospasm, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and psychotic symptoms presenting simultaneously. This report also reminds physicians of the possible organic causes of unusual presentations in elderly patients.
