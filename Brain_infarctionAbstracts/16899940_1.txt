The aim of this work was to perform a comparative investigation of erythrocyte aggregability changes in the peripheral and cerebral circulation during ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Subjects of the present study were patients with ischemic brain infarcts (14 patients) and with hemorrhagic stroke (21 patients) from the Intensive Care Unit of the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery. The blood samples were obtained from the following blood vessels: the common carotid artery carrying blood to the primarily damaged brain hemisphere, both jugular veins carrying blood from the primarily damaged and the contralateral hemispheres, as well as from the cubital vein to obtain specimens of the systemically circulating blood. Erythrocyte aggregation was evaluated by using the "Georgian technique". We found that the RBC aggregation indices increased in both the regional as well as the systemic circulation of the hemorrhagic stroke patients as compared to ischemic stroke patients. The results of the present study demonstrate different changes of erythrocyte aggregation in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients. Therefore, the role of blood rheological properties in their pathogenesis seems also to be different.
