OBJECTIVE: Echolucency of carotid atherosclerotic plaques, as evaluated by computerized B-mode ultrasonographic images, has been associated with an increased incidence of brain infarcts on cerebral computed tomographic scans. We tested the hypotheses that characterization of carotid plaques on spiral computed tomographic images correlates with that on computerized B-mode ultrasonographic images and that spiral computed tomographic imaging predicts the histomorphometric plaque content. METHODS: The study included 38 patients with neurologic symptoms and at least 50% stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery. High-resolution B-mode ultrasonographic images and spiral computed tomographic images of carotid plaques were computer processed to yield a quantitative measure, the gray scale level of the plaque. RESULTS: The mean Hounsfield value for spiral computed tomographic images correlated with the gray scale median for B-mode ultrasonographic images (univariate linear regression analysis: r = 0.45; P = .01) and the histologic content of calcification in the plaque (r = 0.34; P = .04) but not with lipid, hemorrhage, or fibrous tissue in the plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Spiral computed tomographic imaging seems to correlate with B-mode ultrasonographic imaging for showing plaque characteristics. Spiral computed tomographic attenuation was also correlated with the amount of calcification noted on histologic examination but not with lipid and hemorrhage, the components thought to characterize vulnerable, rupture-prone plaques.
