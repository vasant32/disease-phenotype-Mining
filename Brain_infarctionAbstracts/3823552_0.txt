A series of EEG recordings shows the evolution of a periodic activity (PA) in a 57-year-old man with acute cerebral infarction. The complexes ranged from 100 to 150 microV, the duration was 750 msec; the periodic occurrence repeated itself every 2 sec. PA is obliterated during the onset of electroclinical seizures. The CT scan shows temporal brain infarction.
