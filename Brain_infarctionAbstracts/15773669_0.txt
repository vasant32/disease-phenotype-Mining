The authors report the case of a 39-year-old male patient who had an ischemic stroke (complete infarction of right anterior cerebral circulation) and an acute myocardial infarction during the same year. Molecular study revealed he was homozygous for the 677C-->T mutation in the gene coding for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, a key enzyme of folate metabolism; deficiency of this enzyme is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and neurological lesions. Some considerations are put forward about hyperhomocysteinemia and the MTHFR 677C-->T mutation as cardiovascular risk factors.
