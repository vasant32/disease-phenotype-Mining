Hemoglobin vesicle (HbV), which is also called liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin, functions as a hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier and is expected to be utilized in emergency situations including hemorrhagic shock and several kinds of ischemic diseases. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of HbV for improving stroke-related symptoms induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion/reperfusion and an intra-internal carotid arterial injection of arachidonic acid (AA) in rats. When HbV (10 mL/kg, i.v.) was administered to rats immediately after the MCA occlusion, it reduced the cerebral infarct volumes of the cortex and total of the cortex plus sub-cortex significantly as compared with saline as a vehicle. In AA-induced stroke model, HbV (10 mL/kg, i.v.) improved the motor dysfunction score and inhibited the increase in cerebral water content suggesting it could suppress cerebral edema. These results strongly suggest that HbV would provide a novel beneficial option for the treatment of stroke, especially acute ischemic stroke.
