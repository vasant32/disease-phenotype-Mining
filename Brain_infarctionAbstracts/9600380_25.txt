Severe transient focal cerebral ischemia causes brain infarction with a strong glial reaction. We have studied whether postischemic reactive glial cells express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) following middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. We have also looked for signs of proliferating activity, as EGFR is known to be involved in cell growth and proliferation in certain non-neural cells. EGFR was studied using three different antibodies which were found to stain for a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (p170) corresponding to the membrane-anchored EGFR. Neurons of the control brain were strongly immunoreactive to EGFR, but a decrease of EGFR-immunoreactivity was seen in the ipsilateral brain side from 24 h postischemia due to neuronal loss. However, the presence of abundant glial cells strongly immunoreactive to EGFR became apparent in this area from 4 days postischemia onward. The use of microglial (lectin or OX-42) and astroglial (GFAP) markers showed that these postischemic EGFR-stained cells were reactive microglia/macrophages and astroglia. The subcellular localization of EGFR in reactive microglia/macrophages was compatible with the network of the Golgi apparatus, as revealed with an antibody against a peripheral membrane-bound protein of the Golgi. The presence of abundant proliferating cells in the ischemic brain was detected from 4 days postischemia with an antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Proliferating reactive microglia/macrophages were abundant within the infarcted brain side, whereas proliferating astrocytes were found mainly in the immediate periphery of the infarct limiting the necrotic area from the undamaged tissue. These proliferating cells were immunoreactive to EGFR. The results show the presence of EGFR in postischemic reactive glial cells and suggest that EGFR-dependent pathways mediate signal transduction in reactive glia following transient focal cerebral ischemia.
