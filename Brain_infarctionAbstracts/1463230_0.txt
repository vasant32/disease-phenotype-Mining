Clinical signs of non-traumatic apallic syndrome (AS) are caused by universal necrosis of the brain cortex, with the brain stem remaining intact. The reasons of AS are heart and respiration arrest, stable collapses of various genesis, vascular brain diseases. Management was ineffective. Strict AS prevention is necessary, i.e. timely and expert cardiorespiratory resuscitation. Intensive care and cardiorespiratory resuscitation are not recommended in patients with vast brain infarction secondary to brain vascular diseases.
