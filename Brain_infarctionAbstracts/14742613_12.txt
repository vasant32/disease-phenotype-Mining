We report two cases of multiple distal borderzone ischaemic strokes associated with hypereosinophilia due to idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome in one patient and to acute Schistosoma mansoni infestation in the other. Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) was documented pathologically, in one case at autopsy and in the other after cardiac surgery; and by cardiac CT, with initially negative echocardiography, in one patient. These observations suggest that so called borderzone infarcts may be due to microembolisms and that, in the context of hypereosinophilia, EMF diagnosis warrants complete cardiac investigation including cardiac CT and repeat echocardiography.
