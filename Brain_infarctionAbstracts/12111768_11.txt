Overt stroke is rare among sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in Kuwait. However, there are no previous studies of silent cerebral infarcts, which have been described in up to 20% of American children with Hb SS. We have carried out a prospective brain MRI study among otherwise normal SCD patients, who were consecutive patients seen in a 1-year period to document the prevalence of silent cerebral infarcts in children with sickle cell disease in Kuwait. Any patient with a previous seizure or other neurological abnormality was excluded. MRI was done with a 1.5 Tesla unit with super-conducting magnet. T1- and T2-weighted sagittal and axial sections and proton density axial images were obtained in 5-mm thick sections. The study group consisted of 30 (23 SS and 7 Sbeta(0)Thal) patients-19 males and 11 females-whose ages ranged from 6 to 17 (mean of 9.8 +/- 3.5) years. Hb F ranged from 11% to 35% with a mean of 22.8% +/- 5.7%. Only one patient, a 10-and-a-half-year-old boy with Hb SS, showed hyperintense signals in the parietal white matter, consistent with small infarcts, thus giving a prevalence of 3.3%. Silent brain infarcts are uncommon in our patients, and the protective factors remain to be fully elucidated.
