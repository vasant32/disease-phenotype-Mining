Two patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) had a malignant course despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. A 63-year-old woman presented with symptoms of headache, jaw claudication, scalp paresthesia, and visual disturbances. A temporal artery biopsy showed GCA. While on prednisone, she suffered ischemic strokes, and serial cerebral angiograms demonstrated bilateral, severe and progressive narrowing of distal vertebral and internal carotid arteries. Despite escalating immunosuppressive therapies, she suffered more infarcts and eventually died. Postmortem examination of arteries showed no active inflammation. A 65-year-old man presented with extrapyramidal symptoms though no symptoms typical of GCA. Imaging showed multiple ischemic strokes. Because serial angiograms demonstrated findings similar to the first patient, he underwent temporal artery biopsy that showed GCA. He died 7 months after his presentation with complications of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. These two patients confirm that GCA can follow a lethal course despite escalating immunosuppressive therapies. Our two patients were unique in that eventually both anterior and posterior circulations were involved bilaterally in a characteristic location where the arteries penetrate the dura. This pattern should always raise the possibility of GCA and, if confirmed, should prompt aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. The dismal outcomes despite this approach may suggest a non-inflammatory arteriopathy, as seen on necropsy in one of our patients. Such an arteriopathy may require novel therapies to be considered for this severe variant of GCA.
