Eighty patients were studied at the first day of the development of lacunar stroke, the main attention being focused on the particular form of focal pathology--a small deep (lacunar) stroke (SDS). Patients with arterial hypertension and complication free course had higher hemorheologic parameters (blood viscosity, erythrocytes aggregation) and a shift of prostacyclin-thromboxane balance towards preaggregation and decrease of fibrinolysis. These disturbances strengthened during the development of SDS. The endothelium dysfunction, alterations of blood rheologic characteristics due to the formation of aggregants of erythrocytes, decrease of erythrocytes deformation and activation of cell homeostasis play a central role in the development of intracranial arterial occlusion resulted in the SDS development. At the same time, fibrinolysis remains relatively stable.
