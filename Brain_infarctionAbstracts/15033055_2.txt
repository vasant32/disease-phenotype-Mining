 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical features, etiology and prognosis in ataxic hemiparesis syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive study of 23 patients with ataxic hemiparesis included in the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona Stroke Registry over a 12 year period. RESULTS: Ataxic hemiparesis was caused by a lacunar infarct in 87% of patients, by atherothrombotic infarcts in 8.7% and by cardioembolic infarct in 4.3%. Ataxic hemiparesis accounted for 0.9% of all acute strokes (n = 2,500), 1.25% of all cerebral infarcts (n = 1,840), and 4.1% of all lacunar infarcts (n = 484). Internal capsule (22%), pons (13%), and corona radiata involvement (9%) were the most frequent cerebral topographies. Absence of in hospital mortality and absence of neurological deficit at discharge from the hospital were present in 39% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lacune hypothesis is present in ataxic hemiparesis syndrome. Ataxic hemiparesis is caused by a lacunar infarct in 87% of patients. The internal capsule topography is the most frequent and the prognosis in ataxic hemiparesis is good.
