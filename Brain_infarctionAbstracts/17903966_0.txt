 BACKGROUND: Data on subtype and location of recurrent stroke after a first cerebral infarct may be relevant for prognosis and for understanding progression of the vascular disease underlying stroke subtypes over time. Therefore, we studied 30-day case fatality, stroke subtype, and stroke location in first and recurrent stroke, accounting for stroke subtype. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional follow-up of 998 patients with first cerebral infarct registered in a hospital-based stroke registry. RESULTS: After a follow-up of 691 +/- 521 (SD) days, there were 138 (13.8%) first recurrent strokes, 84 (61%) of which had computed tomography. Recurrent stroke was of the same subtype as the first stroke in 27 (57%) of 339 lacunar, 38 (83%) of 435 atherothrombotic, and 33 (94%) of 224 cardioembolic cerebral infarcts. The annual stroke recurrence rate was about 7% for the whole group. Logistic regression analysis showed lacunar first stroke and hypertension as independent predictors for recurrent lacunar stroke, and atherothrombotic first stroke type for recurrent atherothrombotic stroke. Stroke recurrences that were of the same type as the first stroke occurred in the same brain area as the first stroke in 70% of lacunar and 79% of atherothrombotic cases. This was more frequent when compared with nonsimilar recurrence types: odds ratio (OR) 4.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-15.79; and OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.38-22.92, respectively. Only 33% of cardioembolic recurrent strokes occurred in the same area. The 30-day case fatality in index and recurrent stroke was, respectively, 2% and 14% (OR 7.90, 95% CI 2.78-22.48) for lacunar, 10% and 26% (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.62-6.60) for atherothrombotic, and 23% and 31% (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.55-3.93) for cardioembolic index infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: The annual stroke recurrence rate after a first brain infarcts is about 7%. Early case fatality after recurrent stroke is higher than after first stroke, with marked differences between stroke subtypes. Progression of small and large vessel disease, and the brain area of their location, are rather homogeneous over time.
