Neonatal cerebral ischemic injury is a common and debilitating pathology for which there is currently no known purely pharmacological treatments that are effective when delivered immediately after injury. Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides that can remove cholesterol from cell membranes and thereby affect receptor function. Cyclodextrins have previously been shown to be neuroprotective in vitro. We showed that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is neuroprotective in rats in vivo when delivered by intraperitoneal injection 30 min following hypoxia-ischemia, when assessed 15 days after surgery. A single dose of 1 g/kg hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced brain infarction size by 28.57% compared with control (P<0.001). We also report that the same compound reduces neuronal excitability in hippocampal slices and propose that hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is neuroprotective by reducing excitotoxicity in the delayed phase of brain damage.
