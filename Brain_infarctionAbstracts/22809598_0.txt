 OBJECTIVE: To study the image characteristics of neonatal purulent meningitis caused by different pathogenic bacteria, using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The clinical data of 58 hospitalized newborns with purulent meningitis receiving MRI examination from January 2005 to February 2012 were retrospectively studied. Pathogens and MRI findings were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 58 newborns, 44 (76%) showed complications of the neural system on the first MRI. Escherichia coli were found as the most common pathogen in newborns with Gram-negative bacteria-induced purulent meningitis (six cases). Of the six cases, four presented with ventriculitis, one with subdural effusion and one with brain infarction on MRI. Listeria monocytogenes was frequently seen in newborns with Gram-positive bacteria-induced purulent meningitis (three cases). All three cases presented with different degrees of white matter damage on MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal purulent meningitis caused by different pathogenic bacteria has different image characteristics. This suggests that understanding the patterns of MRI findings is useful in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of neonatal purulent meningitis caused by different pathogens.
