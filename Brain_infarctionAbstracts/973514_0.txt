The degree of effectiveness of preventive therapy with anticoagulants, following brain infarctions and in the stage of transient disorderd brain ciruclation, was studied in comparison with the frequency of repeated ischemic disorders in 166 patients, and in a control group of 138 normals. During permanent administration of anticoagulants repeated ischemic episodes appeared less frequently than with other forms of medication. However, there was an increased amount of ischemic disorders after a discontinuation of the preparations. The most expressed signs of such conditions were in patients with repeated brain infarctions in a low arterial pressure and especially in the stage of transient disorders of brain circulation. In such cases the indications for the use of anticoagulants should be very limited.
