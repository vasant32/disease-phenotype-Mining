The occurence of mutism after thalamic lesions has rarely been observed before adulthood. We report a 6.5-year-old girl who presented with sudden mutism with a decreased level of alertness. Her MRI revealed a T2-fluid attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in both thalami, which suggested bithalamic infarction in the territory of the thalamo-perforating arteries and, more specifically, the para-median territories. Mutism was followed by a deficit of speech initiation with slow and slurred speech. Her speech returned to normal at 3 months after the onset of symptoms. Thus mutism could be the equivalent of akinetic mutism limited to the speech sphere.
