BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial. We did a bedside-to-bench study in standardized rat stroke models to explore mechanisms for these untoward results. METHODS: After focal brain ischemia in Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we administered murine anti-rat ICAM-1 antibody (1A29), subclass-matched murine immunoglobulin (IgG1), or vehicle intravenously. To examine whether rat anti-mouse antibodies were generated against the mouse protein and whether these were deleterious, we sensitized Wistar rats with 1A29 or vehicle 7 days before surgery. Infarct volume, tissue myeloperoxidase activity, neutrophil CD11b expression, and microvascular E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1 expression were examined 48 hours after surgery. Complement activation was serially assessed for 2 hours after a single injection of either 1A29 or vehicle. RESULTS: 1A29 treatment did not significantly reduce infarct size in either strain. 1A29 sensitization augmented infarct size and generated rat anti-mouse antibodies. Although 1A29 inhibited neutrophil trafficking shown by reduction in brain myeloperoxidase activity, circulating neutrophils were activated and displayed CD11b upregulation. Complement was activated in 1A29-sensitized Wistar rats and 1A29-treated SHR. E-selectin (SHR), endothelial P-selectin (Wistar and SHR), and ICAM-1 (SHR) were upregulated in animals treated with 1A29. CONCLUSIONS: Administration to rats of a murine antibody preparation against ICAM-1, 1A29, elicits the production of host antibodies against the protein, activation of circulating neutrophils, complement activation, and sustained microvascular activation. These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke.
