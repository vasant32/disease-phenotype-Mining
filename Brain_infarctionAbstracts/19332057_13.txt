To determine whether intranasal administration (iN) of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) provides neuroprotection to the neonatal rat brain following cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI), two doses of rhIGF-1 (50 microg at a 1 h interval) were infused into the right naris of postnatal day 7 (P7) rat pups with or without a prior HI insult (right common carotid artery ligation, followed by an exposure to 8% oxygen for 2 h). Our result showed that rhIGF-1 administered via iN was successfully delivered into the brain 30 min after the second dose. In the following studies rhIGF-1 was administered to P7 rat pups at 0, 1 or 2 h after HI at the dose described above. Pups in the control group received cerebral HI and vehicle treatment. Pups that underwent sham operation and vehicle treatment served as the sham group. Brain pathological changes were evaluated 2 and 15 days after HI. Our results showed that rhIGF-1 treatment up to 1 h after cerebral HI effectively reduced brain injury as compared to that in the vehicle-treated rats. Moreover, rhIGF-1 treatment improved neurobehavioral performance (tested on P5-P21) in juvenile rats subjected to HI. Our results further showed that rhIGF-1 inhibited apoptotic cell death, possibly through activating the Akt signal transduction pathway. rhIGF-1 enhanced proliferation of neuronal and oligodendroglial progenitors after cerebral HI as well. These data suggest that iN administration of IGF-1 has the potential to be used for clinical treatment.
