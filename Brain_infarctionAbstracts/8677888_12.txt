The relation between obesity and new ABI is also unclear. The Framingham Study found that relative weight was not a risk factor for new ABI in older men but was a weak risk factor for new ABI in older women. Barrett-Connor and Khaw found no association between body mass index and new ABI in older men or women. The present study showed that obesity was not a risk factor for new ABI in older men. Obesity was a risk factor for new ABI in older women by univariate analysis but not by multivariate analysis. However, because obesity is associated with other risk factors for ABI and new coronary events, we would try to lower weight in obese older men and women.
