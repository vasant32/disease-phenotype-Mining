 OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess paraoxonase (PON1) and arylesterase (ARE) activities and polymorphism in patients with lacunar infarctions. DESIGN AND METHODS: The PON1 activity, ARE and lipid profile were determined in 37 patients and 53 healthy individuals. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients (20 males and 17 females) were studied. The levels of PON1 activity in patients and healthy individuals were 63.5±46.7IU/L and 95.5±75.5IU/L, respectively (p=0.024). The same values for ARE were 54.3±19.3KU/L for patients and 69.1±29.3KU/L for controls (p=0.008). Polymorphism in Q192R location shows statistically different presentation in patient group compared to healthy controls with an odds ratio of 3.42 (CI 95%: 1.24-9.44, p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, we suggest that PON1 192R polymorphism may play a minor role as a risk marker for developing lacunar infarctions in a group of Iranian population.
