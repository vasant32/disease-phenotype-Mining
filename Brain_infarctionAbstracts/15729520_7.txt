 OBJECTIVE: We report a clinical description of pure sensory stroke based on data collected from a prospective acute stroke registry. METHODS: From 2500 acute stroke patients included in a hospital-based prospective stroke registry over a 12-year period, 99 were identified as having pure sensory stroke. RESULTS: Pure sensory stroke accounted for 4.7% of all acute stroke patients, 5.4% of acute ischemic stroke, and 17.4% of lacunar syndromes. Complete hemisensory syndrome was present in 80 patients and incomplete hemisensory syndrome in 19 (cheiro-oral syndrome 12, cheiro-oral-pedal 6, isolated oral syndrome 1). The lacunar hypothesis was fulfilled in 88% of patients. Atherothrombotic infarction occurred in 8 patients, intracerebral hemorrhage in 3, and stroke of undetermined cause in 1. Hemorrhagic pure sensory stroke was diagnosed in 1% of all cases of hemorrhagic stroke (n = 270) in the database. Outcome was good (in-hospital mortality 0%, symptom-free at discharge 41.5%). After multivariate analysis, absence of disability at discharge, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and thalamic (56.5%) and corona radiata (4%) locations were clinical and topographic variables significantly associated with pure sensory stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Pure sensory stroke is an infrequent cerebrovascular syndrome, in which the lacunar hypothesis is supported. Most patients had thalamic lacunar infarction. Incomplete hemisensory syndromes were also caused by a lacunar infarct in 84% of patients. Hemorrhagic pure sensory stroke accounted only for 3% of the cases. The prognosis is good with striking similarity to other lacunar strokes. There are important differences between pure sensory stroke and nonlacunar strokes.
