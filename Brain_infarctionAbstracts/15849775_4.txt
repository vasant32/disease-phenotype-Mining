Strong associations have been established between various HLA alleles and different complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). Recently, the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was shown to be associated with susceptibility to stroke while the HLA-DRB1*02 allele may be protective. While stroke and silent brain infarcts (SBI) are unusual in Kuwaiti children with SCD, avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH) is quite common. The modulatory association factors must still be elucidated. An investigation of HLA-DRB1 alleles was carried out in a group of 68 Kuwaiti SS patients, of age 7-44 years, of whom 20 (29.4%) had AVNFH, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. A group of 167 apparently healthy age- and sex-matched individuals served as controls. Comparison of the HLA alleles between the whole SS group and the controls showed a significant over-representation of DRB1*01 (P < 0.01) and DRB1*10 (P < 0.05) in the patient group. No significant differences in the allele frequencies in the SS patients with or without AVNFH were observed. It therefore appears that the HLA-DRB1 locus does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AVNFH Kuwaiti patients.
