Tuberothalamic artery infarction (TTAI) results mainly in a myriad of neuropsychological symptoms such as memory impairment, euphoria, apathy, verbal perseverations, constructional apraxia and lack of spontaneity. Language disturbances, acalculia, buccofacial and limb apraxia occur prominently after left TTAI while visual spatial processing deficits and hemispatial neglect occur prominently after the right one. Some cases of TTAI causing Horner's syndrome in addition of these wide-ranging neurobehavioral symptoms have been reported. Here, we report a case of TTAI with an ipsilateral ptosis as main clinical manifestation. This finding suggests that a Horner's syndrome can be the main feature of TTAI when neuropsychological manifestations are inconspicuous.
