 OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the functional Notch3 polymorphism T6746C, which is not causative for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), might be a risk factor for migraine. BACKGROUND: It has been recently demonstrated that migraine is characterized by subclinical brain infarctions and white matter lesions. Several genetic risk factors have been associated with migraine, but no study has unraveled a possible relationship between migraine and Notch3, which is involved in vascular damage. Mutations in Notch3 gene have been demonstrated to be pathogenetic for CADASIL, a small vessel disease of the brain characterized by migraine. METHODS: A total of 156 migraine patients and 128 nonheadache healthy volunteers entered the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were carefully recorded, and a neurological work-up was performed. Moreover, each subject underwent a blood sampling for Notch3 genotype determination. RESULTS: Notch3 genotypes as well as allele frequencies did not differ in migraine patients compared to controls, even adjusting for the presence of possible confounds. No difference has been found either in migraine patients with aura or in those without aura. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the view that functional polymorphism T6746C in Notch3 gene is not involved in increasing the risk of migraine or migraine subtypes.
