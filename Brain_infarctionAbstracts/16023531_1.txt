Lactate is an important metabolite in clinical cases indicating the status of metabolic impairment. We applied a clinically relevant simple method for lactate quantification using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We used two long in-phase echo time (TE=272,544 ms) to calculate T2 relaxation time and the absolute concentration of lactate. This method was optimized using phantom study and applied to clinical cases. This technique does not require complicated processing and could be applied in daily clinical practice. Moreover, this technique enables lactate quantification in cases (e.g. tumor) where lipid peak is overlapped with the lactate peak at short echo times.
