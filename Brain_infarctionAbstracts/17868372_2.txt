Previous studies have suggested that increased norepinephrine plays an important role in recovery of function after brain injury; however, the majority of these studies used drugs that are known to also affect other monoamines to increase or decrease norepinephrine. The purpose of the present study was to determine if norepinephrine is required to promote recovery after ischemia. A form of enriched rehabilitation was used to rehabilitate animals after ischemia and the neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine was used to selectively destroy norepinephrine projections from the locus coeruleus. Three sensorimotor tests were used to evaluate the recovery of the animals. Depletion of norepinephrine improved sensorimotor recovery in standard-housed animals and did not impede recovery in the rehabilitation groups. Dopamine beta hydroxylase staining was used to confirm N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine-depleted terminal norepinephrine levels. The amount of norepinephrine terminal staining negatively correlated with recovery of function in the staircase test after ischemia. In addition, enriched rehabilitation increased, but depletion of norepinephrine had no effect on, brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels, which have also been linked to improved recovery of function. Together the above findings question the previously postulated role of norepinephrine in recovery of function after stroke.
