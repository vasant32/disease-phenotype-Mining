Although ample research has been done into cognitive disorders occurring after stroke, relatively few data are available on the development and the course of vascularmild cognitive impairment (VMCI) after first-ever lacunar stroke. METHODS: A cohort of 95 patients with a first-ever symptomaticlacunar infarct, older than 40 years, MMSE>or=15 and no other neurological or major psychiatric deficits were included. Patients were assessed (clinically and with a neuropsychological test battery) at 1 and 24 months after stroke, and CT was repeated. VMCI was diagnosed when patients had a deficit in at least one cognitive domain, in the absence of dementia. RESULTS: Approximately 75% of the patients had VMCI at 1 month; this percentage was somewhat lower at 2 years. Only initial stroke severity was an independent predictor of VMCI after stroke. CONCLUSION: VMCI is highly prevalent after lacunar stroke, but does not increase during the first 2 years thereafter.
