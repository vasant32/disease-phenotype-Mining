A series of novel 2,7-disubstituted tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives were designed and synthesized. Among these derivatives, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against factor Xa (FXa) and good selectivity with respect to other serine proteases (thrombin, plasmin, and trypsin). In addition, compound 2 exhibited potent anti-FXa activity after intravenous and oral administration to cynomolgus monkeys, showed a dose-dependent antithrombotic effect at 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) in a rat model of venous thrombosis, and significantly reduced the size of brain infarction in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model at a dose of 0.1 mg kg(-1) h(-1). These results suggest that compound 2 (JTV-803) is likely to be useful as both a venous and arterial antithrombotic agent.
