Zygomycetes are among the most frequent causes of non-Aspergillus mycelial fungal infections in transplant recipients. We have described a single case of breakthrough zygomycosis. A young Japanese woman presented because of idiopathic fulminant hepatitis and renal failure. On the third day of admission, she underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A considerable amount of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were transfused during surgery. On posttransplant day 2, Candida albicans was isolated from respiratory secretions; prophylactic caspofungin was prescribed. During the next 6 days, C albicans was isolated from tracheal secretions, surgical wound, and exudates and stools. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was diagnosed day 4. Her renal function did not improve during the postoperative period; the patient continued on hemodialysis. On day 28, a dark blue eschar due to zygomycosis was detected on the skin of the nose. Tracheal and nasal exudates yielded Rhizopus sp. The patient died 12 hours later due to multiorgan failure with hypothermia. The fatal evolution in this case may be related to a presumed brain infarction after progressive vessel fungal invasion. The presented case had 2 risk factors related to zygomycosis. A high index of suspicion is required in transplant recipients with risk factors for zygomycosis. Early diagnosis and surgery with appropriate systemic fungal drugs (amphotericin B) are mandatory to improve the prognosis.
