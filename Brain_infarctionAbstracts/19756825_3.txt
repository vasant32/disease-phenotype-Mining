The leading cause of unfavorable outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is cerebral infarction. In this 3-year retrospective study, we have retrospectively evaluated 172 hospitalized patients with aneurysmal SAH, and compared those who developed a complicated cerebral infarction with those who did not. In this study, acute symptomatic cerebral infarctions accounted for 22.6% (39/172) of all episodes. Significant statistical analysis between the two patient groups included age at onset, hypertension as the underlying disease, presence of symptomatic vasospasm, mean hospitalization days and Glasgow Outcome Score at the time of discharge. After a minimum 1.5-year follow-up period, the median (interquantile range) Barthel index score was 75 (6-85) for those patients who had cerebral infarctions, and 80 (0-90) for those who had no cerebral infarctions. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of symptomatic vasospasm was independently associated with the presence of acute symptomatic cerebral infarctions. The presence of symptomatic vasospasm implies the danger of acute symptomatic cerebral events after aneurysmal SAH. Although our study demonstrates a worse short-term outcome and longer duration of hospitalization in this special group of patients, the functional outcome for patients with cerebral infarction was not inferior to those patients without cerebral infarction after a follow-up of at least 1.5-years.
