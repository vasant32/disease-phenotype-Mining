Right hemisphere (RH) infarct patients have a tendency to begin visual scanning from the right side of a given stimulus. Our aim was to find out whether RH patients with (T+) or without (T-) thrombolytic treatment and healthy controls differ in their starting points in three cancellation tasks. Our sample comprised of 77 patients and 62 controls. Thirty-four patients received thrombolysis. Rightward orientation bias was more evident in the T-â€‰group than in the T+ group. The T+ group showed a robust tendency to start all cancellation tasks more often on the right side than the controls. Regardless of whether they had visual neglect, patients in the T+ group showed still defective rightward orienting, possibly indicating residual attentional problems. The analyses of starting points in visual cancellation tasks provide additional information on residual symptoms of attention difficulties after stroke.
