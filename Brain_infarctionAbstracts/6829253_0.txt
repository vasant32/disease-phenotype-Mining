Curantil intracarotid injection resulted in brain blood supply and in brain oxygen consumption increase as well as in redox processes normalization in 75 cats with main brain arteries occlusion and heart insufficiency induced by chemical necrosis of the myocardium. A single intravenous injection of a higher curantil dose resulted in a significantly less effect. Long-term (3-72 hours) curantil infusion led to the improvement of the functions disturbed (limb movements, speech, vision) in 32 of 42 patients with brain ischemic insult. The greatest therapeutic efficacy was observed in patients with nonobturated brain infarction induced by brain vascular spasm or cardiocerebral vascular insufficiency.
