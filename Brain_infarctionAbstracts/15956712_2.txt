We studied the possible neuroprotective action of relaxin in a rat stroke model. Relaxin (10 ng in 200 nL saline) or saline was injected into the secondary somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats. Thirty minutes after treatment, the right middle cerebral artery was occluded, causing ischemic conditions. Brains were removed 4 hours after stroke, and 1-mm coronal sections were stained using 2-3-5-triphenoltetrazolium chloride. Digital photographs were taken of the sections, and the ratio of infarct area to ipsilateral hemispheric area was calculated. Relaxin treatment significantly (P < .05) reduced this ratio compared with that of saline-treated controls. Results suggest that relaxin may prevent ischemia-induced cell death.
