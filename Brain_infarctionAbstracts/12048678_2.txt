 OBJECTIVE: To identify the A1166/C polymorphism of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) gene in patients with essential hypertension complicated with brain infarction (BI). METHODS: AT1R genotyping with polymerase chain reaction-restrictive fragment length polymorphism was performed in 70 normotensive subjects, 72 hypertensive patients without cardio-cerebrovascular diseases(EH-NCCVD) and 70 hypertensive patients with BI. The relationship between the polymorphism of AT1R gene and plasma lipid levels was also studied. RESULTS: The frequencies of C allele in the two groups of hypertension were higher than that in the health controls, respectively (P<0.05). But there was no significant difference in the frequency of C allele between the two groups of hypertension. A positive correlation was observed between the lipoprotein(a) and AT1R gene A1166/C polymorphism in hypertensive patients. CONCLUSION: AT1R gene contributes to the development of essential hypertensive, but not to the incidence of BI in the hypertensive.
