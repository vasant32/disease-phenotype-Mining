A 20-year-old woman recently diagnosed with acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy developed headaches, weakness, and paresthesias. MR imaging of the brain revealed an acute infarct (demonstrated by diffusion-weighted images) in the head of the right caudate nucleus, a chronic infarct with encephalomalacia in the body of the corpus callosum, and multiple foci of abnormal signal intensity in the white matter of the centrum semiovale.
