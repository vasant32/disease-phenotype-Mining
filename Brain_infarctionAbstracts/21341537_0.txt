Present study was carried out to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of pioglitazone, an antidiabetic agent, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist on acute phase changes in mice model of cerebral ischemia induced by Bilateral Common Carotid artery Occlusion (BCCAO). BCCAO model was used to induce partial global cerebral ischemia. BCCAO induced significant brain infarct size and edema in saline treated control group along with high increase in oxidative stress showed by increase lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of antioxidants like superoxide superoxide dismutage, catalase, glutathione peroxidase. Pioglitazone (20 mg/kg, orally) administration showed neuroprotective effects by reducing cerebral infarct size significantly as compared to control group. Postischemic seizure susceptibility was also reduced as number of positive responders decreased to a significant number. Brain edema was subsided to a significant level. Pioglitazone reduced the plasma TNF-alpha levels as compared to ischemia group significantly. Pioglitazone treatment also improved all the antioxidants levels showing activity against oxidative stress induced by BCCAO. Pioglitazone showed neuroprotection against ischemic insult suggesting the role of PPARgamma agonist in neuroprotective agents.
