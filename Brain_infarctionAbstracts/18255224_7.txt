We investigated the ability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on inhibiting glutamate release by microdialysis in a rat stroke model. Male Wistar rats (n=15) were treated with either intravenous saline or G-CSF (60 microg/kg) 30 min after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). G-CSF significantly attenuated the release of glutamate in the infarcted striatum from 30 minutes to 180 minutes after tMCAO compared with control (p<0.05). Infarct volume in G-CSF treated group (135+/-13 mm(3)) reduced significantly compared to control (181+/-10mm(3)) at 24 hours after tMCAO. The result of present study show that G-CSF possess an ability to inhibit excitotoxicity after ischemic stroke.
