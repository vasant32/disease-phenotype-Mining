 BACKGROUND: Aspirin is an effective and generally accepted treatment drug during the acute stage of ischemic brain infarction. The association between the pretreatment aspirin dosage and fatal outcome among these treated patient groups has not been analyzed previously. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate 14- and 30-day poststroke survival in patients treated with 325 mg immediately on admission to the hospital for prestroke antiaggregation/anticoagulation treatment. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted in a government tertiary care facility. The medical records of all 1245 patients admitted to the hospital for stroke from 1997 to 2002 were reviewed. The association between demographic parameters, stroke risk factors, stroke subtype, prestroke antiaggregation/anticoagulation treatment, and risk of fatal poststroke outcome, 14 days and 30 days after the event, was analyzed using Cox survival analyses. RESULTS: During the 14-day poststroke period, 320 patients (25%) died. By day 30 poststroke, 386 patients (31%) had died. Older age, female gender, chronic heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias were associated with increased risk of increased fatal outcome. Mortality was higher in patients with stroke caused by cardioembolism (P < 0.0001) and was significantly lower in patients with small-vessel occlusion (P < 0.0001). Prestroke medium-dose aspirin treatment was associated with a relative reduction in 30-day poststroke period mortality (P < 0.0001). Conversely, prestroke low-dose aspirin treatment was associated with increased mortality (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Prestroke medium-dose aspirin treatment was associated with reduced 30-day poststroke mortality, whereas low-dose prestroke aspirin therapy was associated with increased 30-day poststroke mortality.
