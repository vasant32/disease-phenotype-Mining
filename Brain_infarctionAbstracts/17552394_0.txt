The authors describe a case of pheochromocytoma presenting with bithalamic infarction, dementia, and elevated intraocular pressure. The patient received glaucoma treatment to suppress high intraocular pressure in addition to antihypertensive and antidiabetic medication for his complaints. Bilateral fundus examination and visual field defects revealed glaucoma-like changes. Adrenelectomy improved all complaints and all medications were stopped. Intraocular pressure and visual field changes improved. Pheochromocytoma presenting with bithalamic infarction, dementia, and increased IOP in the same patient is unusual. Adrenelectomy can improve dementia, increased IOP, and glaucoma-like changes in such cases.
