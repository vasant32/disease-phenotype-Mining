OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of brain infarcts and other intracranial pathology on computed tomography (CT) in patients with greater than 50% internal carotid artery stenosis. DESIGN: Descriptive study of CT findings. SETTING: Referral-based cohort at Groote Schuur Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three patients aged 40-82 years who had CT of the head prior to carotid endarterectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of brain infarct in patients presenting with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke, and yield of unsuspected intracranial pathology other than ischaemic necrosis. RESULTS: Brain infarcts were diagnosed in 54% of patients presenting with TIA and in 73% of patients with stroke. True-positive CT scans were present in only 19% and 44% of patients with TIA and stroke, respectively. A single incidental frontal lobe granuloma, unrelated to the patient's clinical presentation, was noted. CONCLUSIONS: In the selected group of patients referred for carotid endarterectomy, routine use of CT of the head is not indicated and can be reserved for cases with extraordinary clinical features.
