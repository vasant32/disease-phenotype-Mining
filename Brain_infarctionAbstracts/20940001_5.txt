Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the pathology of cerebral ischemia. During prolonged period of stress or when the adaptive response fails, apoptotic cell death ensues. Cerebral ischemic postconditioning (Postcond) has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in both focal and global cerebral ischemia model. However, the mechanism remains to be understood. This study aimed to elucidate whether Postcond attenuates brain I/R damage by suppressing ER stress-induced apoptosis and if the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway is involved. A focal cerebral ischemia rat model was used in the study. Rat brain infarct size and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells in ischemic penumbra were assessed after reperfusion of the brain. The expressions of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), caspase-12, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) in ischemic penumbra were measured after reperfusion. Our results showed that Postcond significantly attenuated brain I/R injury, as shown by reduction in infarct size, cell apoptosis, CHOP expression, caspase-12 activation and increase in GRP78 expression. LY294002, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells suppressed by Postcond in penumbra. In addition, LY294002 diminished the effect of Postcond on the activation of CHOP, caspase-12 and GRP78. These results suggest that Postcond protects brain from I/R injury by suppressing ER stress-induced apoptosis and PI3K/Akt pathway is involved.
