NGP1-01, a member of the pentacycloundecylamine cage compound family, was recently shown to exhibit both NMDA receptor channel blocking and L-type calcium channel antagonism activity. In the present study, focal ischemia was induced in mice by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to test for potential neuroprotective properties of the compound. In female CD-1 mice injected 30 min before MCAO, NGP1-01 (20 mg/kg) reduced infarct area by 42.6% (P < 0.05) compared to vehicle-treated controls as visualized by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Concomitantly, NGP1-01 reduced brain swelling by 78.3% (P < 0.001), compared to vehicle (DMSO) treated controls. These data identify NGP1-01 and related compounds as potential lead structures to develop neuroprotective compounds based on a dual mechanism of action.
