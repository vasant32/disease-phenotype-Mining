An 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a brain infarction presented with a rare distal anterior choroidal artery (AChoA) aneurysm not associated with moyamoya disease manifesting as sudden onset of headache caused by intraventricular hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography revealed a peripheral aneurysm in the left AChoA located distal to the plexal point and steno-occlusive changes of the proximal left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA). Collateral arterial channels to the left MCA and left PCA territories were observed along the left AChoA. No neuroimaging findings were compatible with moyamoya disease. Since the aneurysm did not shrink at 2 months after the onset, endovascular treatment was indicated. Under local anesthesia, a microcatheter was placed into the AChoA proximal to the aneurysm with the aid of a 0.008-inch microguidewire. After a provocation test, three detachable platinum coils were delivered into the aneurysm and the parent artery. Complete obliteration of the aneurysm was achieved without additional neurological sequelae. Successful treatment of a ruptured distal AChoA aneurysm associated with atherosclerotic changes of the intracranial arteries was achieved using a meticulous endovascular technique.
