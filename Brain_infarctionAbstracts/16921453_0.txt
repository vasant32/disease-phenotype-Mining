OBJECTIVE: The aim of this experimental study was to create a new focal venous infarction model in rats. METHOD: 20-male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment. Unilateral frontal strip craniectomy was done in front of the coronal suture. Frontal veins were observed by using the operative microscope. In this study we used the bipolar coagulation method over the transparent dura mater for occlusion of the bridging veins for venous infarction. Specimens were evaluated by histopathological techniques. RESULTS: Unilateral frontal hemispheric swelling, midline shift, brain edema, subcortical petechial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic infarction and necrosis were the histopathological findings on microscopic examination. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the bipolar coagulation method over the transparent dura mater for occlusion of the unilateral frontal cortical veins for venous infarction might be a new experimental model in the evaluation of brain damage after disturbance to the venous circulation.
