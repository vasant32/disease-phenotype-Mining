Suppression of peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs) is one of the major mechanisms of hypothermic protection against transient focal cerebral ischemia. Previous studies have shown the lack of hypothermic protection against permanent focal ischemia. We hypothesized the lack of hypothermic protection was due to the poor efficacy in suppression of PIDs. To examine the hypothesis, we elucidated the effects of hypothermia on the manner of propagation of PIDs with temporal and spatial resolutions using NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) fluorescence images by illuminating the parietal-temporal cortex with ultraviolet light. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (n=14) were subjected to permanent focal ischemia by occlusion of the middle cerebral and left common carotid arteries. 2-h hypothermia (30 degrees C) was initiated before ischemia. Although hypothermia delayed the appearance of PIDs, it did not suppress their appearance. Furthermore, 54% of the PIDs enlarged the high-intensity area of NADH fluorescence in the hypothermia group, similar to the normothermia group (53%). The high-intensity area of NADH fluorescence widened by each PID was larger in the hypothermia group than in the normothermia group. These findings suggest that PIDs even in hypothermia are one of the major factors causing growth of infarction, emphasizing the importance of therapy that targets suppression of PIDs even during hypothermia.
