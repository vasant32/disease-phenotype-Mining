The anatomical complexity of the paraclinoid region has made surgical treatment of intracranial ophthalmic segment aneurysms (OSAs) difficult. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms. We conducted a retrospective study of 28 patients with 30 aneurysms of the paraclinoid in whom treatment with endovascular techniques was attempted. Patient age, sex, presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm type, size of aneurismal sac and treatment modality were reviewed. Clinical evaluation and control angiography were performed between one and 43 months. Overall, complete occlusion was obtained in 26 aneurysms (86.6%), nearly complete (>90%) occlusion in two aneurysms (6.7%) and incomplete occlusion was observed in two aneurysms (6.7%). All endovascular techniques were successful. Procedure-related complications were observed in two patients (7.1%). Patients underwent follow-up for a mean of 14.8 months (range 1-43 months). Repeated coil treatment was performed in one patient. One patient died of massive brain infarction six days postoperatively and thus no follow-up data were available for this case. In 27 patients with follow-up studies, aneurysm closure was complete in 22 (81.5%) and incomplete in five (18.5%). Endovascular treatment is a safe and efficient alternative approach for paraclinoid aneurysms.
