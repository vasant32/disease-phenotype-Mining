Reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was used to test hypothesis that hyperbaric oxygen inhibits the neutrophile infiltration into the ischemic brain thus reducing the brain injury. Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen prior to ischemia or during MCA occlusion significantly reduced neutrophile infiltration, motor disorders, and cerebral infarction volume.
