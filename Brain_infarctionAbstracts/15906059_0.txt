BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Arterial hypertension is the major risk factor for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and lacunar infarction (LI) and both types of cerebral lesions originate from pathology of the same deep perforating small arteries. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between vascular risk factors including common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) with LI versus ICH. METHODS: We prospectively collected data from 159 first ever stroke patients (67 cases with ICH and 92 cases with LI) with documented history of hypertension. All subjects underwent B-mode ultrasonographic measurements of the CCA-IMT. Logistic regression modelling was used to determine the factors (established vascular risk factors, severity and duration of hypertension, concomitant medications and CCA-IMT) that may significantly differentiate LI from ICH. RESULTS: Patients with LI had significantly (p=0.002) larger CCA-IMT values (0.926 mm, 95% CI: 0.881-0.971) than subjects with ICH (0.815 mm, 95% CI: 0.762-0.868) even after adjusting for baseline characteristics and cardiovascular medications. The multivariate logistic regression procedure selected CCA-IMT, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia as the only independent factors able to discriminate between LI and ICH. The risk for LI versus ICH increased continuously with increasing CCA-IMT. For each increment of 0.1 mm in CCA-IMT the probability of suffering from LI versus ICH increased by 36.6% (95 % CI: 13%-65.2%, p=0.001) even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CCA-IMT values are a factor favouring LI over ICH in hypertensive patients. The measurement of CCA-IMT may be a useful non-invasive diagnostic tool for the risk assessment of LI with respect to ICH in such patients.
