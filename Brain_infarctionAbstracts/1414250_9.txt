In a well-defined prospective series of 247 patients with a first-ever supratentorial brain infarct, 15 patients (6%; 95% confidence interval 3-9%) had a large striatocapsular infarct. Twelve (80%) had signs of cortical dysfunction, whereas risk factor profile, frequency of significant carotid stenosis, and frequency of potential cardioembolic sources did not differ between patients with striatocapsular and those with cortical infarction. However, patients with striatocapsular infarction more frequently had potential cardioembolic source and significant carotid stenosis than patients with lacunar infarction. Our findings show that large striatocapsular infarcts differ from lacunar infarcts with regard to both presenting signs and symptoms, and pathogenesis, whereas they resemble infarcts involving the cortex. Such patients should therefore be managed and treated as patients with cortical infarction.
