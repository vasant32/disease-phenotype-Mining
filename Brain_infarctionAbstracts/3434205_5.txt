Twenty-one patients with acute brain infarction, 8 with transient ischemic attack and 20 controls were investigated for lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamine metabolites and cholinesterases. The diseased patients were lumbar punctured on 2 occasions, mean Days 1 (0-3) and 5 (3-9) after debut of symptoms. Monoamine concentrations were determined by reverse phase liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and the cholinergic enzymes were measured photometrically. Increased concentrations of 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HI-AA) and increased activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid was found in patients with acute brain infarction when compared to control values, while the levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were not altered. No change of any neurotransmitter metabolite concentration/enzyme activity were found between Day 1 and Day 5 in the diseased patients. These data suggest an increased release of these neurotransmitter markers from necrotic brain areas into the cerebrospinal fluid and/or altered barriers between blood, brain and CSF and/or a dysfunction of the arachnoid villi to clear substances from the CSF. We therefore concluded that CSF neurotransmitters may be useful as specific brain markers in acute stroke.
