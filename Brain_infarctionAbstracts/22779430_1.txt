 BACKGROUND: Symptomatic thromboembolic events including stroke occur frequently in patients with mechanical heart valves, particularly among those who are poorly anticoagulated. OBJECTIVE: This study set out to determine the prevalence of silent brain infarction (SBI) in this population. METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial carried out in a tertiary-care academic medical center. The trial included participants from a randomized controlled trial of fibrinolytic therapy (FT) in patients with left-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT), who had undergone pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain. The prevalence of SBI in this population was investigated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of silent brain infarction. RESULTS: Silent brain infarction was present in 27 of 72 patients (37.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 27.2, 49.1). Most patients with SBI (57; 82.6%) had sub-therapeutic anticoagulation at presentation. We identified baseline characteristics that were associated with the presence of SBI using a logistic regression model. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was strongly associated with the presence of SBI (odds ratio [OR] 5.60; 95% CI 1.32, 23.87; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of SBI among this cohort of young patients with mechanical heart valves is alarming and calls for urgent efforts to improve the quality of anticoagulation.
