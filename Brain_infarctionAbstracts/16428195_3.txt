When diagnosing and treating patients with acute vertigo, the clinician must differentiate brain lesions from benign peripheral disorders. We here report a rare case of acute vertigo caused by intracranial vertebral artery dissection mimicking peripheral disease. A 67-year-old man presented with spontaneous nystagmus and moderate ataxia preceded by neck pain. No other neurological signs were observed, suggesting acute peripheral vertigo. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a cerebellar infarction. Simultaneous magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed no flow void of the left vertebral artery and contrast-enhanced MRA demonstrated a double lumen sign, suggesting that vertebral artery dissection was a cause of infarction. The clinical course was favorable without anticoagulation drugs, which are sometimes contraindicated because of the potential risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Vertebral artery dissection can cause cerebellar infarction in patients without vascular risk factors mimicking acute peripheral vertigo. Careful history regarding the neck pain is important and MRA in combination with MRI can replace angiography in diagnosing this disorder.
