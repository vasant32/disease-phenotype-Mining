BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this study we investigated whether cerebrospinal fluid in patients with brain infarction possesses an activity that contributes to the evolution of brain ischemia. As a test, the effect of cerebrospinal fluid on Ca2+ influx into the intracellular space was chosen because this process is a mechanism for vasospasm, platelet aggregation as thrombi, and neuron damage. METHODS: Effects of cerebrospinal fluid taken from 48 patients with cerebral hemispheric infarction on the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+ in platelets were studied using the fluorescent probe quin-2. Hemispheric cerebral blood flow was measured using 133Xe intravenous injection. RESULTS: Cerebrospinal fluid in 19 of 48 patients with cerebral hemispheric infarction increased the level of cytosolic free Ca2+ in platelets. The course of the disease in the patients who showed a positive effect of cerebrospinal fluid on Ca2+, when compared with that of patients who showed a negative effect, was characterized by a more severe clinical manifestation and mortality. The decrease in hemispheric cerebral blood flow was more marked in both ischemic and contralateral hemispheres in patients with positive effects of cerebrospinal fluid on the level of Ca2+. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the ability of cerebrospinal fluid to evoke Ca2+ influx into the intracellular space in patients with brain infarction is a factor that aggravates ischemic brain damage.
