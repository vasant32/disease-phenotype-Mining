BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abnormal heart rate variability is related to prognostically unfavorable ventricular arrhythmias and sudden arrhythmic death in coronary artery disease. Short-term electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings have shown similar abnormalities of heart rate variability in patients with acute stroke. However, there is no information regarding the clinical significance of these abnormalities and of heart rate variability in long-term ECG recordings in stroke. METHODS: In this prospective study, we analyzed the time domain and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability from 24-hour ECG recordings in 31 consecutive patients with hemispheric brain infarction in the acute phase and at 1 and 6 months after the infarction and in 31 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. RESULTS: All the measured components of heart rate variability, ie, standard deviation of RR intervals (P < .001), total power (P < .0001), very-low-frequency power (P < .0001), low-frequency power (P < .001), and high-frequency power (P < .05), were significantly lower than those of the control subjects in both the acute phase and 1 and 6 months later. Impaired heart rate variability correlated with the severity of neurological deficits and disability. In five patients with increased intracranial pressure due to large brain infarction, no relevant spectral components were found. CONCLUSIONS: Hemispheric brain infarction seems to cause significant long-lasting damage to the cardiovascular autonomic regulatory system manifested as abnormalities of heart rate variability. Distorted heart rate variability in the acute phase of stroke may be prognostically unfavorable.
