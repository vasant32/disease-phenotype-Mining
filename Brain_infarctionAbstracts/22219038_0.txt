 INTRODUCTION: Complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) include acute oculomotor nerve palsy secondary to ischemic stroke and pituitary apoplexy. These can present with impairment of extraocular muscle function as well as involvement or sparing of the pupil. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 58-year-old male admitted for elective CABG surgery for severe coronary artery disease and found to have a pupil-sparing partial oculomotor palsy post-procedure. Neurological examination revealed left pupil-sparing isolated medial rectus and levator palpebrae superioris paresis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated acute midbrain infarction. CONCLUSION: Acute pupil-sparing partial oculomotor nerve palsy should be recognized as a neurological complication of cardiac surgery. Pupillary involvement can be helpful in identifying the underlying etiology.
