A complex examination of 46 patients with acute disturbances of cerebral circulation in the cerebellum was carried out. A new volumetric coefficient of this area lesion is proposed. The variants of the clinical course of cerebellum hemorrhage and infarctions in respect to the coefficient's value were distinguished. The course is considered favorable if the values are less than 0.08. The higher values indicate, as a rule, a progressive increase of neurological symptoms up to a lethal outcome. The results reveal that the volumetric coefficient of the cerebellum lesion is a reliable parameter both for prognosis and for quantitative evaluation of acute vascular processes in the cerebellum, allowing taking into account the potentials of reserve intracranial space of the posterior cranial focca as well as individual peculiarities of brain and cranial sizes.
