The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of brain infarction after percutaneous implantation of a port-catheter system via the left subclavian artery for hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. In 90 patients with inoperable liver cancer, a port-catheter system was implanted via the left subclavian artery. In 5 patients (5.6%) brain infarction occurred after port-catheter implantation. In one patient (1.1%) thrombi formed around the catheter, as confirmed by autopsy. The risk of brain infarction should be taken into consideration when a trans-left subclavian arterial access route is used for the percutaneous implantation of a port-catheter system for hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.
