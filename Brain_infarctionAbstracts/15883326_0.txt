The authors report a patient with a right frontal stroke who, despite the ability to draw clocks accurately from memory, translocated numbers on the inferior half of the dial to the superior half when copying a clock. In further graphic and verbal clock reproduction tasks, transpositions were always directed toward the model but disappeared in a delayed copying task. These findings appear to reflect an intentional disorder characterized by pathologic approach behavior.
