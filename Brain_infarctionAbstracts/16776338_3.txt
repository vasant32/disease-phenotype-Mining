 OBJECT: The two-vein occlusion model is known to be useful for ischemic penumbra studies in vivo. It was applied here to examine sequential changes in the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins and in apoptotic cells to assess the relationship between penumbra and apoptosis. METHODS: Two cortical veins were occluded photochemically by using rose bengal dye in 27 Wistar rats. The animals were killed with perfusion fixation at the following intervals: 4, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 168 hours after vein occlusion (four at each interval; three additional rats were sham-treated). Immunohistochemical analysis for the Bcl-2 family of proteins was performed along with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay to examine the relationship to single-cell death. Cells positive for antiapoptotic proteins began to appear in the TUNEL assay for animals killed 24 hours after vein occlusion, with a peak at 48 hours. These cells were localized in the core of infarction. Immunohistochemical staining for Bax protein showed an increased presence around ischemic lesions at 4 hours after vein occlusion, and the amounts continued to rise until 24 hours, when the localization was diffuse around the core of infarction. Negative findings on immunohistochemical studies for Bcl-2 protein were seen at the early phase after two-vein occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: After vein occlusion, apoptosis appeared sequentially and widely in cortical lesions considered to be the penumbra. Therefore, control of apoptosis would be expected to offer a therapeutic window for treatment of venous infarction.
