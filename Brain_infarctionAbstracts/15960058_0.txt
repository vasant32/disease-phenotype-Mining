 PURPOSE: To examine whether significant alterations in serum sodium, potassium, and glucose levels occurred after nasogastric tube feeding with iso-osmolar formula in acute brain infarction patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum sodium, potassium, and glucose levels were analyzed by a retrospective medical record review of 85 nasogastric tube-fed patients. FINDINGS: The mean values of serum sodium and potassium levels on the day before, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd days of nasogastric feeding were within the normal range. Alterations in the incidence rates of high, normal, and low level of serum sodium and potassium after tube feeding were not statistically significant. The mean blood glucose levels on the day before, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd days of tube feeding were above normal, and the increase after tube feading was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral tube feeding using iso-osmolar formula did not significantly alter serum sodium and potassium balance. However, most participants were hyperglycemic before and after tube feeding, indicating that hyperglycemia can be induced in the acute stages of brain infarction regardless of tube feeding.
