Previous studies have examined the therapeutic effect of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during the chronic phase of cerebral infarction in rats; however, few studies have investigated the effects of EPCs during the acute phase of infarction. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of EPCs with low aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (Alde-Low EPCs) in rats with acute cerebral infarction, and our results provide insight that may help to identify a therapeutic mechanism of EPCs for acute cerebral infarction. The administration of Alde-Low EPCs into rats with acute cerebral infarction results in the accumulation and migration of the Alde-Low EPCs into the infarct area and the subsequent decrease of infarct volume. Moreover, we found that the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) signaling pathway may regulate the accumulation of Alde-Low EPCs. The transplantation of Alde-Low EPCs may represent a potential treatment strategy for acute cerebral infarction.
