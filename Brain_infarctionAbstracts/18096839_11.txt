 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Even though adiponectin is associated with many traditional cardiovascular risk factors, studies assessing the association between adiponectin and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) are scarce. We assessed the odds of CVD at different plasma levels of adiponectin. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted involving 5243 subjects, drawn from 12 490 subjects of the Jichi Medical School Cohort Study, whose blood samples had been drawn between 1992 and 1995. Over an average of 9.7 years of follow-up, through 2005, 179 patients with cerebrovascular events were identified, in addition to 630 controls matched for age, sex, and community (total n=809). Odds ratios were estimated relative to the highest quartile of adiponectin level. RESULTS: There was neither a significant difference in the odds of stroke between the lowest and highest adiponectin quartiles, nor a significant linear trend toward a reduced risk of stroke at higher adiponectin levels. These results did not change after excluding participants with diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, or metabolic syndrome. The odds of ischemic stroke in the lowest quartile were significantly higher than in the highest quartile, when adjusted for age and sex (OR 2.04 [95% CI, 1.09 to 3.80]). However, the odds failed to achieve statistical significance when adjusted further for other cardiovascular risk factors. Again exclusion of subjects with diabetes, impaired glucose metabolism, or metabolic syndrome did not alter results. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin levels are not independently associated with stroke or brain infarction. The use of adiponectin as a cerebrovascular disease predictor may be premature.
