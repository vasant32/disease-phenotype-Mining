By clinical and post mortem findings we searched for the risk factors, important for brain infarctions in people of nearly 80 years. We were especially interested in the conditions of the extracranial vessels such as the carotid arteries and the murmurs at this point. The number of arterial stenoses in this region, ascertained in younger people is similar in old age. Besides of others factors, caused by old age, the many cases of multiple extracranial stenoses are probably responsible for the overproportional big brain infarctions in this series. In nearly 50% of all stenoses we heard vascular murmurs, mostly in both of the carotid arteries. Despite of some uncertainly of the clinical importance - just in old age many cardiac murmurs of the ejection type with tendency to transmission have been heard - they should give rise to investigate carefully the region of the neck in symptomatic patients.
