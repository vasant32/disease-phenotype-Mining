A patient with hemiplegia and hemihypoesthesia is presented in whom preexisting phantom limb pain disappeared with the appearance of a stroke localized by CT scan to the posterior internal capsule. Differentiation between the cutaneous sensation and the sensation of phantom limb pain that appeared later seems to support the assumed existence of a polysynaptic sensory pathway that conveys the sensations of deafferentation.
