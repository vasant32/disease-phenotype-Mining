Correlation has been carried out between hemodynamic, structural and clinical changes in stenotic lesions of major brain arteries in 175 patients with atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy. The paper analyses the results of ultrasonic and radioopaque diagnosis of vascular lesions of the head and neck, those of clinical, neurological observations and data from computerized tomography scans of the brain. Topographic connections have been established between hemodynamic, structural and neurological manifestations of the disease. It was not infrequently that moderately severe hydrocephaly as one of the manifestations of atrophy of the brain in these patients outstripped brain infarction. Vascular aspect is considered of paresthesias in the extremities by monotype in lesions of major arteries of one of the extremities.
