Bacterial endocarditis is a rare cause of brain infarction. Prediposing factors are frequently valvular defects secondary to rheumatic conditions. A slowly progressive course and atypical symptoms of the disease can mask the condition to such an extent that the correct diagnosis is obtained only through the work up of secondary embolic complications. Modern antibiotic combinations therapy yields a cure in 98% of the cases. The problems obtaining the diagnosis and the course of the disease with antibiotic therapy will be demonstrated in a case of embolic brain infarction secondary to bacterial endocarditis.
