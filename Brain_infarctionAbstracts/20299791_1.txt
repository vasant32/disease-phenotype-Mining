 BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of three or more of the following risk factors: obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated triglyceride level, elevated glucose level, and low high-density lipoprotein level. Lacunar infarcts (LS) account for 25% of all ischemic strokes and are small, deeply located brain infarcts. Two different subtypes exist, which are distinguished by the presence of concomitant white matter lesions (WML) on brain imaging. We determined the prevalence of MetS in LS and the association between MetS with LS subtypes in a series of first-ever LS patients. METHODS: We included 92 patients with a first-ever LS, and 92 patients with a first-ever atheroslerotic cortical stroke (CS) matched for age and sex. LS subtypes were defined according to presence of concomitant WML. We defined MetS retrospectively according to previously defined standards. RESULTS: 35.9% of LS patients and 45.7% of CS patients had MetS (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.37-1.20). MetS was more prevalent in LS without WML than in LS with WML (44.4 and 23.7%, respectively; OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.04-8.47). Similarly, MetS related more to CS compared to LS with WML (OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.03-6.37). CONCLUSION: MetS relates more strongly to LS without WML and to CS, than to LS with WML. Our results suggest a different underlying mechanism between LS without WML and CS, and lacunar stroke with WML.
