OBJECTIVE: Lacunar cerebral infarctions (LACI) in young women is a rare condition which pathogenesis is still not fully recognized. We explored the presence of classic risk factors, hypercoagulability and migraine in young women with LACI. METHODS: Charts of 192 consecutive premenopausal women suffering cerebrovascular insult [125 (65%) haemorhagic, 58 (30%) ischaemic and 9 (5%) unclassified] during a period of 5 years were reviewed. Sixteen out of 58 (27%) patients with ischaemic stroke were identified to have LACI and included in a study. RESULTS: Ten and seven out of 16 LACI women had at least one classical risk factor (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, smoking or oral contraceptives) or migraine, respectively. LACI patients had slight hypercoagulable state indicated by shorter thrombin and thromboplastin times, higher fibrinogen and higher t-PA antigen than 47 age matched controls (all P < 0.05). In addition in LACI patients with migraine the trend toward more pronounced hypercoagulable state in comparison to LACI patients without migraine was found. The combination of migraine, at least one classic risk factor and hypercoagulability was present in 5/16 (31.25%) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of slightly to moderately expressed classic risk factors, hypercoagulability and migraine might be a risk profile for LACI in young women. Further studies are needed to clarify risk profile, rather than isolated risk factors, for LACI in a specific group as young women are.
