Bathing headache is rarely described in literature. We report four middle-aged Taiwanese women who developed severe throbbing headache with maximum intensity of onset during bathing. Diffuse cerebral vasospasm was demonstrated in one of them. All their headaches resolved spontaneously (n = 1) or after nimodipine treatment (n = 3). Except for one patient with vasospasm in whom reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy and an asymptomatic cerebellar infarction developed, the others recovered without any complications. The clinical profile of bathing headache points to idiopathic thunderclap headache. It may not be as benign as previously reported. Nimodipine might be effective in treatment of this special headache syndrome.
