BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accurate and reproducible determination of the size and location of cerebral infarcts is critical for the evaluation of experimental focal cerebral ischemia. The purpose of this study was to compare intracardiac perfusion of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride with immersion of brain tissue in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride to delineate brain infarcts in rats. METHODS: After 6, 24, or 48 hours of ischemia induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, some rats were perfused with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride; other rats were given an overdose of barbiturates, after which brain sections were immersed in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Coronal sections were taken 4, 6, and 8 mm from the frontal pole, and infarct areas in perfused and immersed sections were compared; subsequently, the same sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS: In rats subjected to 24 or 48 hours of occlusion, areas of infarction were clearly defined with both 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining techniques, and the infarct sizes correlated well with the results of hematoxylin and eosin staining (r = 0.85-0.94). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that intracardiac perfusion of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride is an accurate, inexpensive, and efficient staining method to detect infarcted tissue 24 and 48 hours after the onset of ischemia in rats.
