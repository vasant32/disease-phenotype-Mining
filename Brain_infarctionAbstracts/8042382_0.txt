Before and after intravenous administration of 1-1.5 mg nimotop 18 patients with acute brain infarction underwent EEG, integral body rheography, computed tomography and measurement of regional volumetric cerebral circulation (RVCC). Nimotop appeared to increase RVCC in the infarction zone, especially in low initial RVCC levels. The drug induced a shift to EEG normalization and a hypotensive effect, cerebral hemodynamics remaining without changes. Nimodipine-type calcium antagonists favourably affect brain perfusion and bioelectric activity which is promising for application in acute cerebral infarction.
