In a patient, who presented with left sided hemiparesis and right frontal brain infarction, ischemic-like new T wave inversion appeared in a routine electrocardiogram (ECG), performed 2 days after admission. Chest pain or equivalent manifestations, suggesting acute coronary syndrome were denied, and normal troponin level was found. A literature search revealed that a variety of ECG changes might be seen in about 30% of patients with acute stroke. They arise from catecholamine induced myocte injury, and may pose a diagnosis dilemma in the differential diagnosis from ischemic ECG changes. The role of ECG changes in our patient and other patients with similar findings is yet to be determined.
