BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microangiopathy is regarded as an important cause of intracerebral hematoma(ICH) and lacunar infarction. Dot-like low intensity spots on T2-weighted echo planar image(EPI) have been regarded as hemosiderin deposit associated with microangiopathy. However, clinical significance of dot-like hemosiderin spot(dotHS) is still debated. Therefore, we analyzed the number of dotHS on EPI of symptomatic lacunar infarction associated with ICH. METHODS: To investigate how the dotHS or risk factors contributed to hemorrhagic strokes for patients with lacunar infarction, the number of dotHS and various risk factors were made a comparison between 20 cases with symptomatic lacunar infarctions(lacunar group) and 5 cases with both symptomatic lacunar infarction and symptomatic ICH(complicated group). In addition to EPI, fluid attenuated inversion recovery image, and T1- and T2-weighted MR images were performed for differential diagnosis of dot HS. RESULTS: EPI demonstrated that asymptomatic ICH was significantly more frequent in complicated group (60%) than in lacunar group(10%), and dotHS were significantly more frequent in complicated group(100%) than in lacunar group(50%). The number of dotHS of complicated group was 14.6 +/- 4.3, which was significantly larger than that of lacunar group(4.1 +/- 9.2). No significant difference between two groups were founded in other risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that dotHS was one of the risk factors for ICH for patients with symptomatic lacunar infarction, and an increasing number of dotHS was one of the predictive factors of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic ICH.
