Multiple infarcts were produced in cerebral hemispheres of rats by injecting calibrated 50-micron microspheres into the left internal carotid artery, and alterations in lipid and energy metabolism were evaluated 24 hours later in the embolized hemisphere. Total phospholipid content was decreased by 26%, but the different classes of phospholipids were not equally affected. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine levels were decreased by about 40% and phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine by 25%, while sphingomyelin level remained unchanged. There was a 3.2-fold increase in total free fatty acid content with a relatively larger rise in polyunsaturated free fatty acids 20:4 and 22:6 (20-fold increase). Determination of enzyme activities showed decreases in Na+,K+-ATPase (-21%) and hexokinase (-14%) but no changes in phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Study of energy metabolism using the closed system method of Lowry et al showed a significant depression (-36%) of the cerebral metabolic rate. Taken together, these data suggest a relation between lipid alterations and dysfunction of energy metabolism. Phospholipid degradation with subsequent free fatty acid release and alteration in membrane-bound enzymes may have a direct effect on metabolic machinery and may slow cerebral metabolic rate.
