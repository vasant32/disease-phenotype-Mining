In this study, diffusion tensor MRI was used to examine the restoration of the cerebral white matter of macaque monkeys after unilateral cerebral multiple microinfarctions. Post-stroke, the monkeys showed deficits in several neurological functions, including motor functions, but most of the deficits resolved within 6 weeks. Very interestingly, the fractional anisotropy (a value determined by diffusion tensor MRI), of the monkeys' affected motor pathways dropped transiently, indicating a damage in the neural tracts. However, it returned to normal levels within 6 weeks after the stroke, concomitant with the gradual recovery of motor functions at subacute phase.
