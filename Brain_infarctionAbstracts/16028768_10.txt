 OBJECT: The authors examined whether delayed treatment with Mg++ would reduce brain infarction and improve electrophysiological and neurobehavioral recovery following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 minutes followed by 72 hours of reperfusion. Magnesium sulfate (750 micromol/kg) or vehicle was given via intracarotid infusion at the beginning of reperfusion. Neurobehavioral outcome and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were examined before and 72 hours after ischemia-reperfusion. Brain infarction was assessed after the rats had died. Before ischemia-reperfusion, stable SSEP waveforms were recorded after individual fore- and hindpaw stimulations. At 72 hours of perfusion the SSEPs recorded from ischemic fore- and hindpaw cortical fields were depressed in vehicle-injected animals and the amplitudes decreased to 19 and 27% of baseline, respectively (p < 0.001). Relative to controls, the amplitudes of SSEPs recorded from both ischemic fore- and hindpaw cortical field in the Mg++-treated animals were significantly improved by 23% (p < 0.005) and 39% (p < 0.001) of baselines, respectively. In addition, Mg++ improved sensory and motor neurobehavioral outcomes by 34% (p < 0.01) and 24% (p < 0.05), respectively, and reduced cortical (p < 0.05) and striatal (p < 0.05) infarct sizes by 42 and 36%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Mg++ at the commencement of reperfusion enhances electrophysiological and neurobehavioral recovery and reduces brain infarction after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Because Mg++ has already been used clinically, it may be worthwhile to investigate it further to see if it holds potential benefits for patients with ischemic stroke and for those who will undergo carotid endarterectomy.
