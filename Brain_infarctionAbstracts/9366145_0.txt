The effect of FK 506, an immunosuppressant which is widely used in the transplantation of liver, kidney and bone marrow, on cerebral infarction volume in transient focal ischemia was investigated. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by 2 h occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery in rats. FK 506 (0.3 mg/kg body weight) and vehicle were administered intravenously immediately after induction of cerebral ischemia. After 24 h reperfusion the rats were sacrificed and brain infarct volume and edema volume were determined. The FK 506 treatment group showed a significantly reduced infarct volume in the cerebral cortex when it was compared with the vehicle treatment group, but infarct volume was not significantly reduced in the striatum which was the ischemic core in this focal ischemia model. However, FK 506 did not reduce the edema volume significantly. These results suggest that the reduction of infarct volume is a result of the neuroprotective effect of FK 506. This immunosuppressant may be useful in the treatment of cerebral infarction.
