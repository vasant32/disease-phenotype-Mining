A 71-year-old man presented with right hemiparesis and aphasia due to cerebral infarction in the frontal lobe. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a high-density mass, 12 mm in diameter, in the stem of the left sylvian fissure. Carotid angiography demonstrated occlusion of the left ascending frontal artery complex and retention of contrast medium at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The diagnosis was cerebral infarction caused by occlusion of the ascending frontal artery complex resulting from thrombosed left MCA aneurysm. The patient was managed conservatively and his neurological symptoms gradually improved. One month later, he lapsed into a coma. CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage. Carotid angiography showed a large left MCA aneurysm with branch occlusion of the left ascending frontal artery complex. A left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. The MCA aneurysm was opened and the intramural thrombi removed, and finally neck clipping was performed. The patient made a good postoperative recovery.
