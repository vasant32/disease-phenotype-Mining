A 2-day-old boy had hemi-convulsion and diagnosed as having neonatal infarction. Brain MRI was performed on the day after the day of onset. Abnormal finding were noted on diffusion weighted imaging, but not on T1 and T2 weighted imaging. During the first few days of life, it is difficult to demonstrate neonatal brain infarction by T1 and T2 weighted imaging. Diffusion weighted imaging is useful for the early diagnosis of neonatal infarction.
