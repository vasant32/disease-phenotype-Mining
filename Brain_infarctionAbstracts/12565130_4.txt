Human monocytes and a variety of tissue macrophages, including microglia, were studied immunohistochemically to determine the expression of a novel microglial marker, human glucose transporter 5 (hGLUT5), in these cells. The hGLUT5 was not expressed in most peripheral macrophages in the normal state, but weakly expressed in some foamy macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions. There was no hGLUT5 reactivity in blood monocytes. In the lesions of brain infarcts, foamy macrophages (predominantly monocyte-derived cells) in the ischemic core were mostly negative for hGLUT5, while activated and phagocytic microglia in the transitional zone were consistently positive. The present study indicated that unlike other microglial markers, hGLUT5 is rarely present in peripheral macrophages, and that hGLUT5 immunohistochemistry is useful in distinguishing microglia-derived macrophages from monocyte-derived macrophages in acute necrotic lesions.
