We examined brains clinicopathologically from 54 consecutive paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) patients aged 70 years or older and compared them with those of 59 age-matched controls. Symptomatic cerebral infarctions were present in 29 PAF patients (53.7%) and in 13 controls (22.0%) (p < 0.001). Symptomatic brain infarction was 2.4 times more common in PAF cases than in PAF-free controls; approximately 60% of the infarctions in the PAF cases were judged to be cardioembolic in origin. PAF in the elderly can be an important cause for cardiogenic cerebral embolism.
