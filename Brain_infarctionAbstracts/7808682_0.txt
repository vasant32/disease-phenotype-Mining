In an epidemiological research about stroke, we studied 235 patients with atherothrombotic brain infarctions and 81 patients with lacunes. It was a longitudinal study concerning patients admitted to our Medical Division during the acute phase and followed up for one year after the onset. We report some anamnestic data, the frequency of positive brain CT scan, main risk factors, symptoms at the onset, severity degree of the stroke within the first 72 hours, complications during, and outcome after, the first four weeks, including personal performances and environmental fitness, mortality rate and frequency of relapses. We also report some of these data after one year from the acute episode.
