SunBio1 (SB1) is a novel polyethylene glycol-bovine hemoglobin conjugate. It is a small molecule that shows high oxygen-delivery capacity, and exhibits extended plasma half-life compared to hemoglobin alone, thus reducing renal toxicity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate potential neuroprotective effects of SB1 using a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model. The middle cerebral artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded with a thrombotic blood clot and SB1 was administered via intra-arterial infusion 5 min after the operation. Brain tissue was harvested after 2 h, and cerebral infarct volumes were calculated from coronal sections stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Three to 6 days after the procedure, sub-groups of animals were subjected to an open field test and the Morris water maze to assess locomotor activity and learning/memory function. Thrombotic blood clots induced extensive brain infarction and edema; however, these were significantly reduced in SB1 treated animals. In addition, SB1 treatment increased locomotor activity in open field tests, and improved the learning/memory deficits caused by the thromboembolism. These results suggest that SB1 has neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain injury caused by thromboembolism.
