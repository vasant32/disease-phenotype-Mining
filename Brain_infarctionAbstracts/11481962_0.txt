Cocaine is a common drug. Myocardial infarcts and brain infarcts related to the use of cocaine were previously reported in the medical literature. We report a 34 year old patient admitted for severe chest pain, a few minutes after cocaine use. He was found to have an acute myocardial infarction with significant left ventricle dysfunction. Coronarography conducted a few days later was found to be normal. Cocaine use may cause acute myocardial infarction in young and healthy people with no other risk factors.
