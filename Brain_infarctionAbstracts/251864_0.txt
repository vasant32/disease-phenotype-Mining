The investigations were carried out in 30 control cases, in 20 patients with acute transient cerebral circulatory failure, 20 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, and 22 patients with thrombotic encephalomalacia. The determinations of uropepsin activity were done on the 1st, 3rd, 7th and 14th days of the disease. Uropepsin activity in 24-hour urine was determined by the method of West, Ellis and Scott. In the group of patients with acute transient cerebral circulatory failure abnormalities in urinary uropepsin activity were not significant. The mean activity of uropepsin in 24-hour urine in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and brain infarction on the 1st day of the disease was significantly higher than in controls. The rise in the activity of this enzyme in patients with encephalomalacia was lower in relation to patients with intracerebral haemorrhages. During improvement of the condition of patients with brain stroke the uropepsin activity in 24-hour urine decreased.
