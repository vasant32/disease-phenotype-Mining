Cerebrovascular complications of meningitis have been extensively documented in the literature. It is little known, however, that paroxysmal, devastating, and potentially fatal complications can occur when the early signs of infection are subtle and missed. We describe the clinical course and neuropathological findings of the occurrence of brain infarctions during two atypical clinical courses of meningitis. In one patient, it was due to Serratia marcescens detected only by an autopsy specimen, and in the other, it was due to Aspergillus detected by a surgical biopsy. Death followed multiple, extensive, and progressively multiplicative infarctions in the basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebral cortices. Autopsies revealed that the infarctions were caused by severe inflammatory change in the vascular walls, mainly of the arteries of the skull base, including the basilar and carotid arteries. Thrombus formation was also recognized in the lumen of several arteries. A number of characteristic Aspergillus hyphae were recognized in the arterial wall of one patient. Meningitis, which may be associated with severe vasculitis and lead to cerebral infarction, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these conditions. Early diagnosis and initiation of vigorous therapy should be stressed for therapeutic success.
