A 58-year-old man was admitted due to mild right-sided hemiparesis and a speech disturbance. We diagnosed an atherosclerotic brain infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere. The patient had severe clubbing of his fingers and toes bilaterally. Based on the history, clinical features, and X-ray examinations, he was diagnosed as having pachydermoperiostosis. Although general complications have been reported in previous literature, this is the first report of a patient with pachydermoperiostosis who had a cerebrovascular event.
