The association of habitual snoring with cerebral ischaemia was studied, in a case control-study, in 133 patients aged 45-75 years (103 men and 30 women) and 133 controls matched for sex and age. Ischaemic stroke was confirmed by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. History of risk factors, especially of snoring and sleeping habits was recorded with structured questionnaire during interview. Prevalence of habitual snoring significantly differs between patients with stroke and controls: 31/133 (23.3%) vs 11/133 (8.3%) (Odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 7.6, p < 0.001). Even after adjusting for matching variables and confounding risk factors (arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, and obesity), habitual snoring carries a significant risk factor for stroke (odds ratio: 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 6.8 (p = 0.01)). The risk of ischaemic stroke was higher among older male patients with arterial hypertension who always snored. Habitual snoring was not significantly linked with sleep-related stroke nor with the pathophysiology of strokes. Inquiring about habitual snoring should become a routine practice, especially among older male patients with arterial hypertension, and specific preventive measures should be instituted at an earlier stage.
