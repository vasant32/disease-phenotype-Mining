The authors evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506), administered alone or in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), on brain infarction following thrombotic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Thrombotic occlusion of the MCA was induced by a photochemical reaction between rose bengal and green light in Sprague-Dawley rats, and the volume of ischemic brain damage was determined 24 hours later. Intravenous administration of tacrolimus or t-PA dose-dependently reduced the volume of ischemic brain infarction, whether administered immediately or 1 hour after MCA occlusion. When tacrolimus or t-PA was administered 2 hours after MCA occlusion, each drug showed a tendency to reduce ischemic brain damage. However, combined treatment with both drugs resulted in a significant reduction in ischemic brain damage. On administration 3 hours after MCA occlusion, tacrolimus alone showed no effect, and t-PA tended to worsen ischemic brain damage. However, the combined treatment with both drugs not only ameliorated the worsening trend seen with t-PA alone, but also tended to reduce ischemic brain damage. In conclusion, tacrolimus, used in combination with t-PA, augmented therapeutic efficacy on brain damage associated with focal ischemia and extended the therapeutic time window compared to single-drug treatments.
