The authors present the clinical picture and time-course of aphasia (A) in 25 patients, 18 of whom had had hemorrhagic and 7 ischemic stroke. Dynamic neuropsychological examination and computer-aided tomography (CT) of the brain were carried out. The development of marked and stable A was observed in 20% of the cases. The frequency was higher with brain infarction and lower with cerebral hemorrhage. In 3 cases of deep localization of brain infarction the authors describe a peculiar speech syndrome not observed in other aphasic patients. It was characterized by (1) intactness of mechanisms underlying the realization of speech despite the presence of marked aphasia, (2) greater variability and inconsistence of results of implementation by patients of speech tasks. Clinico-CT correlations gave grounds for explaining the rate and degree of speech recovery, as well as the nature of A with the predominant lesion to some or other deep structures of the left hemisphere of the brain.
