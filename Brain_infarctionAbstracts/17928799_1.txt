GADD34 is expressed in the ischaemic brain and reverses protein synthesis shutdown. Consequently, GADD34 could have neuroprotective potential in stroke. BHK medium, a replication-deficient HSV viral vector (HSV1716) with no insert or containing full-length GADD34, the N terminal or a conserved portion of the gene, was injected into mouse brain before stroke. Infarct size was 1.0+/-0.26, 1.19+/-0.36, 1.5+/-0.36, 1.3+/-0.36, and 1.1+/-0.28 mm3, respectively. The increase in infarct size with full-length GADD34 was statistically significant (P<0.05). Immunohistochemistry confirmed viral protein expression. Tissue culture studies revealed GADD34 gene restored virulence in HSV1716, suggesting that HSV virulence, rather than increased GADD34, exacerbated ischaemic damage.
