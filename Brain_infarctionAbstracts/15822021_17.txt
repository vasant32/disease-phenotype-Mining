We report the results of three years of the population-based, prospective Swiss NeuroPaediatric Stroke Registry (SNPSR) of children (up to 16 years) with childhood arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS1), neonatal stroke (AIS2), or symptomatic sinus venous thrombosis (SVT). Data on risk factors (RF), presentation, diagnostic work-up, localisation, and short-term neurological outcome were collected. 80 children (54 males) have been included, 40 AIS1, 23 AIS2, and 17 SVT. The data presented will be concentrated on AIS. The presentation for AIS1 was hemiparesis in 77% and cerebellar symptoms and seizures in 20%, respectively. AIS2 presented in 83% with seizures and in 38% with abnormality of muscle tone. Two or more RF were detected in 54%, one RF in 35%. The most prominent RF for AIS1 were infections (40%), followed by cardiopathies and coagulopathies (25% each). AIS2 were frequently related to birth problems. Neurological outcomes in AIS1 and AIS2 were moderate/severe in 45 % and 32 %, respectively. The outcome correlated significantly with the size of infarction (p = 0.013) and age at stroke (p = 0.027). The overall mortality was 6%. Paediatric stroke is a multiple risk problem, which leads to important long-term sequelae.
