Thirty-eight cataract eyes and 15 artificial aphakic or pseudophakic eyes were enrolled in this study to determine levels of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in human aqueous, using a radioimmunoassay. Neither hEGF nor bFGF were detected in either congenital cataract eyes or senile cataract eyes without any complication. In cases of senile cataract complicated with glaucoma and traumatic cataract, bFGF range from 0.4 to 0.8 ng/ml whereas hEGF was not detected. In cases of senile cataract with myocardial or brain infarction and anterior subcapsular cataract, bFGF was detected ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 ng/ml and in some of the cases hEGF was detected at a level of 1.0 ng/ml. hEGF was detected at 1.0 ng/ml in some cases of secondary cataract after uveitis, cataract complicated with retinal detachment, cataract after scleral buckling or vitrectomy, and aphakic or pseudophakic eyes after extracapsular cataract extraction or phacoemulsification. These results showed that hEGF and bFGF exist at a level of about 1 ng/ml in human aqueous in some pathological states and it seems possible that proliferation of lens epithelial cells is promoted by the growth factors, with the result that after cataract, anterior capsular opacities and shrinkage become severe.
