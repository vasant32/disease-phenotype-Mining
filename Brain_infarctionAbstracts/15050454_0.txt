We report the case of an 84-year-old woman who suddenly developed motor and both superficial and deep sensory hemiparesis on the left side, and cervical dystonia with a head tilt to the right side. A brain MRI showed an infarct in the left lateral caudal medulla. It is clinically important to recognize that the lateral caudal medullary infarction appears without signs and symptoms of lower cranial nerve palsies commonly involved in Wallenberg syndrome.
