Decreased plasma level of antithrombin III was assumed to be one of the major factors underlying hypercoagulable state in nephrotic syndrome. Concentrated antithrombin III preparation was given to 8 children with nephrotic syndrome with a plasma antithrombin III activity of less than 70%, to evaluate the effect on hypercoagulable state. Plasma antithrombin III activity was elevated to more than 70% in 7 of 8 children after treatment, while plasma levels of plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex and FDP-D dimer were not significantly decreased. One patient developed brain infarction after the treatment, suggesting that prophylactic administration of concentrated antithrombin III preparation is not fully protective against thrombotic complications in nephrotic syndrome.
