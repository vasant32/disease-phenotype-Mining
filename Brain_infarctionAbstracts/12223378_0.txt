We examined the cerebellar metabolism of a 61-year-old man with a small infarct in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and an intact cerebellum. Positron emission tomographic images obtained 28 days after onset showed prominent hypoperfusion and hypometabolism (almost 50% below the normal level) in the left cerebellar hemisphere. This case report shows that neural deafferentation may cause prominent hypometabolism without morphologic changes in the cerebellum. An arrest in synaptic activity may be the most important factor for the adaptive decrease in oxygen metabolism seen in ischemic brain.
