A case of pure mutism without pseudobulbar palsy and other neurological findings resulting from simultaneous bilateral lenticulostriate artery territory infarction is presented. A 45-year-old woman suffered a transient ischemic attack with nonfluent aphasia and right hemiparesis. Six months later, she developed pure mutism without oral apraxia, pseudobulbar signs, and motor deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral infarction in the lentiform nucleus regions. In the available data, there is only one report of simultaneous bilateral lenticulostriate infarction. To date, in all reported cases of mutism of subcortical vascular origin there are also various degrees of pseudobulbar signs and motor deficits and the responsible lesions are mostly consecutive. The case presented here is the first to show pure vascular mutism without other neurological findings.
