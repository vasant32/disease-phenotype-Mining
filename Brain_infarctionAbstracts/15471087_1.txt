We report a 46-year-old woman with Buerger's disease who presented vascular dementia. In her early thirties, she began to feel cold sensation and pain in the lower extremities and later developed Raynaud's phenomenon in the upper extremities. The diagnosis of Buerger's disease was established on the basis of angiographic findings which showed the obstruction of peripheral vessels in both anterior tibial arteries. She was admitted to our hospital because of a transient attack of left brachial monoparesis and two episodes of epileptic seizure with progressive cognitive impairment for preceding five years. Neurological examination revealed acalculia, constructional apraxia, recent memory disturbance, and hyperreflexia of the left limbs without motor disturbance. Brain MRI revealed multiple infarctions mainly located in the border zone territories of the major cerebral arteries. Conventional angiography failed to detect abnormalities of cerebral vessels. She had no cardiovascular abnormality or coagulopathy. Cerebrovascular complications, so-called cerebral thoromboangiitis obliterans (CTAO), occur approximately in 2% of patients with Buerger's disease. CTAO has two types. Type 1 is associated with large artery changes and type 2 is associated with medium and small artery changes. Patients with type 2 CTAO usually have multiple infarcts in the cerebral arterial border zones and may develop progressive cognitive decline without motor deficit. Her clinical features are compatible with type 2 CTAO. While CTAO is a relatively rare manifestation of Buerger's disease, it should be suspected in cases of Buerger's disease in association with cognitive impairment of unknown onset.
