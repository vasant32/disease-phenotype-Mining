A case of alexia without agraphia is presented. It is a rare but classic disconnection syndrome, first described by Dejerine in 1892. Recent advances in modern neuroimaging techniques such as FLAIR MRI can now localise in vivo the site of origin of the syndrome, especially when computerised axial tomogram of the brain is normal.
