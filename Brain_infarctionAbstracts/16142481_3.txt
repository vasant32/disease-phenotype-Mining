Coil fracture represents a serious device-related complication during coil embolisation of intracranial aneurysms. If the coil cannot be retrieved completely, the loose end floating in the parent vessel can prolapse into the distal part of the vessel and may cause occlusion and brain infarction. We present a new technique in which the loose end of the fractured coil is fixed with a stent at the proximal parent vessel wall. Herniation of the loose coil end to the distal part of the vessel with potential vessel occlusion is therefore prevented. This procedure was technically feasible in all cases and no clinical complications were encountered. We suggest this new technique as a treatment option in cases of fractured coils.
