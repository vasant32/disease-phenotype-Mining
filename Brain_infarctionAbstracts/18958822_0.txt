High intracranial pressure (ICP) is the most frequent cause of death and disability after severe traumatic brain injury and malignant cerebral infarction. After failure of general therapeutic maneuvers and first line therapies, "second tier" therapies have to be considered. Decompressive craniectomy is an advanced treatment option for controlling intracranial pressure (ICP). In this review indications and techniques of decompressive craniectomy are described and current literature is discussed. The author concludes that decompressive craniectomy is no routine, but should be considered in individual cases.
