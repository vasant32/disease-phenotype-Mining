The carotid bifurcation was studied histologically in 53 consecutive autopsies from persons over 65 years of age who were asymptomatic for carotid artery disease and showed no carotid related brain infarcts. The autopsy material is considered to be representative for the population in Oslo. The area stenosis was determined morphometrically in histological sections and the cases were examined for the occurrence of atherosclerotic plaques, calcifications, plaque hemorrhages, ulcerations, and mural thrombi. About one half of the cases had more than 50% stenosis. There was increasing frequency of plaque hemorrhages, ulcerations and mural thrombi with increasing stenosis. When the stenosis exceeded 60%, most cases had small recent and old plaque hemorrhages and one half had ulcerations and mural thrombi. In addition, numerous healed ulcerations and organized thrombi were seen. It is concluded that plaque complications are frequent in cases with stenosis and that most of them apparently heal without giving rise to symptoms. The presence of such lesions in asymptomatic cases must therefore be interpreted with caution.
