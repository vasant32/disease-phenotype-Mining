Complex movement disorders (CMD; including tremor, dystonias, choreoatheosis, and myoclonus) following infarcts in the posterior and posterolateral thalamic nuclei have been reported. This case of a 59-year-old man who developed CMD following bilateral paramedian and bilateral cerebellar infarcts illustrates the lack of anatomic specificity and the diverse pathophysiology which may underlie CMD.
