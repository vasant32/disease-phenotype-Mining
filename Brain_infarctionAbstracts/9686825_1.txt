We present a 3-year-old patient with stenotic kinking of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) who developed an ischaemic infarction of the left brain hemisphere followed by severe neurological sequelae after a prolonged generalized seizure. At time of the seizure the boy was in biological remission of a nephrotic syndrome and received prednisolone and cyclosporin A (CsA) treatment. The haemodynamic consequences of inborn kinking of the ICA is discussed controversely in the literature. The presented case shows that stenotic kinking of the ICA may significantly impair the blood flow towards the homolateral hemisphere and therefore may result in an ischaemic infarction. The influence of CsA on seizure activity is discussed. CONCLUSION: This case provides clinical and radiological evidence supporting an association between stenotic kinking of the carotid artery and homolateral hemispheric brain infarction.
