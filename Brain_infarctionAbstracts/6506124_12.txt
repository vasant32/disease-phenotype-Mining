Between 1980 and 1982, 227 consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic brain infarction (IBI) were evaluated as possible candidates for carotid surgery in the Department of Neurology, University of Helsinki. One hundred and ten patients (mean age 58, range 41-72 years) were selected for surgery; 82 of them had had TIA and 28 IBI as the presenting symptom. After a total of 128 operations (84 unilateral and 18 bilateral endarterectomies, and 8 arterial reconstructions), 16 patients (14.5%) developed neurological deficits. In 7 patients (6.4%), the deficit was severe and 4 of them (3.6%) died within the first four days after surgery. Ten patients had occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery and/or severe hypertension. Five of them suffered ischemic brain infarction after the operation and two died. Operation on an occluded internal carotid artery in 7 patients was complicated by hemiparesis in two patients, one of whom died. Patients with surgical complications more often had severe hypertension (p less than .001), total occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery, (n.s.) and severe angiographic changes (n.s.) compared with patients without complications. During the follow-up the annual rate for IBI was 3.3% and for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 4.4%. Vascular death occurred with a frequency of 1.7% per year. The results emphasize that patients with TIA or IBI should be carefully evaluated before recommending surgical treatment for prevention of threatened stroke. Patients with severe risk factors may fare better on medical treatment than with surgical intervention.
