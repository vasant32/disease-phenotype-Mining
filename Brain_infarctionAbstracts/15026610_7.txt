An increase in the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCA-IMT) is generally considered as an early marker of atherosclerosis and has been associated with a higher risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. There is no evidence of an association between the IMT and cerebral bleeding. We investigated cross-sectionally the diagnostic ability of vascular risk factors, including CCA-IMT, to distinguish between brain infarction (BI) and intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Patients suffering from BI (n = 126) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher CCA-IMT when compared to the ICH population (n = 30). The multinomial logistic regression procedure selected CCA-IMT as an independent factor able to discriminate between BI and ICH. The risk of BI versus ICH increased continuously with increasing CCA-IMT. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors the odds ratio for BI per 0.1 mm CCA-IMT increase was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.03-1.61). The present results demonstrate the possible predictive power of non-invasive measurement of the CCA-IMT with respect to BI versus ICH and deserve further investigation.
