Nervous central system involvement is observed in two out of three patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and probably, the true prevalence is even higher than that clinically detected. The coexistence of neurosyphilis in this group of patients has been poorly studied and the possibility that some alterations in the natural history of syphilis related to its rapid course with respect to time in which neurologic involvement would occur would have reasonable immunologic basis. We report two patients aged 26 and 22 who presented antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus together with meningo-vascular syphilis with spinal involvement and secondary brain infarction, respectively. In both patients, neurosyphilis was the first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus infection and none of them referred a history of previous primary or secondary syphilis.
