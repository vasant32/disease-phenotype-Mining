 PURPOSE: We examined the seropositivity of specific antibodies IgG and IgA to Chlamydia pneumoniae in the patients with ischemic stroke and examined if it has a notability in stroke patients with or without silent brain infarcts. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of 26 cases with silent brain infarcts (SBI) without acute stroke and 26 cases with acute ischemic stroke without SBI (30 male, 22 female) were prospectively gathered. Risk factors were noted in all subjects. Control group was consisted of fifty-three healthy volunteer blood donors (40 male and 13 female). The presence of C. pneumoniae specific IgG antibody in serum samples was determined by indirect micro-immunofluorescence test according to the method of Wang and Grayston (Euroimmun GmbH in Deustchland) and of specific IgA antibody in serum samples was determined by indirect micro-immunofluorescence test with the manufactured kit Orgenium-Helsinki. The results were evaluated according to the groups and to the risk factors. RESULTS: There was not any correlation between risk factors and C. pneumoniae seropositivity. Seropositivity for specific IgG antibody for C. pneumoniae was observed as 73.8% in SBI, as 61.5% in stroke and as 56.3% in control groups. Seropositivity for specific IgA antibody for C. pneumoniae was observed in 7 out of 16 SBI cases (43.8%) SBI and in 9 out of 19 stroke cases (47.3%) with positive IgG antiobodies. CONCLUSION: We could not confirm a relation of C. pneumoniae seropositivity neither with SBI nor with acute stroke.
