 INTRODUCTION: Both for hemicraniectomy and for hypothermia, several reports describe a beneficial effect in patients with malignant supratentorial cerebral ischemia. We compared the safety and the clinical outcome in patients with a malignant supratentorial infarction who were treated with hemicraniectomy alone (HA) or received a combination therapy with hemicraniectomy and hypothermia of 35 degrees C (HH), respectively. METHODS: In a prospective and randomized study, 25 consecutive patients were treated after an ischemic infarction of more than two thirds of one hemisphere by HA (n=13 patients) or the HH combination therapy (n=12 patients). Safety parameters were compared between both treatment groups, the clinical outcome was assessed during treatment and after 6 months. RESULTS: Age, cranial CT or MRI findings, initial National institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSSS) and level of consciousness were not significantly different between both groups. Hemicraniectomy was performed within 15+/- 6 h after the ischemic event. Hypothermia was induced immediately after surgery. Overall mortality was 12% (2/13 vs. 1/12 in the two groups), but none of these 3 patients died due to treatment-related complications. There were no severe side effects of hypothermia. Duration of need for intensive care or for mechanical ventilation and infectious status did not differ significantly between both groups, but the need for catecholamine application was increased in the HH group. The clinical outcome showed a tendency for a better outcome in the HH compared with the HA group with respect to status after 6 months, as assessed by the NIHSSS (10+/-1 vs. 11+/-3, p<0.08). DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that a combined therapy of mild hypothermia and hemicraniectomy in malignant brain infarction does not imply additional risks by side effects and improves functional outcome as compared with hemicraniectomy alone.
