The neuroprotective window of magnesium for up to 8 h after ischemic insult was evaluated in a clinically relevant model of focal cerebral ischemia subjected to embolization of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) with an autologous thrombus. The animals were treated with either vehicle or 5% magnesium sulfate (90 mg/kg) intravenously at 2, or 6, or 8 h after ischemic insult. Survival rate significantly increased only in animals treated with magnesium sulfate in treatment groups at 2 h after MCA embolization but improvement in neurological outcome was observed in all medicated groups. Compared with animals in control group, post-ischemia treatment with magnesium sulfate significantly reduced brain infarct volume (P<0.01) except the 8 h group. These data indicate that the therapeutic window for neuroprotection of magnesium can be extended up to 6 h in the focal cerebral ischemia model of this study. The long window of opportunity for effective dosing may be explained with the proposed multiple mechanisms of actions for magnesium.
