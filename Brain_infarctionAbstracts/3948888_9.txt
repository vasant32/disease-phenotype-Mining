The aim of this 4-year follow-up study was to find out how often dementia appears after stroke in unselected material. All patients younger than 65 years (52) still alive 4 years after stroke in a stroke register (total 255 patients) were studied neurologically and neuropsychologically. Three patients with brain infarction filled the criteria for mild dementia. This is more than was to be expected. All 3 demented patients could be classified as multi-infarct dementia. The findings concerning dementia are discussed.
