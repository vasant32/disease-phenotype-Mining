Ipsilateral hemiparesis after a supratentorial stroke is rare. However, the role of the reorganization of the unaffected hemisphere in recovery after a stroke is poorly understood. Two patients developed ipsilateral hemiparesis after a left corona radiata infarct. Both of these patients had previously experienced contralateral hemiparesis after a right-sided supratentorial stroke. Functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral motor area activation during paretic left hand movement. This finding suggests that the ipsilateral hemiparesis was caused by a new stroke in the ipsilateral motor system that was functionally reorganized after the previous stroke.
