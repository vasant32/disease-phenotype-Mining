 INTRODUCTION: Unilateral neglect after acute right hemispheric stroke significantly impedes poststroke recovery. We studied patients with right hemispheric stroke to determine whether increasing age was associated with more frequent or more severe neglect. METHODS: Eight neglect tests within 5 days of symptom onset (and within 24 hours of admission) were administered to 204 subjects with acute right hemispheric stroke. Size of infarct was measured, and neglect tests were scored as percent error. "Any neglect" was defined by an elevated neglect test score, standardized relative to a group of normal controls. RESULTS: When tested for neglect soon after acute stroke admission, 69.6% of subjects older than 65 years had "any neglect" (defined by comparison to a group of normal controls), compared with 49.4% of subjects aged 65 years and younger (p = 0.008). For every additional 10 years of age, patients were 1.83 times as likely to have neglect, even after adjusting for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (95% CI 1.38-2.43). In addition, DWI volume and NIHSS independently predicted neglect. Score on virtually all of the neglect tests worsened as an effect of age. Percentage error on a line cancellation task was 3.8% higher for every additional 10 years of age, after adjustment for DWI volume and NIHSS (p = 0.006). Similar results were found for other neglect tests. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age in patients with acute right hemispheric stroke significantly increases the odds of unilateral neglect as well as severity of neglect, independently of size of the stroke or NIH Stroke Scale score. The reason for this finding in older patients may be because they have more brain atrophy and may be less able to compensate for cerebral infarction, or because they tend to have more cardioembolic strokes, which may be more cortically based.
