Fasting blood glucose level, glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1) and fructosamine (FA) were measured in 37 non-diabetic patients with a recent (48 h) brain infarction of the carotid territory. The severity of hemiparesis was assessed on admission, and in the 2nd week and 1st month. The functional outcome and fatality rate was estimated after 1 month. On the basis of elevated the HBA1 concentration the group of 54% patients was diagnosed to have prestroke hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia predating cerebral infarction did not influence fasting glycemia during the few days after stroke. Fasting blood glucose concentration but not the preceding 2-3 months and 2-3 weeks glycemia correlated strongly with the severity of hemiparesis and predicted stroke outcome. Measurement of HBA1 seems to be useful as a screening test for mild, clinically silent diabetes in patients without other risk factors for cerebral stroke.
