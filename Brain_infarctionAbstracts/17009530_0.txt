 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of erectile dysfunction (ED) in old males with lacunar infarction. METHODS: A total of 38 old patients ages from 60 to 70 years were involved. The questionnaire of international index of erectile function 5 (IIEF -5) was used to determine the status and severity of ED. According to the focus of infarction on MRI, the patients were divided into two groups, Group I with lacunar infarction and minor neurological deficits, and Group II with none. The total IIEF-5 scores were compared between the two groups and repeatedly evaluated six months after discharge. RESULTS: According to the total scores of IIEF-5, the prevalence of ED in Group II (95%) was higher, and the incidence of severe ED was significantly increased (60.0% vs. 44.4%, P < 0.05) as compared with Group II. In both the two groups, severe ED was more often seen in diabetic patients. At six months after discharge, the total scores of IIEF-5 were significantly increased (11.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 15.6 +/- 2.2, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: ED is significantly increased in old males with lacunar infarction, and it is more severe in diabetic patients. Post-stroke rehabilitation care helps to improve ED.
