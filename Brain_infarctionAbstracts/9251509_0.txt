We report a case of a postoperative brain infarction, in which an asymptomatic preoperative brain infarction was also revealed postoperatively. A 63-year-old man with bladder carcinoma was scheduled for the cystoplasty. The patient had no prominent preoperative abnormality. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in N2O/oxygen combined with a spinal block and a continuous epidural block. Anesthesia lasted uneventfully for 16.5 hours. However, emergence from anesthesia was delayed. On the first postoperative day, motor aphasia and right hemiparalysis was confirmed. The computed tomography (CT) of the brain demonstrated a low density area in the frontoparietal region. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated the corresponding lesion as the CT had demonstrated, and an old brain infarction in the parietal region. This meant that the patient had a history of asymptomatic brain infarction (ABI). Patients with ABI are considered to be a high-risk group for a brain infarction. It is important to evaluate the risk factors of brain infarction preoperatively and to minimize those risks during the operation. Maintenance of the cerebral perfusion pressure is imperative.
