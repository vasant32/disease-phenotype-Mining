A reliable focal cerebral ischemia model is essential in evaluating the efficacy and safety of neuroprotective therapy for stroke. We present a focal embolic ischemic model of rat with reproducible and predictable brain infarction by comparing it with two other most commonly used focal cerebral ischemia models. To produce embolic focal cerebral ischemia, 30 male Wistar rats were subjected to injection of 30 microl hydrophilic polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) or an autologous thrombus or intraluminal filament occlusion in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) (n = 10 in each group). The percent of brain infarct volume at 48 h after ischemia, neurobehavioral score at 2 h before and after ischemia, intracranial hemorrhagic incidence, and premature reperfusion rate at 3 h after ischemia by MCA angiography were assessed respectively and compared between the focal cerebral models. We found that PVS-induced focal cerebral ischemia had more consistent brain infarct size with less dispersion (32.2+/-7.4%, CV = 0.23) than that with an intraluminal filament occlusion (27.6+/-11.4%, CV = 0.41) or an autologous thrombus embolization (27.2+/-11.8%, CV = 0.43). Injection of PVS also caused more severe neurobehavioral deterioration (3.8+/-0.4) than those produced by two other models (filament, 3.1+/-0.9, P = 0.02; thrombotic, 3.5+/-0.5, P = 0.08). Additionally, animals with PVS-induced focal cerebral ischemia suffered less intracranial hemorrhage (PVS, 0/10, filament, 3/10, thrombotic, 3/10), and less premature reperfusion as determined by MCA angiography (PVS, 0/10, filament, 4/10, thrombotic, 3/10). Our data suggests that permanent focal cerebral ischemia with high reproducibility and low mortality can be achieved by introducing PVS into the right MCA.
