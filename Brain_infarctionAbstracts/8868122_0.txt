To investigate influence of social activity on normal brain aging, we studied the social activity score, cognitive functions, self-rating depression scale, cerebral blood flow (CBF), MRI and motor function in the normal elderly people living in different social environments. There was no difference in risk factors for stroke, MRI findings and CBF between the two groups. However, the subjects living in a home for elderly showed significantly lower social activities than those living with families. Cognitive functions and motor function were lower, and SDS was higher in subjects living in retirement house than those living with families. The social environment including social activities closely related to life style may significantly influence brain aging with regard to silent brain infarctions or risk factors for stroke.
