OBJECTIVES: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism may play a role in stroke and silent brain infarction (SBI) susceptibility, but the results among the populations studied to date have not been consistent. Thus, we investigated the association between ACE genotypes and ischemic stroke and SBI in Korean patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DNA samples from 237 stroke patients, 264 SBI patients and 234 age-matched controls were amplified using polymerase chain reaction to detect the ACE ins/del (I/D) polymorphism. Genotype was determined by the presence of a 490-bp band (I allele) or a 190-bp band (D allele) in agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Odds ratios of the I/D and D/D genotypes and the overall (I/D + D/D) for the I/I genotype were significantly different between stroke patients and normal controls. However, there was no significant difference between patients with SBI and controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of a significant association between ACE polymorphism and ischemic stroke in the Asian population. Although no consistent associations have been found between ACE polymorphism and stroke in the populations studied to date, the ACE polymorphism may be a genetic determinant of ischemic stroke, at least in Korean patients.
