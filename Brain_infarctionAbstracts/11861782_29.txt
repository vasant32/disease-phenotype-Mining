This study examined the protective effects of cilostazol on cerebral infarcts produced by subjecting rats to 2-h occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery followed by 24-h reperfusion. The ischemic cerebral infarct consistently involved the cortex and striatum. The infarct size was significantly reduced, when rats received 10 mg/kg cilostazol intravenously 5 min or 1 h after the completion of 2-h ischemia. Cyclic AMP level was significantly elevated in the cortex of 4- and 12-h reperfusion (P < 0.01) following treatment with cilostazol (10 mg/kg, 5 min after 2-h ischemia) accompanied by decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha level. Samples from the regions corresponding to the penumbra showed markedly reduced Bcl-2 protein level and, in contrast, high levels of Bax protein and cytochrome c release. Cilostazol decreased Bax protein and cytochrome c release and increased the levels of Bcl-2 protein. Cilostazol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) potently and concentration dependently scavenged hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals. In conclusion, cilostazol treatment decreases ischemic brain infarction in association with inhibition of apoptotic and oxidative cell death.
