Deep-brain lacunar infarct represents a significant clinical problem as it produces severe symptoms highly resistant to rehabilitation. The limited area of necrosis may facilitate neurorepair via the action of various novel neuroprotective strategies including cell-based therapies. The lesion was induced by stereotactic injection of ouabain into adult rat brains. Subsequent behavioral testing involved beam walking task, rotarod, visual discrimination task and apomorphine rotation. For morphological and topographical analysis brain slices were stained with H-E and evaluated under light microscopy. Lesion size was measured in absolute terms and in relation to the whole brain volume. Immunohistochemical analysis for the co-localization of BrdU with specific cell-type markers (PSA-NCAM, NG2, beta-tubulin III, GFAP, ED1) have has been performed, to determine the fate of newly generated cells with emphasis on evidence of neurogenesis. The lesion involved the basal ganglia, basal forebrain nuclei, internal capsule and striatum (just 1-2% of total brain volume). Significant and relatively stable behavioral deficits were observed up to 30 days. Furthermore, large numbers of cells are seen to be newly generated in response to injury with a significant proportion of these being present on account of neurogenesis.
