 BACKGROUND: The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) concluded that "there is currently no reason to doubt that the reduction of dependent survival or death after endovascular coiling seen in all patients in the ISAT cohort should not be valid in the elderly". We feel that this generalization requires further investigation to assess its validity. METHODS: We studied the impact of treatment era and independent risk factors for outcome in 179 consecutive elderly (> or =70 years) aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients admitted to Kuopio University Hospital either between 1983 and 1992 (Era I, n = 56), prior to the introduction of endovascular management, or between 1995 and 2004 (Era II, n = 123) when the endovascular treatment was established at our institute. Altogether 150 patients underwent occlusive aneurysm treatment, 47 clipping in the Era I as against 49 clipping, 49 endovascular therapy, and five combination therapy in the Era II. RESULTS: The 12-month survival (n = 179) did not improve from the Era I to the Era II. The proportion of good outcome (GOS IV-V) after occlusive therapy (n = 150) was equal in the Era I and Era II (n = 27/47; 57% vs. n = 56/103; 54%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of poor outcome were age, poor grade (Hunt&Hess IV-V), hydrocephalus, hypertension, and intraventricular hemorrhage, but not the mode of occlusive therapy (microsurgical vs. endovascular) CONCLUSION: Clinical severity of the SAH was the most significant predictor of outcome. Integration of coil treatment in clinical practice has not improved the overall outcome of aSAH in the elderly at our institute.
