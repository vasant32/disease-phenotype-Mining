The aim was to study if neural grafts placed brain infarcts could improve functional recovery. The middle cerebral artery was occluded (MCAO) in 19 spontaneously hypertensive rats. Nine rats were sham operated. Twelve to 16 days after the ischemic insult, 9 of the MCAO rats received transplants of dissociated fetal neocortical tissue (MCAO-T) and 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation surgery, the rats were behaviorally evaluated by a test for forelimb function. Infarct and transplant sizes were measured morphometrically. The remaining volume of the infarcted hemisphere was 66 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD) in the MCAO group and 71 +/- 9% in the MCAO-T group of the non-operated hemisphere. All grafted rats had surviving transplants. Contralateral to the lesion, paw-reaching was highly impaired in both infarcted groups compared with sham-operated controls with no significant difference between MCAO and MCAO-T. The lesion size correlated significantly with contralateral paw-reach performance at all test periods. We conclude that neocortical grafts did not alleviate the impaired forepaw function.
