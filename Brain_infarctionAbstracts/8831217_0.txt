This study was performed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of fast fluid attenuated inversion recovery (fast FLAIR) images in diagnosing brain infarction compared with fast spin-echo (fast SE) images. Fast FLAIR and fast SE images were obtained in 32 patients with brain infarction. Infarctions close to the sulci were difficult to differentiate from the real sulci on fast SE images, but were clearly depicted on FLAIR images. Linear foci along with cortex were especially well demonstrated on FLAIR images. On the other hand, foci that showed high signal intensity on fast SE images were sometimes appeared as having low or iso signal intensity on FLAIR images. These foci, suspected of being cystic lesions, were sometimes difficult to identify on fast FLAIR images. For the above reasons, we concluded that fast FLAIR and fast SE each have advantages and disadvantages in the detection of brain infarctions.
