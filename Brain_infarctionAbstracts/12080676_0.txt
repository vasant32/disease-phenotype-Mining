Hemodynamic parameters of middle cerebral artery(MCA) were measured with Transcranial Doppler (TCD) in 31 elderly patients with brain infarction during convalescence and 28 healthy elderly controls. Twenty-two elderly patients with brain infarction and cerebral hemodynamic impaired were treated by External Counterpulsation(ECP). The results showed that the Vp and Vm of MCA in patients were significantly lower than that in the healthy controls(P < 0.001), the DVp, DVm and asymmetry of MCA in patients were greater than that in the healthy elderly(P < 0.001, P < 0.005). The Vp and Vm of MCA in patients after ECP were significantly higher than before(P < 0.001). The DVp, DVm and asymmetry of MCA in patients after ECP were significantly lower than before(P < 0.001, P < 0.005). The hemodynamic therapeutic effect is 81.8%.
