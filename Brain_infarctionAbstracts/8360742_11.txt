The case is presented of a 23-year-old man suffering ischemic brain infarction from spontaneous thrombosis of a left posterior cerebral artery P1-P2 junction aneurysm. Vasospasm and/or partial parent vessel occlusion were documented by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and angiography. Repeat cerebral angiography and MR imaging 3 months later revealed patency of the posterior cerebral artery and luminal filling of a 1-cm fusiform aneurysm, which was successfully trapped at surgery.
