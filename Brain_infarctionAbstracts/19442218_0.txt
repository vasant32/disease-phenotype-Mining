We have previously shown the neuroprotective effect of atypical antipsychotic agents by experimental cerebral ischemia. However the impact of their high dose related side effects on their low dosage related neuroprotectivity is still unknown.We evaluated the possible neuroprotective effects of high dose olanzapine (10mg/kg) treatment on ischemic brain injury 24 hr after permanent cerebral ischemia. Olanzapine showed neither a neuroprotective nor a neurotoxic effect after focal cerebral ischemia. This finding could suggest that dose related side effect of olanzapine could involve a restriction of its neuroprotective effect unlike lower doses that have been reported to have neuroprotective effect.
