We divided patients with brain lesions into three groups: (a) patients with primary or metastatic brain cancer, (b) brain infarctions, and (c) brain contusion(s). We analyzed each patient's sera for creatine kinase isoenzyme BB (CK-BB), using a monoclonal antibody kit (Impres-BB; International Immunoassay Laboratories). Computerized axial tomography (CAT) scans were performed on each patient. The size of the various lesions was measured from the CAT scan and recorded in milliliters. Total CK, CK-BB, and their ratios were compared with the volume of damaged brain tissue. We found no correlation between any of the variables and the various brain lesions. We attribute this lack of correlation to an intact blood-brain barrier, the rapid elimination or inactivation of CK-BB, or some combination of these factors.
