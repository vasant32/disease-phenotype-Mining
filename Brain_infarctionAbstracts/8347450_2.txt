The neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an idiosyncratic reaction to major tranquilizer drugs characterised by hyperpyrexia, extrapyramidal disorders and altered consciousness. First described in 1968 by Delay and Deniker, early case reports suggested a mortality of between 20 and 30%. Though the syndrome is now more widely recognised, the diversity of its clinical features may not always be appreciated and may lead to diagnostic confusion with other, more common, disorders. We report on two severe cases of NMS: in the first the diagnosis was initially thought to be sepsis from a urinary tract infection, and in the second the primary clinical diagnosis was of a mid brain infarction.
