A 50-year-old woman presented with rare multiple dissecting aneurysms that appeared first in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and shortly afterwards in the vertebral artery (VA). She initially suffered sudden motor weakness in the left lower limb due to acute brain infarction. Angiography revealed diffuse string sign in the right ACA. Conservative treatment resulted in resolution of the deficits. Follow-up angiography performed 1 year later revealed recovery of the ACA stenosis. Fourteen days later, she complained of sudden headache and became comatose. Computed tomography showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiography revealed a new right VA dissecting aneurysm involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The orifice of the dissection was not apparent in the operative field and the dissection extended to the median. The patient underwent extracranial right VA ligation, clipping of the proximal PICA, and revascularization between the right occipital artery and distal PICA. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged without neurological deficits. VA dissecting aneurysms involving the PICA without evident orifice or extending over the median can be treated by extracranial ligation with clipping of the PICA, followed by revascularization.
