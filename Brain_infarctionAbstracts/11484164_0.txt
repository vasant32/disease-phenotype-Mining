OBJECTIVE: To analyze the hereditary susceptibility for HLA-DQA1 alleles according to trait of multiple genes leading to disease in atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI). METHODS: HLA-DQA1 alleles in ABI patients (n=81) and healthy controls (n=99) were detected by PCR-SSP techniques. RESULTS: (1)The frequency of HLA-DQA1*0301 was significantly higher in ABI patients. (2)The frequency of HLA-DQA1*0301 was significantly higher in patients with family history of essential hypertension (EH). (3)The frequency of HLA-DQA1*0103 was significantly lower in ABI patients. CONCLUSION: HLA-DQA1*0301 allele might be a correlative gene with hereditary susceptibility of ABI and HLA-DQA1*0301 allele might be a correlative gene in ABI patients with the family history of essential hypertension, whereas HLA-DQA1*0103 allele might be a protective gene in the patients with ABI.
