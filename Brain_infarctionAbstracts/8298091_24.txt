Using a mouse model with intraluminal blockade of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) which produced both cortical and striatal infarction, the effect that superoxide radicals have on cerebral infarction, local cerebral blood flow, and neurological deficits after 24 h of permanent focal cerebral ischemia in transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing human CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) was examined. There were no difference between SOD-1 Tg mice and non-Tg littermates observed in the infarct areas of brain slices, the infarct volume, the local cerebral blood flow, or the neurological deficits. These data suggest that pre-existing high levels of antioxidant enzyme failed to provide neuronal protection against permanent focal cerebral ischemia.
