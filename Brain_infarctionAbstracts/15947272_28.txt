 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue destruction produced by the neuroinflammatory response that follows ischemic stroke. In the present study we use an MMP array to investigate the blood levels of several MMPs in stroke patients and its relation with brain tissue damage and neurological outcome. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion who received thrombolytic therapy were included. Blood samples were drawn before tissue plasminogen activator treatment and an MMP array (multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) was performed including gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), collagenases (MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13), stromelysines (MMP-3 and MMP-10), and MMP endogen inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). To assess tissue lesion a serial multimodal MRI study was performed (pretreatment and at 24 hours). RESULTS: Neither initial diffusion lesion nor hypoperfused volume was associated with metalloproteinase expression within the first 3 hours after stroke onset. Nevertheless, a strong correlation was found between MMP-9 and MMP-13 with diffusion-weighted image (DWI) lesion expansion (r=0.54, P=0.05 and r=0.60, P=0.017, respectively). Baseline levels of both MMP-9 (OR, 14;95% CI, 1.5 to 131; P=0.019) and MMP-13 (OR, 73; 95% CI, 3.9 to 1388; P=0.004) were independent predictors of final increase in brain infarct volume at 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that within the neuroinflammatory response, high levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 are involved in DWI lesion growth despite thrombolytic therapy, suggesting its ultra-early role in brain injury.
