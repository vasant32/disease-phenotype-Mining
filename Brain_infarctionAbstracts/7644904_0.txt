A consecutive series of 1400 patients who had undergone open-heart surgery was retrospectively reviewed concerning postoperative cerebral dysfunction. The 30-day mortality was 1.6%. Forty-one patients (2.9%) showed signs of cerebral dysfunction, which proved fatal in seven cases. Neurologic symptoms were observed immediately after surgery in 14 patients, suggesting intraoperative damage. In 20 others there was an interval between surgery and the onset of cerebral symptoms, which in 12 cases were preceded by supraventricular tachycardia. Computed tomographic scans were performed on 27 patients and showed recent brain infarction in 22. No bleeding was found. At follow-up 34 of the 41 patients were alive, 21 of them with neurologic sequelae and 13 reporting complete recovery. Nineteen of the 34 survivors experienced no diminution of quality of life. Since half of the cerebral complications occurred postoperatively, more aggressive prevention and management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and anticoagulation therapy should be considered.
