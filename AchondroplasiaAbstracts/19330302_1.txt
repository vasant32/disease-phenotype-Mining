 OBJECTIVE: Mutation analysis in Indian children with achondroplasia. METHODS: We studied 11 sporadic cases of achondroplasia. Mutation analysis was done by PCR/RFLP (Polymerase chain reaction/Restriction fragment length polymorphism) method. RESULTS: Nine of the 11 cases had mutation G-->A at 1138 nucleotide position in transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth-factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Substitution G-->A is a common recurrent mutation reported worldwide. In two cases we could not detect any common mutation and also in entire region of transmembrane domain sequenced. There is possibility of mutation in the other regions of FGFR3 gene in these two cases. CONCLUSION: Further study of these two cases is needed in order to define other genotypes resulting in achondroplasia. Postnatal diagnosis of achondroplasia depends on clinical and radiological features. Mutation detection is mainly useful for prenatal diagnosis.
