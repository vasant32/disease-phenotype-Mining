We report a distinct type of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia seen in 2 sibs and their second cousin, characterized by early onset severe short stature, small chest, and distended abdomen. They had short neck, severe lumbar lordosis, and marked genu varum due to fibular overgrowth and joint laxity. Radiographically, the patients had platyspondyly, initially noted during the first years of life, with central hypoplasia of the vertebral bodies. At a later age, the vertebrae appear squared with mild interpedicular narrowing. The long bone changes, which at early age resemble those seen in achondroplasia, later include general metaphyseal irregularities and significant epiphyseal ossification delay. These patients present a previously undescribed form of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, most probably transmitted as an autosomal recessive tract.
