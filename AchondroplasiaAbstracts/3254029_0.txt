The aim of surgical orthopaedics in short stature is to increase overall height and improve body proportions. It is particularly applicable to lower limb lengthening in achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, Turner's syndrome and Ellis-van Creveld syndrome. Two methods are routinely used in Verona: chondrodiatasis and callotasis. Although simultaneous lengthening of tibia and femur of the same limb have generally been employed, recent efforts have concentrated on simultaneous lengthening of one femur and the contralateral tibia. Lengthening of up to 20-25 cm can now be achieved, with a complication rate below 20%.
