We report the case of an unrestrained driver with achondroplastic dwarfism who suffered a fatal anterior neck injury when her airbag deployed as she rear-ended another vehicle at 30-40 mph. Her short stature and short limbs required her to sit within a handbreadth of the steering wheel, which probably allowed the airbag or airbag cover to strike her neck as it opened. This is the first reported case of fatal injury to a driver with achondroplastic dwarfism.
