 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop a simple technique to manufacture individualized ventilatory nasal masks for pediatric patients using materials and procedures commonly applied in dentistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three cases of pediatric patients who met with severe difficulties in their adaptation to commercially available nasal masks are described: one premature infant, one child diagnosed with achondroplasia, and one child with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. RESULTS: In each case, a light nasal mask was designed with two independent parts that become perfectly adapted to the patient's nose: one soft for the skin contact, and another rigid for dimensional stability. In all patients, adequate levels of ventilation were reached. CONCLUSION: This easy, inexpensive nasal mask fabrication technique can be used in a great number of patients, increasing the efficacy of individualized masks.
