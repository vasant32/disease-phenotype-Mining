We report for the second time on a case of achondroplasia with synostosis of multiple sutures. The most common mutation for achondroplasia (FGFR3 Gly380Arg, resulting in 1138G>A) was identified. Imaging studies disclosed complex craniosynostosis and neurosurgical intervention was carried out, particularly for posterior plagiocephaly.
