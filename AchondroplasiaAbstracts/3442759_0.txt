The authors describe the favourable outcome of general anaesthesias in a female patient with achondroplastic dwarfism and in another patient with dystrophic dwarfism. In the first patient the gall-bladder was removed and a plastic reconstruction of the diaphragm was carried out. In the second patient a Girdlestone's operation was performed. The difficulty of intubation of the dystrophic dwarf due to stiffness of the cervical spine suggested a procedure of intubation under fibroscopy. The doses of agents and the size of the tracheal tubes were calculated on the basis of the patients weight and the controlled ventilation was carried out after determining the current volume and the respiratory frequency in the awaken patient.
