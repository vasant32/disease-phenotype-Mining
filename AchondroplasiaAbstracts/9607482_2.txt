The authors describe a radiographic method to quantify a surgical procedure of thoracic expansion in a 2-year-old patient with achondroplasia, small chest cage, and severe restrictive lung disease. The patient had undergone three surgical procedures of thoracic expansion since birth. The authors utilized computer-generated lung volume histograms after spiral computed tomographic scanning and three-dimensional imaging of the lungs to calculate his lung volumes before and after the third surgical thoracic expansion. The lung volumes, calculated by the histograms, were 363 mL and 406 mL before and after surgery, respectively. This 40-mL difference in the patient's lung volumes (4 mL/kg) accounted for a significant clinical improvement. Lung volume histograms obtained by this radiographic method are very helpful in substantiating a successful surgical chest expansion or provide an explanation for an unsuccessful repair.
