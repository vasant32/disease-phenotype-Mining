Callotasis is a lengthening technique that involves slow, controlled distraction after subperiosteal-submetaphyseal osteotomy. The technique and its advantages over other methods are described. Results of lengthenings involving 270 operated bone segments (146 femurs and 124 tibias) in 140 patients are reviewed. Ninety-five patients had limb-length inequality and 45 had hypochondroplasia or achondroplasia. On average, 6.6 cm, or 24.6% of initial length, was gained. The mean healing index was 39; the complication rate was 13.3%.
