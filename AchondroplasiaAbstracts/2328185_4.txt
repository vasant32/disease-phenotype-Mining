We describe the successful management of a 26-yr-old achondroplastic dwarf undergoing elective Caesarean section under extradural anaesthesia. The patient had marked thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis and clinical features which suggested that tracheal intubation would prove difficult. Block sufficient for surgery required only 5 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and, apart from an initial unilateral block and mild intraoperative hypotension, her perioperative course was uneventful.
