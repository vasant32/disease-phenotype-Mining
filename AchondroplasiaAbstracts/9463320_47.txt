Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are autosomal dominant osteochondrodysplasias that result in mild to severe short-limb dwarfism and early-onset osteoarthrosis. PSACH and some forms of MED result from mutations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP; OMIM 600310 [http://www3.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov:80/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?600310]). We report the identification of COMP mutations in an additional 14 families with PSACH or MED phenotypes. Mutations predicted to result in single-amino acid deletions or substitutions, all in the region of the COMP gene encoding the calmodulin-like repeat elements, were identified in patients with moderate to severe PSACH. We also identified within this domain a missense mutation that produced MED Fairbank. In two families, one with mild PSACH and the second with a form of MED, we identified different substitutions for a residue in the carboxyl-terminal globular region of COMP. Both the clinical presentations of these two families and the identification of COMP-gene mutations provide evidence of phenotypic overlap between PSACH and MED. These data also reveal a role for the carboxyl-terminal domain in the structure and/or function of COMP.
