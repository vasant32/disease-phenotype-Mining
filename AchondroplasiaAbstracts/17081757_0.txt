Patellofemoral disorders in achondroplasia, to our knowledge, have not been reported in the literature. We describe an unusual case of bilateral locked knees in an achondroplastic patient secondary to intra-articular subluxating patellae and symmetrical chondral flap lesions of the femoral trochlea which were treated by arthroscopic resection. We suggest that abnormal kinematics may cause patellofemoral complications in achondroplasia.
