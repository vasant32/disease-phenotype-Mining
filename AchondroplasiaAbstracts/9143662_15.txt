BACKGROUND: Quantitative histomorphometric features of the bone growth plate in the human rib have been investigated in infants, ranging in age from 3-36 weeks (mean 18.6 weeks) to provide data currently not available. METHODS: Measurements were taken in each histological zone of the growth plate. Data from 20 cases were pooled and parameters describing the characteristic features of trabecular bone calculated using morphometric formulae. The measurements were made from the resting zone of the cartilage to the secondary spongiosa, 3.78 mm from the starting point. RESULTS: Cartilage volume fraction decreased from 78% in the resting zone to a bone volume fraction of between 20% and 30% in the secondary cancellous bone. Cartilage matrix surface increased rapidly in the cartilage and bone mineral surface declined in correspondence with the development of primary bone. The distance between chondrocyte lacunae was observed to decrease throughout the cartilage to a transverse septa thickness of 18 microns in the hypertrophic zone. A rapid increase in trabecular thickness to 128 microns was observed in the primary spongiosa, the secondary spongiosa ranging between 137 microns and 168 microns. Spacing, chondrocyte profile transverse diameter, increased to 30 microns in the hypertrophic zone, following which an increase in trabecular separation to 347 microns was observed in the primary spongiosa. The number of transverse intervals between individual chondrocyte lacunae was observed to increase in the cartilage to a maximum of 21.3 cartilaginous or mineralised septa per mm of growth plate length in the hypertrophic zone. Trabeculae in the metaphysis then decreased in number to approximately 1.5 trabeculae per mm in the secondary spongiosa. CONCLUSIONS: These data thus provide new insight into the development of trabecular structure during growth and normal values for the comparison of tissue from skeletal dysplasias and growth disorders.
