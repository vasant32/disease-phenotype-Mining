Severe obstructive sleep apnea in a patient with achondroplasia syndrome was found to result in a definitive deficiency of overnight growth hormone secretion related to absence of slow-wave sleep. Resolution of the apnea by tracheostomy resulted in normalization of growth hormone release and normal growth rates postoperatively. Sleep-related growth hormone deficiency may contribute to the short stature so often seen in a variety of craniofacial syndromes. Furthermore, this short stature may be reversible.
