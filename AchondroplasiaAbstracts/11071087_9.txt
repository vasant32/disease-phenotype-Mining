Hypochondroplasia is characterized by a disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening of the limbs. Amino acid substitutions Asn540Lys, Asn540Thr and Ile538Val in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) are considered to cause hypochondroplasia. In this study we examined the FGFR3 gene for the previously described hypochondroplasia mutations and the phenotype of 23 probands with clinically and radiologically diagnosed hypochondroplasia. For the phenotype comparison, the patients were divided into two groups: Group 1: hypochondroplasia with Asn540Lys substitution; Group 2: hypochondroplasia with no mutations identified so far. A three-generation family negative for the known hypochondroplasia mutations was examined with polymorphic markers flanking the FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes. Nine (39%) of 23 probands were found to be heterozygous for the Asn540Lys substitution. The individuals positive for the Asn540Lys substitution were significantly more disproportionate than the individuals without this mutation. In this respect, a genotype-phenotype correlation was found in our patients. However, some individuals belonging to the group without mutations identified so far showed similarly abnormal proportions. Genotyping/haplotyping in the three-generation family with hypochondroplasia showed that FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes were not linked to the hypochondroplasia phenotype in this family, thus further confirming the genetic heterogeneity of hypochondroplasia. CONCLUSION: Individuals with hypochondroplasia heterozygous for the Asn540Lys substitution are significantly more disproportionate than individuals without this mutation. Our study further confirms the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of hypochondroplasia.
