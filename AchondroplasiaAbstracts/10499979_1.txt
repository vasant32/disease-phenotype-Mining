A 9-yr-old white female with achondroplasia was one of a group of 773 children who were recruited for a study of the accumulation of whole body skeletal mass during four annual measurements. Measurements of bone, fat, and lean mass were obtained with a Hologic 1000W instrument. The following variables are used to compare the subject with the 130 healthy white girls who participated in the study: bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD). Ratios of BMC to weight or BMC to height, and BMD to weight or height, were also calculated. We found that the BMC of the subject was lower when compared to the reference group, but the ratios of BMC to weight or BMC to height were similar in both. BMD was also lower in the patient, but, when expressed in relation to height and weight, the ratios were similar or slightly higher in the case. BMAD was higher in the subject with achondroplasia at all ages. The subject had a lower percentage fat and higher percentage lean mass than the reference children. We conclude that the accumulation of bone mass in this subject with achondroplasia is appropriate for her reduced body size.
