A 21 year-old woman with achondroplasia exhibited locking of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the right index finger which required surgery to release the joint. Locking was confirmed to be due to entrapment of the fan-like part of the radial collateral ligament on a metacarpal head prominence arising from epiphysial thickening.
