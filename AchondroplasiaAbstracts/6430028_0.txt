Two autopsy cases of thanatophoric dysplasia in male newborn infant are described. They have markedly short-limbs and narrow thoraxes. Histologically, generalized disruption of endochondral ossification with normal resting cartilage was seen at the epiphyseal region of femur. Differential diagnosis from other 3 types of lethal chondrodysplasia is described and the histogenesis of thanatophoric dysplasia is considered with a survey of the literature.
