The mammalian mandibular condyle is composed of secondary cartilage and may thus be susceptible to genes causing achondroplasia and which result in abnormal++ primary cartilage formation. This paper describes the secondary cartilage in the mandible of the stumpy achondroplastic mutation in the mouse: both primary and secondary cartilage are affected by the gene.
