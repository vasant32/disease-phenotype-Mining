Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature with disproportionately short arms and legs. Anthopometrics and skeletal features are very similar to achondroplasia but milder. Seventy per cent of affected individuals are heterozygous for a mutation of the FGFR3 gene. Differences in some anthropometric measurements in affected patients with and without N540K mutation were analysed. Diagnosis of the disease was made on the presence of previously standardized criteria: short stature, short limbs and three or more X-ray features. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard procedures. PCR amplification of exons 10, 13 and 15 of FGFR3 was performed. Twenty-six patients were studied (median age was 7.31, range 0.27-20.0 years). Sitting height, body proportions and head circumference (HC) were statistically different in the mutated group. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out in order to estimate the discriminating power of different cut-off points of HC for recognizing patients with and without the mutation. A figure of 1.86 SD for HC was found to have a sensitivity of 73.3% and specificity of 100% for detecting HCH patients with the mutation. All of them had a HC greater than 1.86?SD. These results contribute to a better characterization of the clinical-molecular relationships in HCH.
