 THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the results of surgical short stature treatment with distraction osteogenesis using Ilizarov apparatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1996 sixteen patients were treated surgically because of short stature (11 male and 5 female) at the age of 9 to 29 years (mean 15.2). The cause of short stature in 6 patients was achondroplasia, 2 - Ellis van Creveld, 2 - Ollier disease, 1 - spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, 1 - hypothyroidism, 1 - pseudoachondroplasia and constitutional short stature - in other 3 patients. The pre-operative height ranged between 103 cm to 155 cm (mean 125). 12 patients were treated by the crossing method, means in one stage lengthening of the femur and the tibia of the contralateral limb. In 4 cases lengthening and improvement of body proportion was achieved by lower leg lengthening only (one of them lengthened twice). In 9 cases treated with the crossing method complete procedure was finished, in other 3 - only the first stage. Results In all patients the planed segmental lengthening was achieved except one tibial segment in the most older patient. Achieved height increase ranged from 8 to 20 cm (mean 13.8), on femur level 6 to 10 cm (mean 8.3) while on tibia level 2 to 10.5 cm (mean 7.3). The lengthening index for the single segment ranged from 0.6 to 4.7 months/cm (mean 1.5). COMPLICATIONS: Severe limitation of knee joint range of motion (up to 50 degrees) needs quadriceps plasty in one case. Residual valgus deformity of the tibia in one case with Ellis van Creveld needs corrective osteotomy. Abnormal bony re-generate of the tibia in the oldest patient did not allows achieving the planed lengthening and leads to increasing the lengthening index up to 3 times. CONCLUSION: Increasing the height with Ilizarov method is effective however the treatment time is long, requiring strict patients cooperation. The risk of complications should makes the qualification to this treatment careful and precise.
