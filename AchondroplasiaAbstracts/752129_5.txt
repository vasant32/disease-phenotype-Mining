The neurological complications of achondroplasia are discussed based on the literature and two of our cases. Thoracolumbar kyphosis, hypertrophic osteoarthritis, and intervertebral disc herniations may cause early neurological disturbances to adult achondroplasts owing to the spinal stenosis. The symptoms range from nerve root compression syndromes to complete transverse myelopathy. The radiographic features are characteristic, but the value of myelography for etiological clarification and location of the pathological process is limited. The significance of early symptoms and signs must be stressed and early decompression performed, as results are very disappointing once extensive neurological damage has occurred. An extensive laminectomy is usually indicated.
