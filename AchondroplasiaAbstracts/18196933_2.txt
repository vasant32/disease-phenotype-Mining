This paper describes a female infant with achondroplasia, Down syndrome and tetralogy of Fallot. Down syndrome and achondroplasia were confirmed by karyotyping and presence of a common fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 mutation (Gly380Arg), respectively. The clinical course was complicated by pulmonary hypoplasia and subsequent intractable respiratory failure secondary to the combination of congenital conditions, which resulted in the patient's death at 5 months.
