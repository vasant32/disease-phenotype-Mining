We report our experience of lengthening by over 30% a total of 117 lower limbs in achondroplastic patients. We have compared four methods: transverse osteotomy, oblique osteotomy, callotasis of the shaft and chondrodiatasis of the epiphysis. Chrondrodiatasis of the femur and callotasis of the tibia are the techniques which gave fewest complications.
