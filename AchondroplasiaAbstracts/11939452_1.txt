A 33-year-old achondroplastic female was scheduled to undergo vesico-vaginal fistula repair by the abdominoperineal route. Preoperative examination suggested a difficult airway so a combined spinal epidural technique was used. Subarachnoid block (sensory loss to T6) was established using 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 1 ml. Anaesthesia was prolonged with incremental doses of epidural bupivacaine 0.5% (total 10 ml) and postoperative analgesia was provided with epidural morphine boluses.
