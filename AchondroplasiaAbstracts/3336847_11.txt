A retrospective study was done to evaluate the results of surgical intervention on the neurological symptoms associated with achondroplastic dwarfs. Between 1971 and 1979, laminectomy was performed on three patients with thoracolumbar spinal canal stenosis associated with achondroplasia. Simultaneous spondylodesis using Harrington instrumentation in conjunction with extensive laminectomy was performed in the most recent case, and excellent results were obtained. We emphasize, therefore, that neurological deficit caused by kyphotic deformity and instability secondary to extensive laminectomy for achondroplasia can be prevented by this procedure, and thus good results can be anticipated.
