We describe a technique for slow, progressive, symmetrical distraction of the growth plate using a lightweight dynamic axial fixation system. Results are given for the elongation of 40 bony segments in children with limb-length discrepancies and 60 segments in children with achondroplasia or hypochondroplasia. Increases in limb length of up to 36% were obtained in non-achondroplastic and up to 64.5% in achondroplastic patients. There were no nerve or vascular lesions or bony infections and no case required a bone graft. Pin-track complications occurred in only 1.5%.
