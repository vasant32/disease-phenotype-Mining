We carried out an MRI study of the lumbar spine in 15 patients with achondroplasia to evaluate the degree of stenosis of the canal. They were divided into asymptomatic and symptomatic groups. We measured the sagittal canal diameter, the sagittal cord diameter, the interpedicular distance at the mid-pedicle level and the cross-sectional area of the canal and spinal cord at mid-body and mid-disc levels. The MRI findings showed that in achondroplasia there was a significant difference between the groups in the cross-sectional area of the body canal at the upper lumbar levels. Patients with a narrower canal are more likely to develop symptoms of spinal stenosis than others.
