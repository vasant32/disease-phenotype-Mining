Activating mutations within fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), a receptor tyrosine kinase, are responsible for human skeletal dysplasias including achondroplasia and the neonatal lethal syndromes thanatophoric dysplasia types I and II. Several of these same FGFR3 mutations have also been identified somatically in human cancers, including multiple myeloma, bladder carcinoma, and cervical cancer. The molecular pathways exploited by FGFR3 to stimulate abnormal proliferation during neoplasia are unclear. The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) has been shown previously to regulate apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Here we describe a novel interaction between FGFR3 and Pyk2, mediated by the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR3 and the kinase domain of Pyk2. Within the FGFR family, Pyk2 also interacted significantly with FGFR2. Overexpression of Pyk2 alone led to its spontaneous activation and tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in activation of Stat5B, indicated by the reporter GFP-Stat5B. These effects were completely dependent upon Tyr(402), the autophosphorylation site of Pyk2, which allows recruitment of Src family members for further activating phosphorylations at other sites on Pyk2. In the presence of activated FGFR3, the activation of Pyk2 itself became independent of Tyr(402), indicating that FGFR3 activation circumvents the requirement for c-Src recruitment at Tyr(402) of Pyk2. We also examined the role of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in antagonizing Pyk2 activation. Taken together, these results suggest that signaling pathways regulated by FGFR3 may converge with Pyk2-dependent pathways to provide maximal activation of Stat5B.
