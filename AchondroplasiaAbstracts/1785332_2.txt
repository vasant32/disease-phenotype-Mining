To evaluate the effect of human growth hormone (hGH) on the growth of children with achondroplasia, three patients with achondroplasia and one patient with hypochondroplasia were treated with 0.5 IU/kg/W of pituitary-extracted hGH for 6-12 months. Mean height velocity was significantly increased from 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 7.5 +/- 0.7 cm/year (P less than 0.05) by hGH. The tibial index, defined as the length/width ratio of left tibia, did not change during the treatment, indicating that hGH promotes growth without exaggeration of tubular bone deformity. Case 2, who had atlantoaxial dislocation, developed sleep apnea and neurological deficits during the second hGH treatment, but these were cured by operation. Thus, hGH therapy is effective in promoting growth in patients with achondroplasia, but the complication of atlantoaxial dislocation should be explored and corrected before the treatment.
