Hypochrondroplasia is an inherited skeletal dysplasia that resembles achondroplasia in mild degree. Radiographic manifestations encountered in 12 affected individuals in South Africa include slight shortening of all segments of the tubular bones, moderate caudal diminution of the lumbar interpedicular distances, increased lumbar lordosis with sacral tilt and distal prolongation of the fibula. Hypochondroplasia can be distinguished from other osteochondrodystrophies such as achondroplasia, pseudoachondroplasia and metaphyseal chondroplasia by the recognition of its clinical and radiographic manifestations.20
