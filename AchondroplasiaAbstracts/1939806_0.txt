Achondroplasia is a well-established and documented medical condition. Most of the diagnostic features are discernible from a clinical examination, which are complemented by radiographic findings of the bones of the skeleton. The findings from the hand-and-wrist radiograph of an affected Southern Chinese male infant, age thirty-nine-months, are reported. The findings from this case indicated an infrequently reported abnormality in the development of the hand in achondroplasia.
