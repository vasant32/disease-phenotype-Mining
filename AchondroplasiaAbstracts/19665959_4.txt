Limb deformities in children can be corrected using different techniques, notably external fixation following the Ilizarov principles. However, correction can be difficult in cases of multiple deformities. In 1994, Charles Taylor developed a new computer-assisted hexapodal external fixator system to treat these pathologies, the Taylor Spatial Frame. The objective of this study was to evaluate the results obtained with this technique in treating lower-limb deformities in children. Thirty-six patients were included in this prospective study, with a mean age of 11.1 years. The etiologies were distributed into six groups: congenital pathologies in 17 cases, fractures in five cases, post-traumatic pathologies in two cases, postinfectious sequelae in three cases, achondroplasia in three cases, and other causes in the last six cases. A total of 67 deformities in the three spatial planes were found in the entire group of patients. The procedure consisted of lengthening, correcting the axis, or both simultaneously. All the patients were managed with the same protocol: placement of an external fixator, AP and lateral X-rays, and planning of the correction using dedicated software. In this group of 36 patients, the fixator was worn for a mean 183 days; when lengthening was performed, a mean 4.3cm was gained with a healing index of 38.2 days/cm. Of the 67 initial deformities, 91% were corrected. The most frequently encountered complications were a superficial infection in 22.2% of the cases; one deep infection was also noted as well as three bone regenerate fractures. Use of this computer-assisted fixation system seems effective in treating complex deformities of the limbs in children, and allows treating several deformities simultaneously.
