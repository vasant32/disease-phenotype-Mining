Generalized shortening of fetal long bones detected from prenatal sonographic examination usually raise a tentative diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia. Information obtained from grey-scale scan is frequently not sufficient to provide a definite diagnosis, and the images are not readily comprehensible for the parents-to-be. Lately, three-dimensional sonography has become increasing available in obstetric practice. The authors report here a rare case of fetal achondrogenesis, which is a lethal form of skeletal dysplasia, in a 30-week-old fetus using real-time three-dimensional ultrasound. The prenatal findings of fetal achondrogenesis from this technique were thoroughly described, along with postnatal radiography and autopsy results. Sonographic features from this imaging technique allow for an accurate diagnosis and better understanding of the parents. This facilitates the genetic counseling process, as well as the parental options for further care.
