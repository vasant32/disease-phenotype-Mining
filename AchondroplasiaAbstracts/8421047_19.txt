We measured the extent and rate of new bone formation over an 18-month period before, during and after the lengthening of ten leg segments in six patients aged between 8 and 18 years, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). New bone formation could be identified within one week of the start of distraction. As lengthening proceeded, the bone density of the gap fell, reaching minimum values at the time of maximal distraction. Consolidation of the regenerating bone was started 1 to 2 weeks later in the tibia, and 2.5 to 3.0 weeks later in the femur. The rate of mineral accretion in new bone was significantly greater in the tibia than in the femur (16 +/- 1.86%/month, and 11 +/- 1.1%/month respectively; mean +/- SEM). There was significant osteoporosis distal to the osteotomy, more in the tibia than in the femur, particularly on the side of the fixator. The bone mineral density of the distal segment remained low at the time of fixator removal (44.2 +/- 5.58% and 61.0 +/- 4.2% of the control values at the tibia and femur respectively) and was only partially reversed by subsequent weight-bearing. We conclude that dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry provides an objective and quantitative assessment of new bone formation during leg lengthening. The technique also allows the measurement of the distraction gap and the assessment of leg alignment from the high-resolution images. Its use may decrease the requirements for conventional radiography.
