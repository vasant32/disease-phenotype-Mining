Leg lengthening procedures have developed rapidly in the last 20 years, especially distraction epiphyseolysis and corticotomy. We have used both methods since 1977 and carried out 22 distraction epiphyseolyses (20 patients) and 33 corticotomies (28 patients). The average lengthening distance was 8.25 cm and 7.8 cm respectively (minimum 4 cm, maximum 18 cm). The time per cm lengthening (lengthening index) was 45.8 days/cm for epiphyseolysis and 52.2 days/cm for corticotomy. The complication rates were similar in both methods (1.18 and 1.21 pro lengthening procedure). Both techniques are preferably performed by a well trained team of physicians, nurses and physiotherapists for correction of leg length discrepancies.
