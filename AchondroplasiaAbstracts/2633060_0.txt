The relationship between intracranial pressure and superior sagittal venous pressure has been often debated. On one side, the observation of patients with achondroplasia or hydrocephalus associated with craniostenosis suggest that the venous hyperpressure could be the cause of the enlarged ventricles; on the other side, reports have demonstrated that an increased superior sagittal venous pressure could be the consequence of increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the authors undertook a study to determine if there was a test that could distinguish between rare instances of increased superior sagittal venous pressure caused by structural and irreversible narrowing of the sinus, and those caused by increased intraranial pressure. This test is based on the study of venous pressure variation during cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal as compared to simultaneous intracranial pressure variations. The relationship between a sinus venous hyperpressure and an enlargement of the ventricles, the pathology of pericerebral collection occurring in such cases of hydrocephalus are discussed.
