Twenty-nine children underwent 36 Ilizarov procedures for a variety of limb deformities. We present the results in 11 patients, six with leg length discrepancies and five with achondroplasia, who underwent lengthening procedures using the Ilizarov method. Lengthening was accomplished in 15 of the 16 procedures (93%). Average increase in femur length was 10 cm (32%), in tibial length 7.5 cm (30%), in humerus length 11 cm (40%). Eleven complications occurred. The most common were pin tract infections (4), joint contractures (2), transient nerve injury (4), premature consolidation (5), and three fractures of the regenerated bone. The complication rate was as high as in other methods, but with the Ilizarov apparatus longer segments of bone were lengthened and more complex deformities were treated. The number of complications were lessened as experience was gained.
