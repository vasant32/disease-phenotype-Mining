Isolated, premature fusion of the frontosphenoidal suture is rare. This report describes an unusual combination of frontosphenoidal craniosynostosis and achondroplasia. Although craniosynostosis is known to occur in allelic conditions such as thanatophoric dysplasia, craniosynostosis in individuals with achondroplasia is exceedingly rare. Due to the distracting diagnosis of achondroplasia or inadequate knowledge of craniosynostosis, the abnormal head shape was initially treated by other physicians with helmet molding. Plastic surgery consultation was obtained at 2Â years of age and surgical care was provided. An acceptable head shape was obtained, but the delay in appropriate evaluation was disconcerting. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of isolated frontosphenoidal craniosynostosis associated with achondroplasia.
