Over the past three years, 36 anaesthetics were administered to 27 patients with achondroplastic dwarfism. Twenty-four patients underwent craniectomy for foramen magnum stenosis. Sixteen of the operations were undertaken in the sitting position with nine incidents of venous air embolism (VAE), all of which occurred in patients under 12 years of age. Six major complications occurred: two C-1 level spinal cord infarctions, two brachial plexus palsies, one severe macroglossia, and one accidental extubation. Intravenous access in the small child with achondroplastic dwarfism is made difficult because of the excess, lax skin and subcutaneous tissue. Airway management and laryngoscopy were not difficult and we found that endotracheal tube size was best predicted by the patient's weight and not age. Blood loss was 38 +/- 9 mg X kg-1 in the prone position (n = 8) and 18 +/- 4 mg X kg-1 in the sitting position (n = 16), and was related to the surgical procedure rather than to dwarfism. Our data indicate that complications are more likely to occur in the sitting position, and that these complications are of a serious nature, and every precaution should be taken to avoid their occurrence.
