Two test matings in the irish setter were performed, and genetic, clinical, morphometric, radiographic, bone histological and plasma and urine biochemical features of dwarfism were studied. All offspring were phenotypically normal at birth and weaning, but at the age of 2.5 to 4 months the longitudinal growth of the spine and leg bones was retarded in the dwarfs compared with the normal littermates. Most dwarfs performed well, even in the field. Radiographic and histological evaluations revealed a hypochondroplasia. A morphometric diagnostic method for Irish setter dwarfism was developed. A single autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was verified.
