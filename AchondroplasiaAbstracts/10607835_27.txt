Achondroplasia, the most common genetic form of human dwarfism, results from a point mutation (G380R) in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3). Heterozygotes for the mutation share disproportionate, proximal shortening of the limbs, mid-face hypoplasia and relative macrocephaly due to a failure in endochondral ossification. Here we have generated transgenic mice expressing the human mutant FGFR-3 under the transcriptional control of the mouse gene. Mice that are hemizygous for the mutant human gene display disproportionate dwarfism with skeletal phenotypes remarkably similar to those of human achondroplasia. Mice that are homozygous for the transgene suffer from a profound delay in skeletal development and die at birth, similar in that respect to humans homozygous for the achondroplasia mutant gene. Microscopic analysis of long bones demonstrates growth plate morphology compatible with that of human achondroplasia cases, sharing endochondral growth inhibition with restrained chondrocyte proliferation and maturation, penetration of ossification tufts and aberrant vascularization.
