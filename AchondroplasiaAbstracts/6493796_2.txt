Since Sir Ludwig Guttmann introduced the comprehensive modern clinical approach to the rehabilitation of spinal cord injured patients much experience has been accumulated. Modern spinal cord injuries centres have opened throughout the world, treating mainly acute spinal cord injuries in young patients. At Stoke Mandeville Hospital we have had the opportunity to treat several spinal patients who had suffered previous neurological or orthopaedic disorders. These complicated combinations affected the rehabilitation process and the presentations show clearly different aspects of the problem.
