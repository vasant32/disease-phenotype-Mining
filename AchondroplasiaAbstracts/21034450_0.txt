 INTRODUCTION: Achondroplasia is a musculoskeletal disorder associated with short stature. Despite an estimated prevalence of 1:25,000 in the general population, there is little literature concerning the diagnostic and treatment challenges faced by doctors dealing with a heart operation on a patient with this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 41-year-old Caucasian man of Greek ethnicity with achondroplasia, who underwent bypass heart surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The surgery was successful and did not present particular difficulties, showing that heart surgery can be safely performed on people with achondroplasia.
