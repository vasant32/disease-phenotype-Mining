Technological advances have greatly improved the management of the patient undergoing microlaryngeal surgery. The use of a laser, high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV), total intravenous anesthetic techniques (TIVA), and specially designed endotracheal tubes (Xomed Hunsaker Mon-Jet ventilation tube [Xomed Surgical Products, Jacksonville, FL]) are recognized as cutting edge approaches to the management of these cases. The use of high technology adjuncts requires considerable skill and knowledge from the perspective of the anesthesia provider. This case report describes an approach to anesthetic management for a patient with a history of achondroplastic dwarfism having laser excision of bilateral vocal cord granulomas. Further increasing the complexity of the case was the surgical use of an autogenous tissue glue, which required a period of 'airway silence' during the application process.
