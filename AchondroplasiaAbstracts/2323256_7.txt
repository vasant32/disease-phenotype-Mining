We have observed apneustic breathing in five patients with achondroplasia. In contrast to experimental models of apneusis, these patients appeared to have intact vagal function and no evidence of pontine disease. However, all our patients displayed clinical, structural, and electrophysiologic features of cervicomedullary compression, a well-recognized complication of achondroplasia. The degree of apneustic breathing was reduced in the majority of our patients following decompressive surgery. Traditional theories on the pathogenesis of apneustic breathing cannot satisfactorily explain the presence of apneustic breathing in our patients. We suggest that cervicomedullary compression may be capable of producing apneustic breathing in the absence of vagal or pneumotaxic center lesions.
