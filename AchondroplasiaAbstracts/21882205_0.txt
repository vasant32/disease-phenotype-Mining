Dyssegmental dysplasia is a rare, lethal, autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe camptomicromelia and anisospondyly. We describe the prenatal sonographic findings in an index case of the Rolland-Desbuquois type, with the diagnosis made by neonatal skeletal survey. Recognition of the unique vertebral disorganization may be used to prenatally distinguish dyssegmental dysplasia from other severe short-limbed conditions.
