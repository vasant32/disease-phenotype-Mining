The phenotypical characteristics in 20 children with achondroplasia were examined in relation to the occurrence of polyhydramnios. A history of polyhydramnios (9 of 20 cases) was associated with a lower height (SD) (P <.05), more severe shortening of the lower segment and upper limbs (P =.0001), and higher frequency of left-handedness (P =.0081).
