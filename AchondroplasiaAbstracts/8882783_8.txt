Standard curves developed for the general population cannot be used to assess the growth of an individual who has a condition that results in disproportionate short stature. For this reason, efforts have been made to develop growth curves specific for several of the chondrodysplasias. However, data concerning weight for height have been largely lacking, although they may be of particular importance for conditions such as achondroplasia, where there is some consensus that an increased prevalence of obesity is a particular problem. In this paper we provide standard weight for height curves for males and females with achondroplasia, and discuss the use of several indices which have been applied to the assessment of body fat in the general population.
