The present report deals with the description of craniofacial morphology and growth in an achondroplastic boy followed for a 10-year period. The methods included roentgencephalometry, and metallic implants were inserted in both jaws. Thereby it became possible to differentiate between displacement of the jaws and their bone remodelling. The study showed that in the patient analyzed the primary cause of the worsening of the sagittal jaw relationship was to be found in the growth disturbances of the cranial base rather than in the growth of the jaws per se.
