Several investigators have estimated the intracranial volume (ICV) in the past which indirectly reflects the brain volume. Most of these studies have been made on the dry skulls using linear dimensions, packing methods or occasionally radiological methods. It is also reported that the etiology of cerebellar tonsillar herniation is closely related to the size of the foramen magnum (FM). In the present study the ICVs have been estimated in 28 dry skulls using filling water method and the surface area of FMs were measured planimetry method. The estimated mean ICV was 1,311 +/- 133 cm. Surface area of FM was 760 +/- 144 mm. Antero-posterior and lateral direct roentgenograms of the skulls were also taken and the width, height and length (WHL) of the skull were measured by means of the cephalometry on radiograms. The relationship between the ICV, WHL and surface area of FM were analyzed statistically. The ICV, WHL and surface area of FM was correlated well (r = 0.271, P < 0.005; r = 0.265, P < 0.005, respectively) and a regression formula was proposed. Our results showed that skulls with larger ICV and WHL have larger FM surface area. We also suggested a regression formula that could be used to predict the surface area of FM regarding to the ICV and WHL values. In the next step, we took roentgenograms of skulls and obtain ICV measuring the width, length and height of skulls by means of cephalometry and investigate the relation between the findings of cephalometry and surface area of FM. The cephalometry could apply on living subjects and, thereby, our findings could provide some data to evaluate the etiology of Arnold Chiari malformation and achondroplasia for living subjects.
