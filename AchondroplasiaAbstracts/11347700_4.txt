The present study demonstrates that high-resolution radiostereometric analysis (RSA) can be used to assess global longitudinal compressive deformation across the callotasis zone during loading. In an achondroplastic patient operated with bifocal lengthening of the tibia by use of the Ilizarov external fixator, the axial compressive intersegmental strain in the proximal lengthening zone under a load of 71% of body weight was 7.7 mm. The proximal lengthening zone was 51.0 mm, and accordingly the overall linear strain across the callotasis was 15.1%. This large strain value found in distraction osteogenesis 6 weeks after end of distraction is not consistent with classical theory of the magnitude of micromotion needed for adequate stimulation of bone formation in fracture healing. The increased axial displacement did not stimulate bone healing and delayed union was observed. This one single observation does not allow for any conclusions to be drawn about the relationship of strain to fracture healing, but further and refined use of the RSA method will certainly improve our understanding of the role of axial strains in distraction osteogenesis.
