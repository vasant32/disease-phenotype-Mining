Pseudoachondroplasia is an autosomal dominant osteochondrodysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature, joint laxity, and early onset osteoarthrosis. Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by mutations in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). We looked for mutations in the COMP gene in three sporadic Chinese pseudoachondroplasia patients and identified two novel mutations, c.1189G>T (p.D397Y) and c.1220G>A (p.C407Y), and one recurrent mutation, c.1318G>C (p.G440R), in the calcium binding type III repeats of COMP. This study confirms the relationship between mutations of the COMP gene and clinical findings of pseudoachondroplasia; it also provides evidence for the importance of the calcium binding domains to the functioning of COMP.
