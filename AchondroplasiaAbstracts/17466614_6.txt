 INTRODUCTION: Achondroplasia (Ach), the most common form of short-limb short stature, and related disorders are caused by constitutively active point mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Recent studies have provided a large body of evidence for the role of the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in these disorders. Furthermore, a G380R mutation in FGFR3 (FGFR3(Ach)), which results in achondroplasia, induces apoptosis in the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5. This is associated with a decrease in the expression of PTHrP, which shares the same receptor with PTH, and it is significant that PTHrP rescues these cells from apoptosis. METHODS: Fetuses derived from transgenic mice expressing FGFR3(Ach) under the control of the type II collagen promoter (AchTG) or from wild-type mice were obtained on the 15th day of pregnancy. The femurs were collected from these specimens and cultured for 4 days with PTH. The effects of PTH treatment were then determined by morphometric and histological analyses, in situ hybridization of type X collagen mRNA, and the TUNEL assay. RESULTS: AchTG femurs showed suppressed growth compared with wild type (0.29+/-0.10 mm vs. 0.46+/-0.06 mm, respectively; p<0.05), particularly in cartilage. PTH treatments improved the growth velocity in the femurs of the AchTG (0.50+/-0.06 mm; p<0.01 vs. control). This was associated with the inhibition of both differentiation and apoptosis in chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PTH inhibits differentiation and apoptosis in chondrocytes and improves bone growth. These effects thus counterbalance the effects of FGFR3 mutations. PTH therefore is a potential therapeutic agent for achondroplasia.
