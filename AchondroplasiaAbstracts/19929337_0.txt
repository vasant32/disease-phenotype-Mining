Achondroplasia is associated with short pedicles that predispose individuals with this trait to develop symptomatic spinal canal stenosis. Laminoplasty is an excellent means of treating cervical myelopathy due to stenosis in selected individuals. Laminoplasty preserves segmental motion and stability, both of which are of benefit to all individuals. The authors report the successful surgical treatment of an achondroplastic adult woman with laminoplasty. This procedure alleviated her symptoms, and she was doing well at 2-year follow-up.
