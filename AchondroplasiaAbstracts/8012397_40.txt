Achondroplasia is the most common type of genetic dwarfism. It is characterized by disproportionate short stature and other skeletal anomalies resulting from a defect in the maturation of the chondrocytes in the growth plate of the cartilage. We have now mapped the achondroplasia gene near the telomere of the short arm of chromosome 4 (4p16.3), by family linkage studies using 14 pedigrees. A positive lod score of z = 3.35 with no recombinants was obtained with an intragenic marker for IDUA. This localization will facilitate the positional cloning of the disease gene.
