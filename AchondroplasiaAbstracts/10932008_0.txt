 OBJECTIVE: To study the gene mutation of Chinese patients with achondroplasia(ACH) and to set up a simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic dwarfism. METHODS: The specific fragment of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) transmembrane domain was amplified from dried blood spots of 21 patients with ACH and 6 suspicious patients with ACH by polymerase chain reaction, then mutation was screened and detected by restrictive enzyme analysis, single strand conformation polymorphism(SSCP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE). RESULTS: One out of 6 suspicious cases was ACH and 5 were pseudoachondroplasia(PSACH). Twenty-one out of 22 patients with ACH bore a G to A transition at nucleotide 1138 and 1 bore a G to C transversion at this same position. CONCLUSION: The nucleotide 1138 of FGFR3 gene is also the hotspot of mutation in Chinese patients with ACH. A simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method has been set up to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic dwarfism.
