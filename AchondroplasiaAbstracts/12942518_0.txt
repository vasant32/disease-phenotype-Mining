The fibular free flap is seen as one of the foremost technical options in mandibular reconstruction, especially in those defects where long bone is required. Cases with squamous-cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth with mandibular spread and subsequent segmentary mandibular removal are the cornerstone examples. A case of squamous-cell carcinoma of the whole floor of the mouth with mandibular invasion is reported. Radical resection of the floor of the mouth and bilateral mandibular horizontal ramus was performed, with a bony defect extending from angle to angle. The patient revealed an achondroplastic condition, with remarkable dwarfism and long-bone morphological alterations, that minimized the potential fibular length to transfer. A microsurgical reconstruction with an osteocutaneous fibular free flap was undertaken. The flap design was technically compromised by the forward bowing of the fibula and the ossification of the interosseous membrane. Specific intraoperative strategies for dealing with anatomic variations are discussed. The fibular free flap is an excellent technique for mandibular reconstruction. Morphological deviations can modify the design of the flap. Achondroplasia is not a deterrent in successful use of the free fibula flap for reconstruction of the head and neck in adequately selected cases.
