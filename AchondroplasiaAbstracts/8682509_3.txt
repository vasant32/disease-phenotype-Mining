Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism in humans. A recurrent glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 380 (G380R) of the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR-3) was identified in the majority of Western and Japanese patients, which is uncommon in other autosomal dominant genetic diseases. To determine whether this mutation is also common in Chinese patients, we examined the G380R mutation in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. Of ten patients studied, including eight sporadic cases and one family with two affected members, all have the same G380R mutation with a G-to-A transition. Our results support the argument that the G380R mutation of FGFR-3 is the most frequent mutation causing achondroplasia across different populations.
