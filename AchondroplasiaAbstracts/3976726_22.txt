Computerized tomographic dimensions of the foramen magnum of 63 achondroplastic individuals were compared to standards established for nonachondroplastic individuals. The size of the foramen magnum in patients with achondroplasia was small at all ages, particularly in those with serious neurologic problems. The data suggest that measurement of the foramen magnum may identify achondroplastic individuals at high risk of developing neurologic complications.
