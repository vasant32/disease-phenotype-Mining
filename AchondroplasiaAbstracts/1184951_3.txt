Thirty-one cases of a new hereditary chondrodystrophy in the rabbit have been shown to be associated with a fully penetrant autosomal recessive gene symbolized cd. The mutant is viable prenatally but does not survive after birth. It differs from the two other inherited chondrodystrophies, dachs and achondroplasia, but is very similar to the metatropic dwarf reported in man.
