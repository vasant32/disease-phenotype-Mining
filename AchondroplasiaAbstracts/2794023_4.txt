Three adolescent patients underwent limb lengthening for achondroplasia by the DeBastiani technique. Average increase in length was 15.4 cm (37.7%) per limb. Bone formation was excellent, and there were no neurovascular complications or infections. Numerous problems were encountered during treatment, but there were only two residual complications in one patient. Soft tissue tension and contractures precluded further lengthening in each case. Thirty-five percent lengthening may be the maximum that can be safely achieved for achondroplasia, and though it may produce cosmetic and psychological benefits, the functional benefits may not justify the expense, morbidity, and risk of the procedure.
