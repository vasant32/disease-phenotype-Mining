 PURPOSE: Prenatal diagnosis with ultrasound findings compatible with skeletal dysplasia due to FGFR3 mutations over a 9 year period in pregnancies and abortuses. METHODS: 54 samples were studied. Aneuploidy studies were carried out on all samples. By sequencing analysis, we determined mutations for achondroplasia (ACH), hypochondroplasia (HCH), and type I and type II tanathophoric dysplasia (TD). RESULTS: 2 chorionic villi samples had a G380R mutation due to a mother with ACH; 4 amniotic fluid samples with TDs in which the foetuses had micromelia plus hypoplastic thoraces; 5 samples from abortuses with TDs. Neither ACH nor HCH occurred in sporadic cases. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular studies in ongoing pregnancies are indicated in cases with an affected parent, a family history with positive molecular studies (maternal anxiety), and when the US finding demonstrates micromelia with a hypoplastic thorax. A protocol for tissues of abortuses should include an X-ray, pathologic anatomy, and genetic studies.
