Extensive limb lengthening may be indicated in achondroplastic patients who wish to achieve a height within the normal range for their population. However, increasing the magnitude of lengthening is associated with further complications particularly adjacent joint stiffness and fractures. We studied the relationship between the magnitude of femoral lengthening and callus pattern, adjacent joint stiffness and fracture of the regenerate bone in 40 femoral lengthenings in 20 achondroplastic patients. They were divided into two groups; group A had lengthening of less than 50% and group B of more than 50% of their initial femoral length. The patterns of radiological callus formation were classified according to shape, type and features. The incidence of callus features, knee stiffness and regenerate bone fracture were analysed in the two groups. Group B was associated with an increased incidence of concave, lateral and central callus shapes, adjacent joint and stiffness and fracture. Statistically, the incidence of stiffness in adjacent joints and regenerate bone fracture was significantly associated with the magnitude of lengthening. We suggest that careful radiological assessment of the patterns of callus formation is a useful method for the evaluation and monitoring of regenerate bone.
