 OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, safety and results of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) in ectopically located kidneys and in patients with musculoskeletal deformities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen such patients underwent PNL between June 2005 and May 2008. Mean stone size was 27.4 mm (16-37 mm). Six patients had severe kyphoscoliosis, 2 patients each had achondroplasia, cross-fused ectopia and pelvic ectopic kidney, and 1 patient had thoracic kidney. All had a preoperative CT scan of the abdomen. Preoperative ultrasound- or CT-guided percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) was done in 10 patients. Three patients underwent laparoscopic-assisted PNL. All underwent standard PNL. The stone-free rate, complication rate and need for secondary intervention were evaluated. RESULTS: PNL was successfully completed in all. A second ultrasound-guided intraoperative puncture was required in 2 patients. Re-look PNL was required in 1 patient and the same patient later required shock wave lithotripsy for complete stone clearance. The remaining 12 patients (92.3%) were rendered stone-free in a single sitting. CONCLUSION: PNL is a feasible and effective modality in anomalous kidneys. Preoperative planning with CT and image-guided PCN is helpful in these situations. Laparoscopic-assisted PNL can be safely performed in patients where access to a renal collecting system by fluoroscopy or image-guided assistance (ultrasound or CT scan) is not possible.
