There are more than 100 different types of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is the most common form of this rare condition. The incidence of achondroplasia in the United States is about 15 per 1 million births. Although inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, 80% of cases result from spontaneous mutation. Underdevelopment and premature ossification of bones result in characteristic craniofacial and spinal abnormalities. Limited neck extension, foramen magnum stenosis, a large tongue, large mandible, and atlanto-axial instability can lead to increased difficulty of airway management. Severe kyphosis, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, and unpredictable spread of local anesthetics in the epidural space and subarachnoid space lead to reluctance to apply regional anesthesia in this patient group. In addition, pregnancy in a person with achondroplasis poses more problems for anesthetic selection. These problems include potential hypoxia, severely decreased functional residual capacity, risk of gastric aspiration, and supine hypotension. In this case report, we describe the anesthetic management of an achondroplastic dwarf who underwent cesarean delivery.
