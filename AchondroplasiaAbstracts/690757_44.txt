Standard growth curves for achondroplasia, the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, have been constructed based on measurements of height, growth velocity, upper and lower segment, and head circumference in 400 achondroplastic dwarfs. These standard curves provide the basis to assess normal growth in these individuals, to aid in the determination of superimposed disorders, and to assess any growth accelerating therapy.
