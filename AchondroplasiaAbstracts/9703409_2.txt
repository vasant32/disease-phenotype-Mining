We investigated the relation between callus diameter during bone distraction and the occurrence of late fracture and deformity. We retrospectively reviewed 28 tibial lengthenings in 14 patients with achondroplasia. The minimal diameter of the lengthened zone was measured on radiographs, when the sliding mechanism of the lengthening device was released, and the callus diameter ratio in two planes (CDR; diameter of the callus/diameter of the tibia at the level of the osteotomy end) was calculated. The CDR correlated negatively with the distracted length. Late fracture or late angular deformity occurred in 6 of the 28 lengthenings. When the CDR was 85% or more in both planes, these complications did not occur, but when the CDR was 80% or less in either plane, they occurred in 6 of 20 bones. Careful attention should therefore be given not only to the continuity of the callus but also to its diameter.
