We present a case of aortic valve replacement combined with aortic root enlargement, performed on an achondroplastic dwarf with severe calcific aortic stenosis. There are no data about the incidence of valvular diseases in achondroplastic patients. To our knowledge, this is the 1st time that an aortic valve replacement associated with an aortic root enlarging procedure has been performed in this kind of patient. The aim of this report is to show that achondroplasia, in and of itself, is not a contraindication to aortic valve replacement.
