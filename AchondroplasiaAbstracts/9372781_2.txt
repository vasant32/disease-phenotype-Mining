Ten years of experience in lower limb lengthening achieved in 35 patients with achondroplasia and seven patients with hypochondroplasia is reported. A uniform method of callus distraction (callotasis) was used in all cases, although the order of lengthening of each bone differed among the cases. The mean age of the patients at the time of first operation was 14.5 years; at followup, the mean age was 18.8 years. The mean lengthening achieved in the femur was 7.2 cm (range, 4.5-12 cm) and in the tibia 7.1 cm (range, 4.5-13 cm). More lengthening was achieved in the more recent cases. The function of lengthened limbs, evaluated by physical strength tests, was better at followup than before lengthening in the growing children, although the mechanical axes of the lengthened bones were not necessarily in correct alignment.
