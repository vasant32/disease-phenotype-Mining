An alignment grid is described which may used peroperatively in combination with a mobile image intensifier to accurately reduce long bone fractures or correct bony deformities. The device has been evaluated in use in over 50 patients. It has enabled reductions and corrections to be achieved with alignment accuracies of the order of two to three degrees form neutral. The device is cheap to manufacture and quick to use. It produces significant savings in operating time, radiation exposure to staff and revenue costs of X-ray film. The idea has now been extended to include assessments of the mechanical axis of the limb and limb length in complex limb reconstruction cases.
