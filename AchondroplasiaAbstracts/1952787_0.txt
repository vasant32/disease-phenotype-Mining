The authors report a premature achondroplastic child with connatal neuroblastoma. Though this association could be coincidental, we suggest that a microdeletion inducing a contiguous gene syndrome involving the locus of neuroblastoma suppressor gene could be an alternative hypothesis. The gives a working hypothesis for the localization of the gene for achondroplasia.
