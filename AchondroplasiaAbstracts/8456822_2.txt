Characteristic temporal bone changes have recently been defined by high resolution CT in nine patients with achondroplasia (Cobb et al., Am J Neuroradiol 9:1195, 1988). These included narrowing of the skull base and "towering" petrous ridges resulting in abnormal orientation of the inner and middle ear structures. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. All had a history of frequent otitis media and four had experienced tympanic membrane tube insertion. Three patients had significant sensorineural hearing loss, two had conductive hearing loss and one patient had combined hearing loss. None of the temporal bone morphologic changes were found to be correlated with the degree of either sensorineural or conductive hearing loss. Fusion of the ossicular chain was not present in any of our cases. Appropriate treatment of frequent acute otitis media and early awareness of middle ear effusions and conductive hearing loss in children with achondroplasia may be of great importance in preventing permanent hearing loss.
