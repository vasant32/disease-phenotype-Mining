Transient kyphotic deformity arises in most infants with achondroplasia. In a minority, a fixed and angular kyphosis develops, which can cause serious neurologic sequelae later in life. We assessed a protocol for preventing development of such fixed kyphosis in a sequential, unselected series of 66 infants with achondroplasia. This study demonstrates the efficacy of early prohibition of unsupported sitting and, in those in whom such prohibition proves insufficient, use of bracing. When the proposed algorithm was followed, none of the infants had development of a progressive kyphotic deformity. On this basis, it appears that the secondary risks of angular kyphosis, previously estimated to be between 10 and 15% in individuals with achondroplasia, can be completely eliminated.
