Skeletal dysplasia are a relatively common and distinct group of genetic disorders. Even though abnormalities of bone growth are the major clinical manifestations, the pathological process may involve in any body system. Many of these disorders have dire consequences such as neonatal death and most will have life-long physical and psychosocial morbidity associated with them. Recent advances in genetic research have identified the genes underlying the primary defects in several common skeletal dysplasias such as achondroplasia and diastrophic dysplasia. While these advances are clearly important in developing better therapy and a cure for those conditions, the role of the pediatrician as the diagnostician has remained unchanged. In this article we describe how a systematic approach using the simplest of tools--clinical assessment and radiograph--can arrive at a diagnosis in most instances of newborns with skeletal dysplasias. The key features that are essential for establishing a diagnosis for most of the entities encountered in the newborn are described along with our general approach to the evaluation of the radiographs.
