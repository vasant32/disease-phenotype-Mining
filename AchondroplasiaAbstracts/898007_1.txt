The neurological manifestations of achondroplasia include megalencephaly, hydrocephalus, and progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy secondary to spinal stenosis. Subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage have not been previously reported in association with achondroplastic dwarfism. This report describes two patients with achondroplasia who have died secondary to intracranial hemorrhage. At autopsy, the source of hemorrhage was found to be an arteriovenous malformation of the choroid plexus in one case and a ruptured aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery in the other.
