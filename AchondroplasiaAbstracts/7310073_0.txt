A case of brachymesophalangy in which ossicles related to metacarpal heads became detached, causing joint locking, is presented. A distinction has been made by arthrography between this lesion and the loose bodies seen in osteochondritis dissecans, which were previously thought to be the origin of the ossicles and the cause of the locking.
