 OBJECTIVE: To study the two-axis parallel method in bone lengthening. METHODS: Among 54 patients (male 28, female 26, mean age 22) who performed tibial lengthening by metaphyseal osteotomy using two-axis parallel method, 26 patients were poliomyelitis sequelae, 13 patients were inequality in limb length after trauma, 4 patients were achondroplasia, 6 patients were genetic short stature, 1 patient was maculatum disease complicated with leg length discrepancy, 4 patients were pituitary dwarfism. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up and the duration ranged from 18 months to 45 months, with an average of 24.5 months. All patients had bone lengthened. The maximum increase of limb length was 12 cm and the minimum increase was 5 cm, averaged 6.2 cm. One patient had foot drop, 2 patients had foot drop complicated with strephexopodia, 1 patient had serious pinhole infection, and 1 patient had delayed union of the bone. CONCLUSION: The two-axis parallel method tibial lengthening by metaphyseal osteotomy can reduce postoperative complications and simplify the operative procedure, which is an ideal method for bone lengthening.
