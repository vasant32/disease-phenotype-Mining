 INTRODUCTION: Contracture is a condition of abnormal shortening or shrinkage of a muscle, and or a tendon often with persistent flexion or distortion at a joint. Careful documentation of the kind of contractures encountered in different paediatric disorders is important in distinguishing a specific subtype. Achondroplasia has been considered as the most common short-limbed dwarfism syndrome, but there are a variety of other syndromes within this category, and other types of limb shortening. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 5-year-old boy of Austrian origin who manifests progressive joint limitations in connection with a dysplastic form of short-limbed dwarfism namely chondrodysplasia punctata-tibial-metacarpal-type. Progressive joint limitations of maximal intensity over the hip, and the ankle joints were the main presenting features. CONCLUSION: Osteochondrodysplasias involve abnormal bone or cartilage growth leading to skeletal maldevelopment, often short-limbed dwarfism. Diagnosis is by physical examination, radiographic documentation, and, in some cases, genetic testing. In patients with chondrodysplasia punctata, early life radiographic examination is fundamental, since resolution of the punctate calcifications leaving abnormal epiphyses and flared and irregular metaphyses after age one to three years seems to be characteristic.
