We report the anaesthetic management of two achondroplastic patients who presented for emergency cesarean section. Regional anaesthesia could not be done in both cases as a result of technical difficulties and general anaesthesia was performed. Airway management was done with two different techniques following airway assessment. The perioperative periods were uneventful. We discuss the anaesthetic implications and problems associated with regional and general anaesthesia in achondroplastic parturients. The controversies in the anesthetic management of these patients are also highlighted.
