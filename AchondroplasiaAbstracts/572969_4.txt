Azodrin was applied to adult embryo chickens, Chukar Partridge, and Bobwhite Quail. Chronic exposure of adult birds to Azodrin mixed in their feed indicated that no a priori predictions could be made about one species based on the results of another; each had a different no effect (MACT) level. The chickens were between 25 and 100 ppm, the Chukar Partridge 5 and 25 ppm, and the Bobwhite quail less than 1.25 ppm. The chicken adults were most resistant, and the quail were least resistant to chronic exposure to Azodrin. Yolk-injected Azodrin caused the embryos of all three species to develop abnormally. The chicken and Chukar embryos developed a generalized achondroplasia, the quail were amuscular, only. In general, the 3 day quail embryos were most resistant to injected Azodrin and the chicken embryo least resistant. The relationship between adult and embryo response was negative.
