We report a 16-year-old boy who had all the typical manifestations of achondroplasia but also had a skeletal and dental class III malocclusion, a narrow maxilla, macroglossia and an open bite between the posterior teeth. The narrow maxilla and bilateral cross-bite were treated with rapid palatal expansion. The open bite and irregular teeth were corrected with fixed orthodontic treatment, taking account of the macroglossia. This case is of clinical interest since dental class III malocclusion, posterior open bite, macroglossia and benign migratory glossitis have not previously been reported in achondroplasia.
