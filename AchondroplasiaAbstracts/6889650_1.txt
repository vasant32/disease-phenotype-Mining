Five cases and a review of the literature concerning achondroplasia and pregnancy are described. Cephalopelvic disproportion secondary to marked pelvic contracture is the most consistent feature. Preeclampsia is more frequent but usually did not become a major problem regarding obstetric management. Polyhydramnios may indicate a poor prognosis for the fetus. Dyspnea on exertion and at rest is quite variable and may be related to associated vertebral column deformities. Fetal wastage and neonatal death are increased.
