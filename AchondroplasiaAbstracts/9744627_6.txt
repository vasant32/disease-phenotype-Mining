Intracranial arachnoid cysts are benign development anomalies that may be clinically asymptomatic. The authors describe 30 children with intracranial arachnoid cysts in terms of clinical manifestations and relations to the associated brain anomalies or lesions. The mean age at onset of clinical manifestations was 4 years, 7 months (range 1 day to 14 years). The mean age at diagnosis was 6 years, 2 months (range 10 days to 16 years). Most patients with nonprogressive symptoms, such as seizures and headache, had focal epileptiform discharges on electroencephalogram, and they benefited from antiepileptic drugs. Surgery resulted in only partial reduction in both cyst size and seizure frequency in patients with intractable seizures, and it also failed to improve some neurologic signs, such as sexual precocity or cranial neuropathy resulting from long-term compression of arachnoid cysts. We conclude that the only absolute indication for surgery is the presence of progressive hydrocephalus or intracranial hypertension. The associated anomalies or lesions include brain tumors, giant nevocellular nevi, achondroplasia, microphthalmia, intracystic hemorrhage, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, and heterotopia.
