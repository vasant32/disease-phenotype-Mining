Genu varum is a common manifestation of achondroplasia. In the pediatric population, determination of the appropriate corrective osteotomy can be challenging because of a large cartilage envelope. To determine whether osteotomy based on radiographs alone corresponded to osteotomy based on arthrography and radiography, we retrospectively studied 41 patients (75 limbs) and identified the appropriate osteotomy based on (i) radiographs alone and (ii) radiographs and arthrography. We found that the osteotomy choice changed in 45 limbs (60.8%) overall and in 34 limbs (94.44%) of patients aged below 8 years.
