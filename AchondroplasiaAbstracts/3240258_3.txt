The authors analyze the achondroplastic lumbar spine in the pre-puberal and post-puberal periods until adulthood by means of standard X-rays, CT scan, MRI, and myelography. The small spinal canal in achondroplasts must be considered the result of developmental and congenital conditions. Orthopaedic and surgical possibilities are reviewed with the goal of reducing to a minimum the developmental factors.
