We present a prospective study of the results of periosteal stripping and division in 10 achondroplastic children. A single limb (femur and tibia) was operated on and the change in actual length of each bone and the percentage change in growth compared to that of the non-operated limb was measured by scanogram. The mean absolute increase in growth was small, measuring 3 mm for the femur and 2 mm for the tibia. There was no measurable growth difference after 18 months. This method of increasing limb length in achondroplastic children prior to definitive and extensive lengthening procedures is not recommended.
