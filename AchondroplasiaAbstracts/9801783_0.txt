We retrospectively reviewed nine tibial lengthenings in seven achondroplastic patients. The callotasis method was used, and a unilateral type lengthener, either the Dynamic Axial Fixator (Orthofix, Italy; eight legs) or the High Functional Fixator (Matsumoto Co., Japan; one leg), was applied. The distracted length averaged 14.6 (range 10-18) cm. The minimum diameter of the callus was measured using a ruler on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. The callus diameter ratio (%) was calculated as the callus diameter divided by the original diaphysis diameter. For periods during axial loading and after removal of the fixator in each patient, a single regression line was drawn on the callus diameter ratio data using the least squares method, and the diameter change rate (%/day) was evaluated by inclination of this line. The diameter change rates during axial loading were negative in six legs, but those after fixator removal were positive in all legs, and the latter were significantly greater than the former. The diameter change rates after fixator removal on the anteroposterior radiographs were negatively correlated with the callus diameter ratio at the time of fixator removal (r = 0.84, P = 0.0008). Simple axial loading may not be a sufficient mechanial environment for restoration of the physiological shape, and it is important to be aware that we cannot expect the callus diameter to increase by this means alone.
