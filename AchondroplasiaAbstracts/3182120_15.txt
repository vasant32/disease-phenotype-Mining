In achondroplasts limb lengthening can restore the normal proportion of the body. The Ilizarov method of limb lengthening has been used in 37 patients, 23 of whom have had an adequate follow-up after operation. In this technique the cortex of the bone is partially cut, leaving the medulla intact; the two bone segments are then subjected to distraction by means of a special apparatus. The bone tissue between the two segments starts regenerating and this allows a considerable increase in length. The results and complications are reported. It is considered that this method is based on sound principles and is free of major risks.
