A bas-relief of the temple of Deir el-Bahari, Luxor, Egypt, discovered in 1867 by Mariette, shows a queen (Queen of Pount) with wide cutaneous folds on arms, abdomen and legs, hyperlordosis, a steatopygia and abnormally short lower limbs. Various assumptions about the diagnosis (steatopygia, partial achondroplasia, neurofibromatosis) were proposed at the beginning of the XXth century, neither taking into account all morphological abnormalities of the queen. We propose a novel hypothesis taking into account all signs: a Cutis Laxa.
