The investigation was carried out on 12 cows and their calves. At the time of 3 months before parturition and 7 days after parturition metabolic alkalosis one provoked with the high protein feed. The laboratory investigations dependent of determinations on the rumen content the pH, NH3, volatile fatty, acids, the protozoa, bacteria, total gas CO2 and CH4. On the arterial and venous blood on determination the pH, BE, sO2, pO2, HCO3 and coefficient of consumption of the oxygen, and on the venous blood the levels of Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, total proteins, albumins and globulins, cholesterol, glucose, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and urea. In the colostrum and in milk one determined the pH, potential acidosis--degree SH, proper weight, proteins, dried mas of milk, time of coagulation in the presence of rennin, Na, K, Ca, Cl, total fats and their composition with different fatty acids. No existed truly changes of clinical signs, only feces was sickly. The metabolic alkalosis of cows decreased the consumption of oxygen across the tissue, deficient of the energy, disorders of water-electrolyte and acid-base balances. The calves form cows with metabolic alkalosis delivered also with metabolic alkalosis, with the symptoms of achondroplasia and degeneration of the liver and other organs. Metabolic alkalosis of cows influenced on the quality of colostrum and milk. The colostrum gained from cows with alkalosis caused of disturbance of gastrointestinal tract and diarrhea presence.
