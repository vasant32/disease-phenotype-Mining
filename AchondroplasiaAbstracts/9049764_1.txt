We have reviewed 28 tibial lengthenings in 14 patients with achondroplasia at an average age of 15 years, and compared the effectiveness of physiotherapy and an orthosis in preventing an equinus deformity. Physiotherapy of 15 min a day was ineffective even when the patients were able to walk. An orthosis worn for 16 h a day prevented equinus deformity up to at least 50% of lengthening, and the difference from physiotherapy was significant at more than 30% of lengthening.
