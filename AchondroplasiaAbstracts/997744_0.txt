More than 70 transverse lesion of the cord syndromes in chondrodystrophic dwarfs have been described in the literature. 43 of these were adequately described and/or accessible for the authors. In 22 cases, a mechanical cause (including 14 lesions of the intervertebral disk) was directly responsible and, in 14 cases, no direct spinal cord suppression was found. In the latter group, 10 had a negative myelography, 3 positive and 1 case myelography was not performed. Of the 12 laminectomized cases, only 3 made a good recovery, 4 showed severe deterioration and 2 conservatively treated cases (including the case described here) were clearly improved. Of the 16 laminectomized cases with limited mechanical impediment, 8 showed good results, 3 indifferent and 5 unknown. The cause of the vascular myleopathy was assumed to be a combination of the narrowness of the bony vertebral canal and an increasing kyphotic process. The authors suggest that laminectomy for tranverse lesion of the cord syndrome in dwarfs should be made only after several controls and an established stop correlating with the location of the neurological lesions. We reject decompression laminectomy for vascular myleopathy because of the already endangered vascular situation and the poor results. We prefer orthopedic measures.
