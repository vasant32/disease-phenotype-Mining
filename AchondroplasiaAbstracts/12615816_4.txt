 BACKGROUND: We report the first attempts at preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and IVF and their accompanying difficulties for achondroplasia (ACH) patients. METHODS: A PGD test was developed using fluorescent single cell PCR on lymphoblasts from patients and controls and from blastomeres from surplus IVF embryos. A specific digestion control based on the use of two fluorochromes was elaborated. Ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval were carried out using conventional protocols. RESULTS: We performed 88 single cell tests for which amplification was obtained in 86 (97.7%) single lymphoblasts. Allele drop out (ADO) was observed in two out of 53 (3.7%) heterozygous lymphoblasts. If we combine the results from the blastomere testing from surplus embryos with those from PGD cycles and re-analysis after PGD, we obtained a PCR signal in 84% of cases of which 91% were correctly diagnosed at the G380 locus. A total of six cycles were performed resulting in three embryo transfers. We observed difficulties in ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval with affected female patients. No pregnancy was obtained. CONCLUSION: A PGD test for ACH is now available at our centre but our initial practice raises questions on the feasibility of such a test, specially with affected female patients.
