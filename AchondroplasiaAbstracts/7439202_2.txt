Fibroblasts from a case of achondrogenesis type II and fibroblasts from a normal control donor were subcultivated in vitro in parallel. The lipid study on these cells showed similar total lipid content, free cholesterol level, phospholipid distribution and fatty acid patterns, while neutral glycerides were slightly more elevated in the control fibroblasts. The histological finding of Laxova et al. (1973) could not be confirmed.
