The term Lethal Neonatal Dwarfism (Death Dwarfism) denotes bone dysplasias which always have a fatal outcome. Three different cases of "new" forms of death dwarfism are reported. A babygram should be a routine examination in all the cases of stillborn babies or those who die soon after the birth. If then the diagnosis cannot be established microscopic investigations of the growth cartilage should be performed.
