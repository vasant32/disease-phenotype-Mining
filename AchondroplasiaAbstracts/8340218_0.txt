Body image disturbance was studied in 6 achondroplastic children before and after surgical leg elongation (Wagner's procedure) using Fisher's Draw-a-Person Test and the Body Cathexis Test, as well as on another group of 6 achondroplastic children who had undergone the same procedure several years earlier. These groups were compared with 12 healthy control children. Gross disturbance of body image was present before the operation with a substantial improvement after the procedure. However, even years after the surgical procedure there still exists a difference in body image between the control-normal group and achondroplastic adolescents.
