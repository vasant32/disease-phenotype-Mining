Two cases of skeleton malformations found by ultrasonic diagnostics are described. One was osteogenesis imperfecta and other achondroplasia. The possibility of malformation was postulated in 36th gestation week in the first case, and in 37th gestation week in the second. The authors discuss on malformations and their early diagnosis.
