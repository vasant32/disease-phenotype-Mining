Evaluation of 32 individuals with achondroplasia revealed that 28% had a history of apnea and 22% had respiratory abnormalities on polysomnography. In those patients requiring posterior fossa decompressive surgery, improvement was noted in follow-up polysomnograms. Multimodality studies suggested that brainstem compression was common in achondroplasia and could account in part for the abnormal respiratory function in this disorder, including obstructive apnea, central apnea, and hypoxemia.
