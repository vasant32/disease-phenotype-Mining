Ultrastruct of cartilage were examined in Marfan syndrome, Menkes kinky hair syndrome, achondroplasia, asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia, mild diastrophic dysplasia and mucopolysaccharidoses I and III. Ruthenium red staining revealed decrease of proteoglycans in cases with Marfan syndrome and kinky hair syndrome, and increase in cases with osteochondrodysplasia and mucopolysaccharidosis III. This morphologic tendency coincided with the result obtained by biochemical analysis of glycosaminoglycan contents in cartilage matrix from cases with Marfan syndrome (decreased content) and asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (increased content). It was postulated that proteoglycan content in cartilage matrix might be related to excessive or reduced skeletal growth in Marfan syndrome or osteochondrodysplasia.
