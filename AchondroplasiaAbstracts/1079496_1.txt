This paper reports on an 18-month-old achondroplastic child with dilated lateral ventricles.  Results of a cisternographic investigation were normal.  No shunting procedure was carried out, and subsequent clinical progress was satisfactory.  Some patho-physiological aspects of achondroplastic dysgenesis are discussed.
