The chondrodystrophic mouse mutant stumpy (stm) shortens proximal limb bones more than distal ones and acts late in development (circa 14 days post partum). It was thought that a late disturbance in bone growth might cause more damage to epiphyses of proximal than distal bones. This was investigated using a single injection of papain on days 8, 10 and 12: shortening of proximal and distal bones was demonstrated, but was similar in all three experimental groups.
