The effect of lower limb lengthening on nerve conduction was investigated in 5 achondroplastic subjects who underwent callotasis on a "cross-over" basis. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and F waves from the posterior tibial nerve (PTN) were studied preoperatively and then after removal of the axial fixators. SEPs at the end of lengthening showed that both the latency of the plexus potential (P9) and, albeit to a lesser extent, the interpeak time between the plexus and the spinal cord (N15) potentials were significantly increased. The central conduction time (N15-P33) and the amplitude of the scalp responses were not modified. The latencies of the F waves were much longer at the end of bone distraction than in basal conditions. The increases in both PTN SEPs and F-wave latencies are consistent with a slowing of conduction The extent of these latency shifts correlated closely with the degree of limb lengthening. We calculated that, on average, each cm of lengthening could produce 0.21 msec and 0.22 msec delays respectively, suggesting a similar effect of the stretching on both sensory and motor fibers. Our findings indicated that the damage could be widely distributed along the whole length of the nerve, affecting both the peripheral (trunk) and proximal (plexus and root) segments. The electrophysiological changes were not associated with any persistent clinical complaint.
