Tibial lengthening by slow distraction of the distal epiphysis using the dynamic axial fixator was performed in 3 patients near to skeletal maturity, in 2 patients with congenital origin and in one with achondroplasia. The obtained lengths were 4.4 cm (17% of the tibial length), 3.7 cm (12%) and 3.6 cm (19%). There were no serious complications. Bone formation at the site of distraction was thought to be periosteal in origin when assessed using X-rays and computerized tomography. There was no radiological evidence that bone at the distracted sites was formed by an apposition from the metaphyseal side which is expected in cases of stimulation of endochondral ossification in the growth plate. There was no further measurable growth at the distracted growth plates after lengthening. This method is useful for limb lengthening near the time of epiphyseal closure.
