A client with hypochondroplasia dwarfism and a medical diagnosis of spinal stenosis had found that her ability to walk had decreased over the past 7 years from easily walking 6 miles (10 K) to now needing to rest every half block (171 ft/52 m) due to muscle fatigue. Such weakness is consistent with nerve impingement due to spinal stenosis, which would not be improved by massage. However, during a preliminary assessment, it was found that both lower legs had severe fascial adhesions, possibly compressing lower leg blood vessels and nerves. It was hoped that by using myofascial massage techniques to relieve the adhesions, her mobility would improve over the course of 8 sessions. Myofascial massage techniques showed positive results in reducing adhesions, improving circulation, and increasing the distance the client could walk before resting to 2 blocks (686 ft/209 m). Working with this client showed that Licensed Massage Practitioners (LMPs) can easily accommodate clients of very short height.
