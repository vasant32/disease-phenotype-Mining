Achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia are the most common forms of short stature. The leading sign is the diminished body height. Most cases of achondroplasia can be detected by clinical examination. Hypochondroplasia is more often not diagnosed until preschool age.In achondroplasia many different orthopaedic problems can arise, which influence the ADL. Mainly pathologic alterations of the occipitocervical region or a stenosis of the medullary cavity should be expected. In the limbs a bow-leg deformity and hyperlaxity of the ligaments often can be seen, which in some cases restrict walking capacity. Even if many people of short stature contemplate a lengthening procedure, the correction of deformities is much more important. The CORA method should be used in planning any osteotomy.
