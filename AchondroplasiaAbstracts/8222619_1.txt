A menu-drive PC program, ZDIST, for computing the distances between the estimated polynomial growth curves of subjects who have been followed longitudinally is described, illustrated, and made available to interested readers. These distances can be computed on the basis of the individual growth curves themselves and/or from estimates of individuals' growth velocity and acceleration curves. The resulting distance matrices can be saved in ASCII format and subsequently imported into any clustering program which accepts this type of input, e.g. SYSTAT.
