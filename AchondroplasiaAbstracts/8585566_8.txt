The occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is achondroplasia has been linked to brain stem compression. Overnight sleep studies (11 subjects) and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP's, 10 subjects) were recorded before and after conventional treatment of OSA in achondroplasia. The two groups were derived from 30 subjects who underwent diagnostic sleep studies and SEPs, including 15 females and 15 males with a median age 6.6 years (range 1.0-47.6) at the time of the first study. In 30 initial studies there was no correlation between severity of OSA and abnormalities on SEP evaluation. Treatment of 17 subjects included adenotonsillectomy (n = 3), weight loss (n = 1), and nasal-mask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (n = 13). Sleep studies in 11 subjects after a delay of 8.8 +/- 2.8 months showed a reduction in respiratory disturbance index (RDI) from 38.4 +/- 6.9 to 6.5 +/- 1.8 events hr(-1) (p < 0.001) and movements/arousals fell from 10.4 +/- 2.2 to 4.8 +/- 0.2 hr(-1) (p < 0.04). Obstructive events were reduced from 33.7 +/- 6.9 to 2.4 +/- 1.0 hr(-1) (p < 0.001). Improvement of respiratory indices was associated with an increased proportion of slow-wave sleep from 25.2 +/- 4.0% to 32.3 +/- 2.4% (p = 0.01), and decrease in stage 1-2 sleep from 59.3 +/- 5.8% to 46.6 +/- 1.9% (p = 0.03). There was no increase in the percentage of REM sleep (15.2 to 21.2%). Repeat SEP studies in 10 subjects, after clinically effective treatment of OSA, showed improvement of SEP score of at least 1 grade, in 5 of 7 (71%) with initially abnormal values. We conclude that treatment of relieve upper airway obstruction improves OSA in achondroplasia, accompanied by changes in sleep structure and, in some cases, improved studies of neurological function.
