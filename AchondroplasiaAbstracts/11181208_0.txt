AIM: To determine through the measurement of different angles the correction of lumbar hyperlordosis after bilateral femoral lengthening using the Icatme technique and to assess the absence of neurological symptomatology secondary to stenosis of the lumbar canal after femoral lengthening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with achondroplasia were studied. Mean age was 22.3 years. The patients underwent femoral lengthening using the Icatme technique. X rays of the lateral rachis taken before and after lengthening were used to measure a series of angles. RESULTS: The lumbar lordosis angle, Sez's angle and the L5S1 angle decreased while the lumbosacral angle, Jungham's angle and the sacrum angle increased, leading to correction of lumbar hyperlordosis, verticalization of the sacrum and improvement in thoracolumbar and lumbosacral inflection. Values were similar to the standard for individuals without achondroplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral lengthening using the Icatme technique in achondroplastics modifies the statics of the lumbar spine, making them similar to those of nonachondroplastics. The procedure corrects lumbar hyperlordosis and prevents the appearance of neurological symptomatology due to stenosis of the lumbar canal. The incidence of neurological complications due to stenosis of the lumbar canal in achondroplastics who have undergone femoral lengthening is low compared with that of achondroplastics of the same age and sex who have not undergone this procedure.
