OBJECTIVE: A subgroup of patients with pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) have been found to harbor mutations within the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene. These two diseases are autosomal dominant disorders that are characterized by an early onset of osteoarthritis (OA). The COMP gene is expressed primarily in chondrocytes in articular cartilage as well as in tendon and ligament. Therefore, control over tissue specific COMP expression may be an important aspect in cartilage biology. To begin an analysis of the regulation of COMP expression, we have cloned, sequenced and characterized the entire genomic clone for mouse COMP that includes the COMP promoter. METHODS AND RESULTS: The COMP coding region spans 19 exons over approximately 8.4 kb of DNA. The arrangement and size of the exons have a remarkable similarity to those of the human COMP genomic sequence, indicating a significant degree of genomic conservation. Analysis of a 453 basepair region of the putative COMP promoter reveals two strong transcriptional repressor elements located between position -356 and -304 and between -251 and -180, relative to the start site for transcription. These repressor elements down-regulate transcription from the promoter in a broad spectrum of cell lines. Removal of the repressor DNA sequence from the COMP promoter leads to significant enhancement in transcriptional activity, indicating that this region acts in a dominant manner to transcriptional activators located more proximal to the start site of transcription. This region also represses transcription when linked to a heterologous promoter. CONCLUSIONS: This repressor region probably down-regulates transcription from the COMP promoter in vivo. It may help to repress transcription of COMP in non-cartilaginous tissues and/or may aid in the expression of COMP to the appropriate level in tissues such as cartilage, tendon and ligament.
