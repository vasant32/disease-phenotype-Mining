Bilateral simultaneous elongation of the lower limbs was performed in 3 achondroplastic children. A total of 10 bones were elongated with Wagner's distraction apparatus, mainly by a modified Wagner technique. Maximal elongation of 34 to 44% of the original bone length resulted in relatively minor complications. Elongation of the lower limbs in achondroplastic children improves trunk-to-lower-limb proportions.
