 BACKGROUND: Achondroplasia is an autosomal-dominant disorder resulting in short-limbed dwarfism. Limited data exist regarding the management of pelvic organ prolapse in women with achondroplasia. CASE: A young nulligravid woman with stage IV uterovaginal prolapse desired surgical correction of her prolapse with uterine preservation. The severity of her prolapse, profound cervical elongation, and distortion of the bony pelvis presented surgical challenges. She underwent abdominal lumbohysteropexy with polypropylene mesh. At 1 year postoperative, she has marked improvement in symptoms and objective findings. CONCLUSION: Abdominal lumbohysteropexy appears to be an effective surgical approach in women with achondroplasia desiring uterine preservation.
