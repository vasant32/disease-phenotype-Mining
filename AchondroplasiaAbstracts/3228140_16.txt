Obesity is a significant and potentially serious health problem in achondroplasia. Body mass indices, weight-to-square of the height ratio (W/H2), and triceps skinfold measurements show that obesity is common. It begins in early childhood and is prevalent at all ages. We recommend that weight be monitored closely in all persons with achondroplasia and that dietary intervention be instituted whenever the body mass indices, W/H2, and triceps skinfold measurements exceed the 95th centile for the general population.
