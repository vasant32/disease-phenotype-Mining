Foramen magnum growth curves in achondroplasia and in the general population are presented. The achondroplastic foramen magnum is small at birth, and during the first year it has a severely impaired rate of growth especially in the transverse dimension. This markedly diminished growth results not only from abnormal endochondral bone growth but also because of abnormal placement and premature fusion of the synchondroses. Evaluation of the foramen magnum in achondroplasia should address absolute size of the transverse and sagittal dimensions, shape, and growth centers to determine growth potential of this area.
