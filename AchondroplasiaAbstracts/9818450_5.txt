This study was designed to explore the effects of purified insulin during early stages of chick embryo development, and to search for variations between different molecular structures of the hormone. Chicken embryos were treated in ovo with a single dose of insulin (porcine or bovine), in only one stage of development between day 0 and day 9. Two susceptible periods were found. The earliest period (day 0 to day 3), characterized by abnormalities in the caudal vertebrae and a high mortality rate, was followed by a period with a different set of malformations, a syndrome classified as achondroplasia. The rate of achondroplastic embryos was significantly higher with porcine rather than with bovine insulin. Paradoxically, insulin at physiological doses has stimulatory effects in growth and development but, in contrast, has inhibitory effects at higher doses. The precise signalling cascade of events in the target cells is still unclear. The possible interpretations of our results are discussed. The similarity between the insulin-induced abnormalities in the chicken embryos and the caudal regression syndrome, the most common malformation found in infants of diabetic women, suggests a common mechanism. This circumstance offers the chicken embryos as an excellent in vivo model for research on the mechanism of action of insulin during normal and abnormal development.
