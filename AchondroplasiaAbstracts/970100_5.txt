Articular chondrocytes of achondroplastic mice (cn/cn) resemble ultrastructurally those of their non-achondroplastic siblings (Cn/Cn or Cn/cn), except for premature deposition of glycogen and a tendency to undergo regression. The latter may be slight or extreme. The ultimate cause of the vulnerability of the chondrocytes and the cause of the heterogeneity of the reaction could not be determined with the method employed. Nevertheless, increased vulnerability accounts for cell death under conditions which are usually not injurious, and which may be either physiologic or altered by endogenous or exogenous factors.
