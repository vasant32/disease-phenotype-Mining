A man with pseudoachondroplasia was examined on several occasions between the ages of 13 and 50 years. The patient presented with all the signs typical of the disease: severe rhizomelic dwarfism discovered during the second year of life, relatively normal height of trunk, short and massive hands and feet, waddling gait, gross epiphyseal [corrected] gland alterations and shallow vertebral bodies.

Furthermore, in spite of pronounced epiphyseal lesions [corrected] the patient did not develop severe osteo-arthritis. These findings suggest that beside mechanical factors cellular factors intervene in the development of osteo-arthritis [corrected]
