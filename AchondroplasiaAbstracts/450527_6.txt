We have reviewed the IQ studies on 68 children with skeletal dysplasia. These data should provide useful information for the counseling of parents with newborn affected children. Previous studies have documented retardation and hydrocephalus in association with achondroplasia. Some parents report that they were given a poor prognosis for their child's mental development early in his or her life. This study shows that the 34 children with achondroplasia and 34 with other skeletal dysplasia performed intellectually in the same range as other children.
