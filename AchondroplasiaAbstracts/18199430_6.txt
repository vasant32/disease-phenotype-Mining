 OBJECTIVES: The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3) plays a critical role in cartilage growth-plate differentiation and bony development. It has been shown that 97% of patients with achondroplasia have a G to A transition mutation at position 1138 (c.1138 G>A) of codon 380 of the FGFR3 gene. DESIGN AND METHODS: Exon 8 of the FGFR3 gene was analyzed in 40 patients with achondroplasia, as well as in 50 control individuals for the presence of the c.1138G>A variant using melting curve analysis with a high-resolution melting instrument (HR-1). RESULTS: The high-resolution melting curve analysis successfully genotyped the c.1138G>A mutation in exon 8 of the FGFR3 gene in all 40 patients with achondroplasia without the need of further assays. The technique had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. CONCLUSION: High-resolution melting analysis is a simple, rapid, and sensitive one tube assay for genotyping the FGFR3 gene. The technique is a low cost high-throughput FGFR3 screening assay.
