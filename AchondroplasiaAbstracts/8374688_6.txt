Achondroplasia is one of the most commonly known types of skeletal dysplasia in the adult leading to short stature. Before beginning growth hormone (GH) treatment of short stature in patients with achondroplasia, we evaluated their growth pattern and their hypothalamic-pituitary function, including GH secretion. We studied 22 patients with achondroplasia (7 males and 15 females: age range, 3 to 12 years). The z-score of their height at admission was -5.4 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD), and that of their annual height gain before admission was -3.1 +/- 1.3 (mean +/- SD). GH response to provocative tests was normal in all patients except five: four showed subnormal (< 10 ng/ml) response to L-Dopa stimuli, and one patient showed subnormal (< 20 ng/ml) response to GRF stimuli. The mean GH concentration during sleep was found to be low (< 5 ng/ml) in three patients. These three patients were suspected to have latent GH deficiency, as they also showed a markedly low IGF-1 level and marked delay of bone age. LH, FSH, TSH, and cortisol response to provocative tests were normal in all the patients. We treated this group of patients with recombinant human GH (1 IU/kg/week). In 18 patients who were treated with GH for more than 6 months, height velocity during GH therapy was significantly increased compared to that before GH therapy (4.1 +/- 0.8 cm/year vs 7.2 +/- 1.4 cm/year). We conclude that parameters reflecting hypothalamic-pituitary function, particularly GH secretion, should be examined in achondroplasia patients, and that GH treatment may be beneficial in the treatment of short stature in achondroplasia.
