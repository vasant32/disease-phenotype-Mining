A 45-year-old woman with short stature and primary amenorrhoea was admitted during a health-screening programme. Physical examination revealed a shortness of proximal legs and arms, short stature and other clinical properties of achondroplasia. Secondary sexual characteristics assessment showed axillary hair stage 5, breast stage 4 and pubic hair stage 5 (Tanner staging). Chromosomal analysis showed a 46XX karyotype. Skeletal X-ray showed small iliac wings and narrow sciatic notches. On pelvic ultrasound examination, the uterus appeared infantile and the ovaries were not visualized. Physical examination and laboratory parameters revealed a diagnosis of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of achondroplasia with gonadal dysgenesis discussed in the literature.
