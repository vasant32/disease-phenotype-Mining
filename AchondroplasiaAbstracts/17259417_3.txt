Genu varum in the achondroplastic patient has a complex and multifactorial aetiology. There is little mention in the literature of the role of fibular overgrowth. Using the ratio of fibular to tibial length as a measurement of possible fibular overgrowth, we have related it to the development of genu varum. Full-length standing anteroposterior radiographs of 53 patients with achondroplasia were analysed. There were 30 skeletally-immature and 23 skeletally-mature patients. Regression analysis was performed in order to determine if there was a causal relationship between fibular overgrowth and the various indices of alignment of the lower limb. Analysis showed that the fibular to tibial length ratio had a significant correlation with the medial proximal tibial angle and the mechanical axial deviation in the skeletally-immature group. We conclude that there is a significant relationship between fibular overgrowth and the development of genu varum in the skeletally-immature achondroplastic patient.
