 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia. METHODS: Genomic DNA from seven sporadic cases of achondroplasia was studied by using PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes. RESULTS: All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese. Detecting FGFR 3 gene mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of achondroplasia.
