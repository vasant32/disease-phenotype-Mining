The amniotic band syndrome (ABS) includes intrauterine amputations, syndactyly, fetal disruption, fetal compression deformities and constriction rings associated with disruption of the amniotic membrane. The defects caused by ABS varied from simple digital band constrictions, limb defects to major visceral and craniofacial defects; fetal death may also occur. Because the ABS is a sporadic disorder that may mimic recurrent disorders, such as achondroplasia, anencephaly, Apert's syndrome, etc, it is very important to do appropriate genetic counseling and accurate diagnosis for every infant born with multiple birth defects. We report two severely damaged cases with typical features. This article also reviews the clinical features of ABS, its etiology, pathogenesis, and the status of prenatal and neonatal diagnosis are also discussed.
