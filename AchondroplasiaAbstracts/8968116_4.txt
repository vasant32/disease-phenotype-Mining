The authors analyzed 15 patients affected with achondroplastic dwarfism with vertebral deformity treated surgically between 1976 and 1994. The forms represented were: achondroplasia; diastrophic dwarfism; spondyloepiphyseal achondroplasia. The types of vertebral deformity were: kyphosis: 12 (angular: 6; regular: 6); scoliosis: 1; kyphoscoliosis: 2. Neurological symptoms were present in 10 patients. Treatment was as follows: laminectomy: 8; posterior fusion with instrumentation: 2; anterior fusion: 2; anterior fusion with laminectomy and posterior fusion: 3. There were postoperative neurological complications in 4 cases (27%). Fusion must be performed early in angular kyphosis in the adult in order to prevent neurological symptoms. Wide laminectomies do not require associated fusion because they do not cause late vertebral instability.
