Twenty-six patients (4 months to 6 years old) with achondroplasia complicated by sleep apnea and/or other neurologic manifestations underwent plain computed tomography (CT) of the craniocervical junction; six also underwent CT myelography. For objectification, multiplanar reconstruction was used to complement axial plane measurements by providing coronal and sagittal measurements; multiplanar reconstruction also improved perception of the longitudinal relationships between the brain stem and subarachnoid space. A narrow subarachnoid space was found in all 26 patients; marked cord compression was present in nine, six of whom underwent CT myelography. These six had marked focal obliteration of the subarachnoid space on both plain CT and CT myelography. Since the subarachnoid space immediately above and below the craniocervical junction is normally capacious, when marked constriction was present, no additional information could have been gained from CT myelography. Thus, plain CT was shown to be sufficient for surgical planning (suboccipital decompression) in nine patients with cord compression due to achondroplasia.
