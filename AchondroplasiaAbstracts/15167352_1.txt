: Chronic neutropenia is common in children with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH). The authors describe a 6-year-old with severe CHH, moderate neutropenia associated with serum IgG antibodies directed against Fcgamma-RIIIb (NA1/2), and frequent bacterial infections. In this patient, long-term administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor increased peripheral neutrophil counts and prevented recurrent hospitalizations for bacterial lower respiratory tract infections.
