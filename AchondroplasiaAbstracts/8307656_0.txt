A stand-alone, menu-driven PC program, written in GAUSS386i, for estimating polynomial growth, velocity, and acceleration curves from longitudinal data is described, illustrated and made available to interested readers. Missing data are accommodated: we assume that the study is planned so that individuals will have common times of measurement, but allow some of the sequences to be incomplete. The degrees, Di, adequate to fit the growth profiles of the N individuals are determined and the corresponding polynomial regression coefficients are calculated and can be saved in ASCII files which may then be imported into a statistical computing package for further analysis. Examples of the use of the program are provided.
