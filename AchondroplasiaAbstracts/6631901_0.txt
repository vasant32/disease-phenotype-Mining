A 1-month-old male Bulldog pup was presented with severe dyspnoea and was also unable to stand. Radiographs revealed a considerable dorsoventral flattening of the thoracic cavity, resulting in a reduced intrathoracic volume. The scapula of each foreleg was malpositioned on the thorax, resulting in the inability to adduct the legs and carry the body weight. The clinical signs are typical of an animal suffering from osteochondrodysplasia.
