The fibroblast growth factor-receptor 3 (FGFR3) Lys650 codon is located within a critical region of the tyrosine kinase-domain activation loop. Two missense mutations in this codon are known to result in strong constitutive activation of the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase and cause three different skeletal dysplasia syndromes-thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TD2) (A1948G [Lys650Glu]) and SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans) syndrome and thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1) (both due to A1949T [Lys650Met]). Other mutations within the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase domain (e.g., C1620A or C1620G [both resulting in Asn540Lys]) are known to cause hypochondroplasia, a relatively common but milder skeletal dysplasia. In 90 individuals with suspected clinical diagnoses of hypochondroplasia who do not have Asn540Lys mutations, we screened for mutations, in FGFR3 exon 15, that would disrupt a unique BbsI restriction site that includes the Lys650 codon. We report here the discovery of three novel mutations (G1950T and G1950C [both resulting in Lys650Asn] and A1948C [Lys650Gln]) occurring in six individuals from five families. Several physical and radiological features of these individuals were significantly milder than those in individuals with the Asn540Lys mutations. The Lys650Asn/Gln mutations result in constitutive activation of the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase but to a lesser degree than that observed with the Lys540Glu and Lys650Met mutations. These results demonstrate that different amino acid substitutions at the FGFR3 Lys650 codon can result in several different skeletal dysplasia phenotypes.
