Chondroectodermal dysplasia is a rare mesenchymal - ectodermal dysplasia first described in 1940 by Richard W.B. Ellis and Simon van Creveld now known as Ellis van Creveld syndrome. It is also known as Mesvectodermal dysplasia. Majority of cases were characteristically seen in one particular inbred population from the Amish community of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The syndrome manifests with several skeletal anomalies, oral mucosal and dental anomalies, congenital cardiac defects and nail dysplasia. Ellis van Creveld syndrome may be differentiated from other chondrodystrophies like achondroplasia, chondroplasia punctata, asphyxiating thorasic dystrophy and Morquio's syndrome. The presence of oral mucosal and dental alterations like notching of the lower alveolar process, fusion of the upper lip with gingival mucosal margin, occasional presence of neonatal teeth, oligodontia and conical shape of anterior teeth will confirm the diagnosis of Ellis van Creveld syndrome and hence its importance to dentists.
