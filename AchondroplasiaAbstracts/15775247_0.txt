To improve adult height in the patients with achondroplasia, we have been analyzing molecular mechanism of the growth cartilage differentiation. During this approach, we identified PTH/PTHrP as an important regulatory factor in cartilage differentiation. The manipulation of the PTH/PTHrP activity may serve as a new therapeutic modality.
