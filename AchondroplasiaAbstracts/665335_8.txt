The neurological and radiological findings in a case of chondrodystrophic dwarfism are described. The progressive tetraparesis proved to be based on a high-level medullary compression resulting from basilar impression and upper cervical stenosis. Surgical decompression led to the disappearance of the tetraparetic phenomena. Various aspects of chondrodystrophic dwarfism and basilar impression are discussed in relation to the neurological symptomatology, and the question of whether, in general, more attention should be given to the cranio-cervical region, is raised.
