The AA report a clinical and radiological study performed in 18 achondroplastic patients in order to achieve a nosological settlement of the otological impairments. They found two main otological syndromes; one, a congenital dysplasic syndrome, showing permanent conductive or sensory-neural hearing loss due to malformations of the middle ear or of the inner ear; the other, an inflammatory tubal tympanic syndrome with transient conductive hearing loss, which is relatively frequent in achondroplastic patients, but seems not related to the main disease.
