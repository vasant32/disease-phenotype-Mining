The authors report two cases of achondrogenesis, the first of which was diagnosed in utero. Ultrasonographic abnormalities suggested the diagnosis, which was confirmed radiographically. The diagnosis of achondrogenesis in utero made it possible to avoid a Cesarian. It is always difficult to extract the malformed fetus. The histopathology findings make it possible to codify this rare type of congenital and lethal chondrodysplasia. Achondrogenesis is probably inherited in a recessive and autosomic fashion.
