We report a case of spinal stenosis with ossification of the thoracic ligamentum flavum in a 53-year-old man with achondroplasia. Neurological signs indicated flaccid paralysis below L1, and the patient was unable to walk. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum was observed at T4/5 and T9 to T12, compressing the thecal sac. Laminectomy of T9 to L1 was performed. At one-year follow-up, the patient was able to walk with one elbow crutch.
