A pilot study was carried out to examine the safety and efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone for growth-promoting therapy of achondroplasia. The data suggest that the agent in doses used to treat non-GH-deficient forms of short stature (0.3 mg/kg/wk) modestly increases overall height velocity in some children with achondroplasia. The effect was seen mainly in children with the lowest growth velocities prior to treatment. No untoward effects were noted. Several questions were raised that require further study.
