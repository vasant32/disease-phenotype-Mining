We have reinvestigated the overall size, zone size, mitotic rate and growth rate in the tibial epiphysis of normal and achondroplastic (cn/cn) mice aged 7-55 days. Our present sample did not contain the two phenotypes characteristic of some stocks carrying the gene: cn/cn mice showed smaller zone sizes within the growth plates, smaller cells, decreased mitotic indices and growth rates.
