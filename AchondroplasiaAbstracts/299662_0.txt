Myelography with gas or iophendylate is difficult in patients with spinal anomalies. Metrizamide (Amipaque) has been used to evaluate 20 patients with Chiari malformations, achondroplasia, and conditions related to scoliosis. Lateral cervical puncture was uncomplicated in 10 patients with Chiari malformations. Definition of spinal subarachnoid space was adequate to demonstrate or exclude associated intraspinal tumors or diastematomyelia.
