 OBJECTIVE: To research on the reliability of diagnosing achondroplasia (ACH) on single cell level and to provide a basis for preimplantation genetic diagnosis(PGD). METHODS: The high-frequency mutation region G380R of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene was amplified by nested-PCR with single lymphocyte and single blastomere. The products of PCR were digested by restriction enzyme Bfm I, then the digested products were detected by 10% polyacrylamida gel electrophoresis(PAGE). RESULTS: The amplification success rate, allele dropout rate and correct diagnosis rate of single lymphocyte's PCR were 90.4%, 8.2% and 91.8%,respectively. The amplification success rate of single blastomere was 75.4%. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of ACH by single cell nested-PCR is comparatively stable and reliable.
