The problems of the dwarfs are often not very well known. After reexamining 30 patients, we distributed an extensive questionaire to many other patients. The answers of 136 patients--examinated by punchcards--have given the information about the reason of their limited growth, their troubles and to questions of their familiar and professional integration. As expected most of the patients were those with achondroplasia. In babyhood the most important problem is the diagnosis. On the other hand the adult dwarfs come to the doctor for their complaints. The mostly seen complaints are backpains. It will be reported over postoperative reversible cases of paraplegia in case of narrow lumbar spinal canal and kyphosis. The most frequently carried on opperations are corrective osteotomies of the lower leg. The long-term results were mostly satisfactory. Apart from the medical problems were the social ones which were often as prominent. The patients are frequently lonely and in their profession overtaxed.
