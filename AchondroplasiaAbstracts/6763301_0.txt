In foreign countries Charcot's main contribution in the field is known as Charcot's joint. A special paper is devoted to this topic by Dr Hubault in this issue of the Revue. It is perhaps less widely known that Charcot's thesis was devoted to rheumatoid arthritis and that he wrote also interesting observations on gout. Pierre Marie gave many famous contributions to bones and joints diseases. In 1886 he described acromegaly. In 1890 he described hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy which he correctly linked with lung diseases although some of the cases he had collected in the literature were instances of pachydermo-periostosis. In 1900 he gave a brilliant description of achondroplasia in 2 of his patients: Anatole and Claudius. On the 11th of February 1898 he reported 2 patients which were the basis of a historical description of ankylosing spondylitis, on which papers by Strümpell and von Bechterew had appeared in 1884 and 1893. The subsequent works at the Clinique des Maladies du Système Nerveux de la Salpêtrière on sciatica and herniated disks are related in Professor de Seze's paper in this issue of the Revue.
