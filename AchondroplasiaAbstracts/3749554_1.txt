Lengthening of the humerus has been considered to be particularly risky because of the danger of neurological damage. The Ilizarov technique makes it possible to avoid complications. The authors have performed eight such lengthenings, with gains in length of 8 to 16 cms. Only one case was complicated by an ulnar and radial paralysis which recovered secondarily.
