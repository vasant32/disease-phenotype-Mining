Recent studies report comparable psychosocial adaptation in children with or without a growth disorder. These findings may be due to a general lack of sensitive and specific techniques for analysing and comparing their respective qualities of life. In this study we present a new questionnaire for parents of short-statured children. We suggest both a qualitative and quantitative approach providing specific information about the relative extent of individual stress factors and sources of help. The parents of 442 children with growth retardation resulting from different aetiologies completed the questionnaire. A principal component analysis of the scaled items revealed four dimensions of psychosocial adaptation; suffering, future anxieties, behavioural problems and coping efforts. The index of internal consistency reliability was sufficient for all scales. The comparison of two selected growth disorder groups (achondroplasia versus growth hormone deficiency) demonstrated growth disorder-specific but not very different profiles of psychosocial adaptation. The qualitative analysis revealed a shift in the stress factor patterns (achondroplasia, more physical restrictions). These findings give evidence for both the specificity and construct validity of the new instrument. Therefore, we may conclude that this questionnaire is a helpful method in attaining growth disorder-specific information about individual stress factors, resources and psychosocial adaptation.
