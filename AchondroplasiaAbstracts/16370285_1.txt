The authors present a case of an adolescent with achondroplasia and symptoms of neurogenic claudication who, interestingly, also presented with intermittent priapism. Both the neurogenic claudication and priapism were relieved following a thoracolumbar laminectomy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a dwarf with thoracolumbar spinal canal stenosis presenting with priapism.
