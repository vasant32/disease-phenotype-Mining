We describe the anaesthetic management of a parturient with achondroplasia presenting for Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. A block extending from T4 to S4 was established over 25 min using a total of 12 ml of 2.0% lidocaine (lignocaine) with epinephrine (adrenaline) 1:200,000 and fentanyl 37.5 micrograms. Apart from mild discomfort during peritoneal incision, her perioperative course was uneventful. Achondroplasia is reviewed and the anaesthetic implications of the condition are discussed.
