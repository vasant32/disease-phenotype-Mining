In 1927 Kirner described a congenital deformity of the fifth finger. Since then only 68 cases have been reported and to date many different views in the pathogenesis and treatment exist. The authors report a case of a 13 years-old girl. By a dorso-lateral approach, the distal phalanx was exposed and bone resection performed; alignment was maintained by Kirschner longitudinal wires, parosteal for the left digit and intramedullary for the right. The cosmetic and functional results were good.
