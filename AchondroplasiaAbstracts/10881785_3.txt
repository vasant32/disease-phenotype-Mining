We report the case of a boy with achondroplasia and i(21q) Down syndrome. Besides craniofacial features typical in Down syndrome, the skeletal findings of achondroplasia dominate the clinical picture. The diagnosis of Down syndrome was based on clinical features and the cytogenetic finding of i(21q) trisomy 21. The diagnosis of achondroplasia was based on the presence of clinical and radiographic findings and confirmed by the presence of a common FGFR3 gene mutation (Gly380Arg) detected by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. This is the first report of achondroplasia associated with i(21q) Down syndrome.
