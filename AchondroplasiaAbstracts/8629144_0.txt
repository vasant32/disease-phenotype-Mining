Genetic skeletal dysplasias are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders associated with abnormalities in the skeletal system frequently presenting with disproportionate short stature. There are over 100 distinct skeletal dysplasias which have been classified primarily on the basis of the clinical or radiographic characteristics. We have identified many genetic skeletal dysplasia disorders at Department of Pediatrics, Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. We have cases of achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, pseudoachondroplasia, atelosteogenesis, pyknodysostosis, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED) congenita, spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia (SMED), osteogenesis imperfecta type I, II and III, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis, thanatophoric dysplasia, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, mucopolysaccharidosis I, II, IV and VI, mucolipidosis II, osteopetrosis, camptomelic dysplasia, metaphyseal dysplasia with spine involvement (Kozlowski type), Langer-Gideon syndrome and hypophosphatemic rickets. We have established a Genetic Skeletal Dysplasia Clinic at Siriraj Hospital since 1992, and see referrals from around the country. Genetic counseling is provided, including prenatal diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach.
