Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has recently been identified as a putative gene for achondroplasia. Since a guanine to adenine mutation at 1138 of the cDNA for FGFR3 had been identified in most of the patients in Western population, we examined 13 Japanese patients to see if they also share the same mutation. Specific endonuclease digestion of the amplified coding sequence for the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 revealed that the 12 patients have the G to A change at 1138, while the other had the G to C substitution at the same point, both of which result in G380A substitution. As far as we studied, the homogeneity of the point mutation at 1138 is also authentic to Japanese patient as well as Western patients.
