A 59-year-old male with a history of 2 years of typical trigeminal neuralgia manifested the characteristics of achondroplasia. X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated basilar impression, deformity of the posterior fossa with marked asymmetry of petrous bone and compression of pons and trigeminal nerve by the left vertebral artery and anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Microvascular decompression was performed through a suboccipital craniectomy. The neuralgia disappeared soon after surgery and remains completely resolved until today. This is the first reported case of trigeminal neuralgia in a patient with achondroplasia. The deformity of the skull base was considered to influence the development of the trigeminal neuralgia.
