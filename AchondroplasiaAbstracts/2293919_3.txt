From 1982 to 1986, 43 humeral lengthenings were performed on 29 patients using the Ilizarov technique. Diagnoses included achondroplasia, old septic arthritis, birth palsy, fracture, congenital shortening, and benign neoplasm. The achondroplastic patients (14) had bilateral lengthenings. There were 16 male and 13 female patients aged ten to 36 years (mean, 18 years). The total lengthening in each segment ranged from 5 to 16 cm (mean, 9 cm) and mean treatment time from four to 14 months (mean, eight months). The average follow-up time was 2.7 years (range, 0.5-5.5 years). Functional and aesthetic results were all graded as excellent or good. There were no cases of osteomyelitis or deep infection. Three patients sustained neuropraxias that subsequently resolved completely. There were seven fractures in six patients following removal of the apparatus. Five were treated with casts and two with replication of the apparatus. All healed uneventfully. Humeral lengthening can be safely performed with excellent clinical results using the Ilizarov technique.
