C-type natiruetic peptide (CNP) showed a potent effect on the elongation of the tibial organ culture system. CNP also corrected the dwarfing phenotype of the CNP knockout mice. These results suggest that CNP is the novel promoter of the endochondral ossification, and that CNP/GC-B activation is possible target of the treatment of the achondroplasia.
