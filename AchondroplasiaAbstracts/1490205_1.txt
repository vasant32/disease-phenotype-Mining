A new "bloodless" technique (Ilizarov) was used to correct 36 limb deformities in 29 children. There were six leg length discrepancies, five achondroplasias, four deformed feet, five joint contractures, one rotational deformity of tibia, and in three the apparatus was used as an external fixator after corrective osteotomy. Lengthening was accomplished in 15 of the 16 procedures (93%). Average increase in femur length was 10 cm (32%), in tibial length 7.5 cm (30%), in humerus 11 cm (40%). Bony union was achieved in two out of five pseudoarthroses. Four deformed feet were fully corrected. Joint contractures were corrected in four out of five. The complication rate is as high as in other methods but with the Ilizarov apparatus, longer segments of bone were lengthened and more complex deformities were treated. Complications lessened as experience was gained.
