Two cases of visual loss after spinal fusion surgery are described. In both cases, surgery was lengthy, the patient's head was placed in a dependent position, and hemodilution and deliberate hypotension were combined. One patient was achondroplastic, the other obese. Possible risk factors associated with ischemic optic neuropathy after anesthesia and surgery are discussed.
