Achondroplasia is a common form of human dwarfism with characteristically rhizomelic shortening of extremities and relative macrocephaly. It is transmitted as an autosomally dominant inheritance, and about 80% of affected individuals result from sporadic mutations without positive family histories. Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development. The most common genetic mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380. Based on genetic information, molecular genetic testing can provide an exact diagnosis comparing to radiological and prenatal ultrasound evaluations. Here we introduce denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for the detection of 17 cases of achondroplasia and 120 unaffected cases. After coupling heteroduplex and fluorescence-enhanced primer-extension analysis, all affected patients with G1138A were identified successfully. In conclusion, we demonstrated that DHPLC is an efficient, accurate, and sensitive technique to detect the single gene mutation of achondroplasia in clinical applications.
