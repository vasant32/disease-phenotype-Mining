The characteristics of spinal restenosis in achondroplasia and its treatment are evaluated in this study. Radiologic and surgical findings were correlated to establish the causes of achondroplastic spinal restenosis and the benefits of its therapy. Eight patients (five men, three women) with spinal restenotic complications of achondroplasia were studied. The most common neurological sign of recurrent stenosis was impaired motor function. The mean interval between the most recent surgeries was 8.2 years (9.5 years for surgeries at the same levels). The most common causes of recurrent stenosis were facet hypertrophy and disk disease. The complications were a dural tear and cerebellar hemorrhage in one patient and transient neurological deterioration in another. One patient died after operation. Restenosis can occur many years after original decompression in the achondroplastic spine, and repeated operation can successfully lessen pain and neurological symptoms in most patients.
