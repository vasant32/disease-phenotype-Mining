Achondroplasia (ACH) is a skeletal disorder (MIM100800) with an autosomal dominant Mendelian inheritance and complete penetrance. Here we report the screening of ancient bone samples for diagnostic ACH mutations. The diagnostic G-->A transition in the FGFR3 gene at cDNA position 1138 was detected in cloned polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products obtained from the dry mummy of the Semerchet tomb, Egypt (first dynasty, approximately 4,890-5,050 BP [before present]), and from an individual from Kirchheim, Germany (Merovingian period, approximately 1,300-1,500 BP), both of which had short stature. However, these mutations were also reproducibly observed in four ancient control samples from phenotypically healthy individuals (false-positives), rendering the reliable molecular typing of ancient bones for ACH impossible. The treatment of a false-positive DNA extract with uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) to minimize type 2 transitions (G-->A/C-->T) did not reduce the frequency of the false-positive diagnostic ACH mutations. Recently, it was suggested that ancient DNA extracts may induce mutations under PCR. Contemporary human template DNA from a phenotypically healthy individual was therefore spiked with an ancient DNA extract from a cave bear. Again, sequences with the diagnostic G-->A transition in the FGFR3 gene were observed, and it is likely that the false-positive G-->A transitions result from errors introduced during the PCR reaction. Amplifications in the presence of MnCl(2) indicate that position 1138 of the FGFR3 gene is particularly sensitive for mutations. Our data are in line with previously published results on the occurrence of nonrandom mutations in PCR products of contemporary human mitochondrial HVRI template DNA spiked with ancient DNA extracts.
