Hypochondrogenesis is one of non-viable skeleton dysplasiae which recently has been delimited as an entity of its own and with its classification between spondylo-epiphysary dysplasia and achondrogenesis. An accurate differential diagnosis requires specialised histo-pathological investigations of the patient's cartilage tissue. Five new observations compared to a classical case of dysplasia spondylo-epiphysaria congenita are added to the references made in literature.
