The morphological development of the epiphyseal growth plate and intervertebral discs of newborn and nine-month-old beagles, greyhounds and dachshunds have been studied. On the basis of the cellular and matrix development of these canine tissues together with the known characteristics associated with achondroplasia it is concluded that the beagle should be assigned to the chondrodystroid breed classification.
