Stumpy is a new chondrodystrophic mutant in the mouse. The condition is inherited as a fully penetrant Mendelian recessive, and is not allelic with brachymorphic, achondroplasia, or stubby-three similar, previously described mutants. No chromosomal position has yet been assigned to the gene. Phenotypically, stumpy mice are chondrodystrophic dwarfs with all cartilage-formed bones in the skeleton affected. The condition differs from the usual chondrodystrophy described in mice in that proximal elements in the limbs are affected more than distal ones.
