The technique of lengthening the tibia with the Ilisarov device is explained. Different variations (bifocal or simultaneous) of the method are demonstrated, as well as the results of 53 cases of tibia lengthening in 37 patients of our hospital between 1986 and 1989. In 14 patients, a second operative procedure was necessary during treatment. In no case was internal fixation or grafting necessary. The Ilisarov ring fixator is very efficient, especially in major lengthening procedures and for simultaneous correction of deformities.
