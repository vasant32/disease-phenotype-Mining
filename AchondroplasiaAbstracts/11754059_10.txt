We report two patients with clinical and radiological findings of achondroplasia, who had the most common FGFR3 mutation occurring in thanatophoric dysplasia type I and hypochondroplasia, respectively. Thanatophoric dysplasia is usually a lethal condition, but the patient carrying this mutation is alive and presents a medical history similar to that of patients with achondroplasia. The events leading to such a discrepancy between genotype and phenotype are unclear. These rare cases may influence an appropriate medical and genetic counseling.
