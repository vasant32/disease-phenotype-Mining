This report describes six cases of achondroplasia, four of whom died unexpectedly in early childhood. Clinical details and pathological findings are reported. Unexpected death seems to be a feature of children with achondroplasia, and appears to be related to brain-stem lesions secondary to deformities of the foramen magnum and posterior fossa.
