Achondroplasia is a congenital disorder resulting from a specific disturbance in endochondral bone formation. The ophthalmic features reportedly associated with achondroplasia are telecanthus, exotropia, inferior oblique overaction, angle anomalies and cone-rod dystrophy. This is first report of chorioretinal coloboma in achondroplasia. An 8-year-old female was diagnosed with a developmental delay, known as achondroplasia, seven months after birth. Upon her initial visit, visual acuity was 0.3 in both eyes. The patient had telecanthus but normal ocular motility. Findings were normal upon anterior segment examination. Fundus examination of both eyes revealed about 1,500 Âµm sized chorioretinal coloboma inferior to the optic nerve head. Upon fluorescent angiography, there was chorioretinal coloboma without any other lesions. Afterward, there was no change in the fundus lesion, and best corrected visual acuity was 0.6 in both eyes. Chorioretinal coloboma is associated with choroidal and retinal detachment. As chorioretinal coloboma and achondroplasia are developmental disorders in the embryonic stage, early detection and regular ophthalmologic examination would be essential in patients with achondroplasia.
