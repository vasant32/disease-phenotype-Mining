A 25 years old lady came to Centre for Nuclear Medicine and Ultrasound, Mymensingh for ultrasonographic evaluation of gestational condition. Transabdominal ultrasonogram showed mal development of skeletal system with abnormally shortened limbs. This seems to be a case of achnodroplasia, which was proved subsequently true after termination of pregnancy.
