Pattern recognition techniques have been applied to the analysis of metacarpophalangeal lengths obtained from hand radiographs. A data base consisting of healthy subjects, and subjects exhibiting achondroplasia, Down's syndrome, and Turner's syndrome was studied. A classification technique was found which effectively separates these conditions. The technique is suitable for computer automation.
