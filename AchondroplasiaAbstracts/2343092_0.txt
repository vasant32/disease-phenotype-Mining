Two cases are reported: A young women of 18 with pseudo-achondroplasia and a 13 year old boy with hypochondroplasia. Similarities and differences between both diseases, achondroplasia and epiphyseal dysplasia are pointed out. It is likely, that the achondroplastic symptom complex and dysplastic processes of the epiphysis (in pseudo-achondroplasia under the spinal column) are no reason to regard these diseases as special forms of achondroplasia and epiphyseal dysplasia. They are independent diseases.
