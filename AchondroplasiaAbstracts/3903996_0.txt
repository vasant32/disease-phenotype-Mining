The pregnancy of a woman with achondroplasia was monitored by ultrasound from the 29th to the 38th week of gestation. Starting with the 29th week of gestation, there was a suspicion of the foetus having the same skeletal dysplasia. The following measurements were in the pathological range: the length of the upper arm, the humerus, the lower arm, the thigh, the femur, the leg, the tibia, as well as the maximal thigh diameter, the ratios of thigh diameter to crown-rump length and maximal thigh diameter to the biparietal diameter. Unsuspected head-rump measures associated with measurements, displayed an achondroplasia which had been discovered in the newborn.
