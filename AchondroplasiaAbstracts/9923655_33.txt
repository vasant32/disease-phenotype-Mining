Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) is a large extracellular glycoprotein that is found in the territorial matrix surrounding chondrocytes. Two skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM1) are caused by mutations in the calcium binding domains of COMP. In this study, we identified two PSACH mutations and assessed the effect of these mutations on redifferentiated chondrocyte structure and function. We confirmed, in vitro, that COMP is retained in enormous cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and relatively absent in the PSACH matrix. The rER accumulation may compromise chondrocyte function, leading to chondrocyte death. Moreover, while COMP appears to be deficient in the PSACH matrix, the matrix appeared to be normal but the over-all quantity was reduced. These results suggest that the abnormality in linear growth in PSACH may result from decreased chondrocyte numbers which would also affect the amount of matrix produced.
