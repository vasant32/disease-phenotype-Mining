The treatment of this patient serves to demonstrate a craniofacial team approach to a unique and moderately severe problem. By the modification and careful combination of standard techniques, i.e., frontofacial advancement, and Le Fort I and vertical mandibular osteotomy, a good correction has been obtained. Analysis of the problem clearly indicated the need for moving multiple components of the facial skeleton into new positions to provide correction. The upper and lower midface required simultaneous movements in exactly opposite directions to normalize the skeletal deformity. To address the excess forehead height and projection, a modification of the usual frontofacial advancement was necessary. Rotation of the frontofacial segment forward inferiorly allowed correction of the orbital deficiency while also allowing shortening of the vertical forehead dimension. This is a deviation from the straight linear advancement usually dissected. Simultaneous retroposition and rotation of the maxilla allowed correction of the plane of occlusion while lengthening the midface. The unique combination and application of standard techniques of craniofacial surgery in this patient allowed a very good result.
