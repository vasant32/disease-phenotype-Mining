A 13-year-old male achondroplastic dwarf with fixed thoracolumbar kyphosis was treated by segmental pedicle screw fixation, posterolateral fusion combined with one stage two level posterior column resection. Preoperative and postoperative kyphosis angles were 97 and 32 degrees, respectively. Combination of segmental pedicle instrumentation with posterior column resection is a treatment option even in immature achondroplastic patients.
