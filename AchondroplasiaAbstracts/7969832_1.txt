We describe our experience with total craniospinal decompression along the entire neuraxis, extending from the brain stem to the cauda equina, in seven patients with achondroplasia. These patients presented with clinically significant compression at multiple levels. In these patients, there were focal areas of complete myelographic block, typically at the cervicothoracic or thoracolumbar junction, as well as diffuse narrowing of the entire spinal subarachnoid space. In some, there were further complications of basilar impression, Arnold-Chiari malformation, or syringomyelia. Total craniospinal decompression was completed in either one or two stages. Only a small minority of our patients with achondroplasia had critical stenosis over this many levels, requiring total craniospinal decompression. However, with proper preparation and technique, we found that patients can tolerate even such an extensive decompressive procedure and benefit from surgery without suffering postoperative spinal instability.
