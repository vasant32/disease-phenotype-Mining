Analysis of retrospective growth data from 72 patients with diastrophic dysplasia, 62 patients with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita and 61 patients with pseudoachondroplasia permitted the establishment of preliminary reference growth standards for height for each disorder. In addition, a comparison of mean height curves for these three disorders and achondroplasia revealed dissimilarities in growth patterns.
