 OBJECTIVE: The use of midface distraction in patients with achondroplasia and upper airway obstruction secondary to midface hypoplasia has not been reported. In this report, we review the treatment of two patients with severe midface hypoplasia and obstructive sleep apnea secondary to achondroplasia using midface distraction osteogenesis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Two patients with achondroplastic dwarfism and midface hypoplasia with airway obstruction were treated in a tertiary referral center for craniofacial disorders. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both patients had their tracheostomies decannulated after midface distraction of 25 mm. Midface distraction osteogenesis is useful to alleviate upper airway obstruction from midface hypoplasia seen in achondroplasia.
