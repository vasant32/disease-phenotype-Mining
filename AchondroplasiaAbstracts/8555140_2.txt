Carcinoma of the gallbladder in an extremely rare tumor in childhood. We have found only five cases in the literature. Most of them were associated with an ethnic group - The Navajo Indians - who are known to have high incidence of gallbladder disease. We report here on the exceptional presence of this type of tumor in a child, who also had achondroplasia. This, as far as we can determine, is the first such case ever reported.
