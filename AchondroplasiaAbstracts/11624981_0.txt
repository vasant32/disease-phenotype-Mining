The cultural topic of malformations is universal by its questionning. Malformations and inherited diseases have been observed and represented since Antiquity. These sculptures and pictures inform about mentalities and behaviours in front of severe birth defects. Dysmorphic syndromes can be identifiable, like achondroplasia, whereas others dwarfisms are arguable. Hermaphroditism has a cosmic meaning. Failing that rational explanation, major abnormalities were considered as monsters of supernatural origin.
