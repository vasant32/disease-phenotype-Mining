Genetic syndromes that include short stature are recognized by their effect on children's growth rates, by their effect on the growth rate and pubertal development in adolescence, and by the presence of stigmata associated with certain syndromes. The effects of Down, Seckel, Turner, Russell-Silver, Prader-Willi, and Noonan syndromes on growth and the growth-inhibiting features of achondroplasia, hypophosphatemic rickets, and Laron dwarfism are reviewed. The terminology used by professionals in discussing genetic alterations should minimize the effects of labeling and stigmatization and should emphasize the normal aspects of a child's life.
