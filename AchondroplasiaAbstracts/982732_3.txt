Representative case summaries of patients with different types of neurogenic bladder diagnosed by combined cystometric-perineal electromyography and treated with bethanechol (Urecholine) are presented. Determination of the activity of the periurethral striated muscle in relation to bladder dysfunction is extremely important in the selection of patients for bethanechol therapy. In the absence of structural obstruction, bethanechol can be used in patients with (1) the early phase of coordinated reflex neurogenic bladder and sphincter when there is incomplete bladder emptying due to feeble or unsustained detrusor contractions, (2) recovery phase of spinal shock when the periurethral striated muscle has recovered and is under voluntary control, (3) incomplete motor paralytic bladder with coordinated sphincter, and (4) sensory paralytic bladder with decompensation. The bethanechol regimen will vary in accordance with the type of bladder being treated.
