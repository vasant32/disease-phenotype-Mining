Despite the growing body of knowledge on the natural history of various chondrodystrophies, little is known of the associated obstetric and gynecologic problems. The authors have surveyed by questionnaire 150 women with chondrodystrophies after a request by the women of Little People of America and Little People of Canada that a survey of their members be carried out. It was found that some obstetric and gynecologic problems are common to all women with short stature. There is an increased incidence of menstrual complications, problems with certain methods of contraception, and evidence of reduced fertility. In addition, delivery should almost always be by cesarean section under general anesthesia. There are, however, some unique complications in specific chondrodystrophies in the present study group. Women with achondroplasia have premature menopause and an increased incidence of leiomyomata; women with osteogenesis imperfecta have late menarche; and women with pseudoachondroplasia and cartilage hair hypoplasia have long menstrual cycles.
