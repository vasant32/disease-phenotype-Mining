An inflammatory pseudotumour of the lung in an achondroplastic woman is described. The occurrence of both conditions in the same patient probably represents a coincidental finding. However, recurrent pulmonary infections, as frequently seen in achondroplasia, may be relevant, because a history of antecedent infection is noted in one third of cases of inflammatory pseudotumours. Despite extensive debridement of the pseudotumour by neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet (NdYAG) laser therapy, early recurrence occurred.
