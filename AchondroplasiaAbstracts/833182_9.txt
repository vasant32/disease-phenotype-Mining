Fourteen patients who had neurological symptoms associated with achondroplastic dwarfism and who had spine surgery were analyzed, as were an additional twenty-nine cases reported in the literature. Four types of neurological patterns emerged, based on the onset, symptoms, and physical examination. Some etiological correlation between the anatomical lesion and the result was made in each category, and a reliable prognosis related to the pattern is now possible. Early and appropriately extensive surgery may well be recommended, based on the patients treated.
