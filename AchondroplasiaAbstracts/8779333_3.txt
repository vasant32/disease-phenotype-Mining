Several pathogenetic factors, alone or in combination, may contribute to the increased frequency of respiratory complications in achondroplasia. It has been suggested that relatively small chest circumference sometimes may contribute. However, there are no published curves of chest circumference for age in achondroplasia with which to compare patients. Nor are there data relating chest circumference to overall size in achondroplasia. We present curves of chest circumference for males and females with achondroplasia from birth through age 7 years. Additional curves for chest circumference against height are also provided. Finally, we report some preliminary data regarding the possible association of chest size with respiratory signs and symptoms.
