<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to VCR was associated with prolonged retention of VCR by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> after a single i.p. injection, whereas in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with acquired or intrinsic VCR resistance the drug was eliminated more rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with prolonged retention of drug also showed increased levels of mitotic accumulation for up to 72 hr following VCR administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were good correlations between VCR sensitivity, VCR retention and the proposed mechanism of VCR cytotoxicity-mitotic arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A model has been developed consistent with data obtained that can explain the responsiveness to VCR of a series of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> xenografts irrespective of their tissue of origin </plain></SENT>
