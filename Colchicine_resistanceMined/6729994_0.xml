<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are distinct from each other both in the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and in the phenotypic stability of this feature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluctuation tests showed that the generation of drug resistant variants in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> population was random and did not depend on the action of selective agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of spontaneous occurrence of these variants was approximatley 1.79 x 10(-6) per cell per generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="21759">MNNG</z:chebi> enhanced the frequency of ClchR variants by 100 fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxic effect of Clch on resistant cells has been potentiated by non-ionic detergent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53426">Tween 80</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the stable resistant clones appeared to be cross resistant to unrelated drugs such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, ethydium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi> and aminopterine  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These two observations allow to suggest the alteration of membrane permeability as a mechanism of resistance to Clch  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genetical mechanisms of Clch -resistance of cells are discussed </plain></SENT>
