<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant clone, C2(90) (IC50 = 62 microM, and 1.5 mM, respectively), and the parental clone, A (IC50 = 5 microM and 1 mM, respectively), were analyzed for resistance to other drugs and for the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both clones, C2(90) and A, exhibited similar resistance to both daunomycin (IC50 = 50 microM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> (IC50 = 13 nM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, the IC50 for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> was reduced to 0.5 microM, while the IC50 for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> was reduced to 0.3 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reverses both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in the mutant C2(90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In uptake experiments with [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4781">emetine</z:chebi>, drug accumulation was lower in resistant trophozoites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, drug accumulation was increased in clone C2(90) to a level close to that of the parental strain, clone A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with observations made using <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">malaria</z:e> and multidrug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells and suggest that a P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-like molecule may play a role in drug resistance in E. histolytica </plain></SENT>
