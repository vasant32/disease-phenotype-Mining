<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The multidrug transporter is a 170,000-dalton membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> which confers multidrug resistance through its activity as an ATP-dependent efflux pump for hydrophobic, cytotoxic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the essential structural components of this complex membrane transporter we have altered an MDR1 cDNA in an expression vector by deletion and insertion mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The structure of the transporter deduced from its amino acid sequence suggests that it consists of two homologous, perhaps functionally autonomous, halves each with six transmembrane segments and a cytoplasmic ATP-binding domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, several carboxyl-terminal deletions, one involving 53 amino acids, the second removing 253 amino acids, and an internal deletion within the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule, totally eliminate the ability of the mutant transporter to confer drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An internal deletion of the amino-terminal half, which removed residues 140-229, is also nonfunctional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small carboxylterminal deletions of up to 23 amino acids leave a functional transporter, although the removal of 23 COOH-terminal amino acids reduces its ability to confer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insertions of 4 amino acids in a transmembrane domain, and in one of the two ATP-binding regions, have no effect on activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies define some of the limits of allowable deletions and insertions in the MDR1 gene, and demonstrate the requirement for two intact halves of the molecule for a functional multidrug transporter </plain></SENT>
