<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recently developed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38828">non-ionic surfactant</z:chebi> called Solutol HS 15 (poly-oxyethylene <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> of 12-hydroxystearic acid), with low toxicity in vivo, was shown to reverse completely the multidrug resistance of KB 8-5 and KB 8-5-11 human epidermoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells in vitro but did not potentiate drug toxicity in drug-sensitive KB 3-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At a concentration of 10% of its own IC50 (mean concentration of drug that causes 50% inhibition of cell growth compared to controls), Solutol HS 15 produced a 35-, 28-, and 42-fold reduction in the resistance of KB 8-5-11 cells to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, vinblastine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Solutol HS 15 was relatively much more potent than the prototypic reversing agent, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, for reversing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, compared to the ability of each agent to reverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, compared to the ability of each agent to reverse vinblastine resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Like <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, Solutol HS 15 promoted a 50-fold accumulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> in KB 8-5-11 cells, as measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also, Solutol HS 15 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reduced the efflux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> from KB 8-5-11 cells previously loaded with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">rhodamine 123</z:chebi> to a similar low rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Solutol HS 15 did not affect the transport of alanine or <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> into KB 8-5-11 cells, indicating that its effect upon membrane active transport is not entirely nonspecific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Considering their different structure and different relative potency for reversing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, Solutol HS 15 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> probably reverse multidrug resistance by different mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Solutol HS 15 merits consideration as a potential therapeutic agent because of its effectiveness for reversing multidrug resistance in vitro and its low toxicity in vivo </plain></SENT>
