<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cell lines are characterized by the different levels of drug-resistance (1000- to 16000-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation is found between the reversion rate of malignant phenotype and the cellular drug-resistance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tumorigenicity and anchorage independence decrease with an increase of the drug-resistance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actin-containing bundles of microfilaments in more resistant cells are more organized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 22 kD protein content increases with the drug-resistance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> reversion are discussed </plain></SENT>
