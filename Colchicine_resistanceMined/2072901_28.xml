<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cell lines overproduce a membrane protein, the P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>, which is encoded by a member(s) of a multigene family, termed mdr or pgp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of the P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> predicts an energy-dependent transport protein with homology to a large superfamily of proteins which transport a wide variety of substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report describes the isolation and characterization of two Drosophila homologs of the mammalian mdr gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These homologs, located in chromosomal sections 49EF and 65A, encode proteins that share over 40% amino acid identity to the human and murine mdr P-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fly strains bearing disruptions in the homolog in section 49EF have been constructed and implicate this gene in conferring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance to the organism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This work sets the foundation for the molecular and genetic analysis of mdr homologs in Drosophila melanogaster </plain></SENT>
