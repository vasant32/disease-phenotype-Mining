<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-1 is a key proinflammatory cytokine in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of rilonacept, an interleukin-1 decoy receptor, in treating patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant or -intolerant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, single-participant alternating treatment study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00582907) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: 6 U.S. sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> aged 4 years or older with 1 or more attacks per month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: One of 4 treatment sequences that each included two 3-month courses of rilonacept, 2.2 mg/kg (maximum, 160 mg) by weekly subcutaneous injection, and two 3-month courses of placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Differences in the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> attacks and adverse events between rilonacept and placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 8 males and 6 females with a mean age of 24.4 years (SD, 11.8) were randomly assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 12 participants who completed 2 or more treatment courses, the rilonacept-placebo attack risk ratio was 0.59 (SD, 0.12) (equal-tail 95% credible interval, 0.39 to 0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median number of attacks per month was 0.77 (0.18 and 1.20 attacks in the first and third quartiles, respectively) with rilonacept versus 2.00 (0.90 and 2.40, respectively) with placebo (median difference, -1.74 [95% CI, -3.4 to -0.1]; P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were more treatment courses of rilonacept without attacks (29% vs. 0%; P = 0.004) and with a decrease in attacks of greater than 50% compared with the baseline rate during screening (75% vs. 35%; P = 0.006) than with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the duration of attacks did not differ between placebo and rilonacept (median difference, 1.2 days [-0.5 and 2.4 days in the first and third quartiles, respectively]; P = 0.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Injection site reactions were more frequent with rilonacept (median difference, 0 events per patient treatment month [medians of -4 and 0 in the first and third quartiles, respectively]; P = 0.047), but no differences were seen in other adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>LIMITATION: Small sample size, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> mutations, age, and participant indication (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance or intolerance) were study limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rilonacept reduces the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> attacks and seems to be a treatment option for patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant or -intolerant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
