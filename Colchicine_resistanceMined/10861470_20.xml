<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have obtained a novel multidrug resistant cell line, derived from HT29 G(+) human colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> cells, by selection with gradually increasing concentrations of the anti-mitotic, microtubule-disrupting agent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This HT29(col) cell line displayed a 25-fold increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and exhibited cross-resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting, combined with RT-PCR showed that the multidrug resistance phenotype was conferred by specific overexpression of the multidrug resistance protein 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confocal scanning laser microscopy revealed that multidrug resistance protein 1 specifically localized in the plasma membrane of HT29(col) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a functional assay, using the fluorescent multidrug resistance protein 1 substrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51617">5-carboxyfluorescein</z:chebi>, an increased efflux activity of HT29(col) cells was measured, as compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> HT29 G(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK571, a specific inhibitor of multidrug resistance protein 1, blocked the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51617">5-carboxyfluorescein</z:chebi> efflux, but only partially reversed resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, indicating that additional multidrug resistance mechanisms operate in HT29(col) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results show for the first time overexpression of a functional multidrug resistance protein 1 under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> pressure, indicating that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> is not a P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-specific substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi>-induced overexpression of multidrug resistance protein 1 is accompanied by a changed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26739">sphingolipid</z:chebi> composition, i.e., enhanced levels of glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> messenger molecule involved in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related signal transduction processes, was much more abundant in HT29(col) cells, which is indicative of a stress response </plain></SENT>
