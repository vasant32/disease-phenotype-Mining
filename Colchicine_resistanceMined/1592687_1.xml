<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of various <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53223">polyether</z:chebi> antibiotics on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in multidrug-resistant KB-C4 cells which exhibit about 4,000-fold resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, 4 out of 14 polyether antibiotics were found to reverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, laidlomycin was the most potent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It potentiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> cytotoxicity on KB-C4 cells about 700-fold at 1 microgram/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degree of potentiation was calculated by dividing of the IC50 value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in the absence of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53223">polyether</z:chebi> antibiotic by the IC50 value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in the presence of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53223">polyether</z:chebi> antibiotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monensin, dianemycin, and leuseramycin at 3 micrograms/ml also potentiated the cytotoxicity, about 100-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that inostamycin is a potent chemosensitizer in KB-C4 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although lysocellin has a structure very similar to that of inostamycin, it didn't reverse <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It slightly increased [3H]vinblastine accumulation in KB-C4 cells and weakly inhibited the [3H]vinblastine binding to KB-C4 plasma membranes </plain></SENT>
