<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was observed between the level of cross-resistance and the relative hydrophobicity of these compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutants also showed increased (collateral) sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="36333">local anaesthetics</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8430">procaine</z:chebi>, tetracaine, xylocaine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8499">propanolol</z:chebi>), steroid hormones (1-dehydrotestosterone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16827">corticosterone</z:chebi> and 5beta-pregnan-3,20-dione) and some <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X compounds </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the pleiotropic phenotype being the result of the same mutation(s) which confer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and support a model for resistance in which the reduced permeability is assumed to be the result of an alteration in the modulation of the fluidity of the surface membrane </plain></SENT>
