<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>10 independent clones of Djungarian hamster DM-15 and DMCAP cells 16-22-fold resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug resistance was unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During cultivation in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> free medium, 1-2% cells per population doubling lost resistance to selective dosage of the drug (0,1 microgram/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was stepwise: the cells lost resistance to some concentrations of the drug but retained resistance to the lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> dosages toxic for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analysis of chromosomes stained by the trypsin G-banding technique showed the specific karyotypic alteration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells of 10 clones, i.e. complete or partial <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, in some cells of 7 clones small chromatin bodies (SCB) and chromosomes bearing long homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was accompanied by the disappearance of cells containing SCB and HSRs and the decrease in the number of cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the direct correlation between the loss of drug resistance and that of additional material of chromosome 4 was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Probably, the resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> is connected in these clones with gene amplification, and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 4 is involved in the development of gene amplification </plain></SENT>
