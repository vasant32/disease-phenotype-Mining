<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secondary AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> is the worst complication of the disease and often determines the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MEFV gene, on chromosome 16p13.3, is responsible for the disease and around 30 mutations have been reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> is the standard <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> treatment today, and prevents both attacks and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in 95% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a three-generation Spanish kindred with five family members affected by a severe periodic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorder</z:e> associated with renal AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> unresponsiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis of definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> disease was made based on the Tel-Hashomer criteria set </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genetic analyses revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were heterozygous for the new H478Y MEFV variant, segregating with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, mutations in the TNFRSF1A and CIAS1/PYPAF1/NALP3 genes, related to the dominantly inherited autoinflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndromes</z:e>, were ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of the disease, the long <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> episodes with a predominant joint involvement, and the resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in these patients raise the question of whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> seen in this kindred is a true <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> disease with unusual manifestations or rather another MEFV-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the new H478Y MEFV mutation is the dominant pathological variant causing the inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">periodic syndrome</z:e> in this kindred and that full-length analyses of the MEFV gene are needed to obtain an adequate diagnosis of patients with clinical suspicion of a hereditary periodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> syndrome, especially those from non-ancestral populations </plain></SENT>
