<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Broad substrate specificity of human P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (ABCB1) is an essential feature of multidrug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transport substrates of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> are mostly hydrophobic and many of them have net positive charge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These compounds partition into the membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Utilizing the energy of ATP hydrolysis, P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is thought to take up substrates from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane and to transport them to the outside of the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We examined this model by molecular dynamics simulation of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> bilayer, in the presence of transport substrates together with an atomic resolution structural model of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together with previous electron paramagnetic resonance studies, the results suggest that most transported drugs are concentrated near the surface zone of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here the drugs can easily diffuse laterally into the drug-binding site of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> through an open cleft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the initial high-affinity drug-binding site was located in the interfacial surface area of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in contact with the membrane interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these results and our recent kinetic studies, a "solvation exchange" drug transport mechanism of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A molecular basis for the improved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> transport efficiency by the much-studied <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance G185V mutant human P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> is also provided </plain></SENT>
