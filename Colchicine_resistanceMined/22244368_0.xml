<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> are autoinflammatory disorders, associated with genes (MEFV and NOD2/CARD15, respectively) encoding for regulatory proteins, important in innate immunity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, cytokine processing, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although mutations in the MEFV gene were shown to modify <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, the role of NOD2/CARD15 gene mutations in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> disease phenotype was never studied before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort consisted of 103 consecutive children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>, followed in a single referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NOD2/CARD15 genotypes were analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 299 ethnically matched unaffected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and disease course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients with and without NOD2/CARD15 mutation were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A single NOD2/CARD15 mutation was detected in 10 (9.7%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients and 26 (8.7%) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No homozygous or compound heterozygous subjects were discovered in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients carrying a NOD2/CARD15 mutation had a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001055'>erysipelas</z:hpo>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> scrotum attacks, a trend for a higher rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and a more severe disease as compared with patients without mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NOD2/CARD15 mutations are not associated with an increased susceptibility to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the presence of these mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients appears to be associated with a trend to a more severe disease </plain></SENT>
