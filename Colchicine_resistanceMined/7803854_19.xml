<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The respective roles of neurofilaments (NFs), microtubules (MTs), and the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP 1B and tau on neurite outgrowth and stabilization were probed by the intracellular delivery of specific antisera into transiently permeabilized NB2a/d1 cells during treatment with dbcAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracellular delivery of antisera specific for the low (NF-L), middle (NF-M), or extensively phosphorylated high (NF-H) molecular weight subunits did not prevent initial neurite elaboration, nor did it induce retraction of existing neurites elaborated by cells that had been previously treated for 1 d with dbcAMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, intracellular delivery of antisera directed against tubulin reduced the percentage of cells with neurites at both these time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracellular delivery of anti-NF-L and anti-NF-M antisera did not induce retraction in cells treated with dbcAMP for 3 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, intracellular delivery of antisera directed against extensively phosphorylated NF-H, MAP1B, tau, or tubulin induced similar levels of neurite retraction at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular delivery of monoclonal antibodies (RT97 or SMI-31) directed against phosphorylated NF-H induced neurite retraction in cell treated with dbcAMP for 3 d; a monoclonal antibody (SMI-32) directed against nonphosphorylated NF-H did not induce neurite retraction at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, none of the above antisera induced retraction of neurites in cells treated with dbcAMP for 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurites develop resistance to retraction by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, first detectable in some neurites after 3 d and in the majority of neurites after 7 d of dbcAMP treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether or not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was compromised by intracellular delivery of the above antisera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> treatment resulted in rapid neurite retraction after intracellular delivery of antisera directed against extensively phosphorylated NF-H, MAP1B, or tau into cells that had previously been treated with dbcAMP for 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was not compromised by the intracellular delivery of antisera directed against NF-L, NF-M, or tubulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings support previous studies indicating that MT polymerization mediates certain aspects of axonal neurite outgrowth and suggest that NFs do not directly participate in these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings further suggest that NFs function in stabilization of the axonal cytoskeleton, apparently by interactions among NFs and MTs that are mediated by NF-H and MAPs </plain></SENT>
