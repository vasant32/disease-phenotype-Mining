<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously isolated agosterol A (AG-A) from a marine Spongia sp. and found that it completely reversed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (Pgp)-over-expressing KB-C2 cells and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> resistance in multidrug-resistance protein (MRP)1-over-expressing CV60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a tri-deacetylated derivative of AG-A (IAG-A) showed almost no activity in reversing Pgp- or MRP1-mediated drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which AG-A reverses MRP1-mediated drug resistance by investigating the interaction between agosterols and MRP1 in MRP1-over-expressing human KB <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (KB/MRP) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">Leukotriene C4</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi>), [3H]-2,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8927">dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione</z:chebi> uptake into membrane vesicles prepared from KB/MRP cells and intracellular [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> accumulation and efflux in KB/MRP cells were measured with or without AG-A and/or inactive IAG-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AG-A reduced MRP1-mediated [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi> transport in a dose-dependent manner, but IAG-A did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition by AG-A was competitive, with a K(i) value of 31 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AG-A at 10 microM enhanced the accumulation of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> in KB/MRP cells to the level of that in control cells in the absence of the agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, ATP-dependent efflux of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> from KB/MRP cells was enhanced compared with KB-3-1 cells and inhibited by AG-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, AG-A reduced intracellular levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, a compound required for MRP1-mediated transport of some anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that AG-A reverses MRP1-mediated drug resistance by directly inhibiting the capacity of MRP1 to transport drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the capacity of AG-A to reduce cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> levels may contribute to the modulating activity of MRP1 </plain></SENT>
