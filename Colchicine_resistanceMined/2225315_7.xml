<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The synthetic <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> ET-18-OCH3 and BM41.440 and a derivative, hexadecylphosphocholine, were tested for inhibition of [3H]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake into a Chinese hamster ovarian cell line (AUXBl) and its multidrug-resistant subline selected for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance (CHRC5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three compounds against the multidrug-resistant subline was equal to or higher than that against the parent line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same result was found for their activity against a human leukemic lymphoblastic cell line (CEM/O) and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>-resistant subline (CEM/MTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two multidrug-resistant cell lines selected for resistance to Adriamycin, the mouse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line P388/ADR and the murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cell line S180/ADR, expressed modest cross-resistance to the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> as measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments performed using the trypan-blue dye-exclusion assay yielded comparable results, although this system revealed a slightly different sensitivity in showing the cytotoxicity of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By this assay, modest cross-resistance for ET-18-OCH3 and BM41.440 to Adriamycin was found only after 24 h incubation and decreased after 48 h incubation, with almost equal sensitivity to both drugs being shown by the parental (P388/W) and resistant lines (P388/ADR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, findings from a human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cloning assay were in accordance with these data, although they did not indicate cross-resistance for the P388/ADR cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that certain <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and derivatives might represent valuable anticancer drugs warranting further study in the setting of resistant disease </plain></SENT>
