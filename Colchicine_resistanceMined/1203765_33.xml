<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Independent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant (CHR) mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells displaying reduced permeability to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> have been isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A distinguishing feature of these membrane-altered mutants is their pleiotropic cross-resistance to a variety of unrelated compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic characterization of the CHR lines indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and cross-resistance to other drugs are of a dominant nature in somatic cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>Revertants</z:mp> of CHR have been isolated which display decreased resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and a corresponding decrease in resistance to other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and the pleiotropic cross-resistance are the result of the same mutation(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies indicate that although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> is transported into our cells by passive diffusion, no major alterations in the membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> could be detected in mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there appears to be an energy-dependent process in these cells which actively maintains a permeability barrier against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CHR cells might be altered in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> has been identified in mutant cell membranes which is not present in parental cells, and is greatly reduced in <z:mp ids='MP_0003171'>revertant</z:mp> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A model for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance is proposed which suggests that certain membrane proteins such as the new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> of CHR cells, are modulators of membrane fluidity (mmf proteins) whose molecular conformation regulates membrane permeability to a variety of compounds and that the CHR mutants are altered in their mmf proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible importance of the CHR cells as models for investigating aspects of chemotherapy related to drug resistance is discussed </plain></SENT>
