<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a series of two-gene and bicistronic retroviral vectors that use the human MDR1 gene as a selectable marker for the overexpression of a second heterologous gene in transduced cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vectors use Harvey murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus sequences for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> expression and packaging functions and include sites for cloning foreign genes of interest under the control of either an internal promoter (two-gene vectors) or an internal ribosome entry site (bicistronic vectors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize these vectors, we used neo as a reporter gene for foreign gene expression and as an independently selectable marker for comparison with MDR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each of the vector constructions supported high-titer retrovirus production and transduction of mouse and human cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using MDR1-neo virus supernatants in parallel titering assays, we found that titers based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance were 10- to 20-fold lower than titers based on G418 resistance, suggesting that MDR1 is a more stringent selectable marker than neo in NIH 3T3 and KB-3-1 cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas neo gene expression with the two-gene vectors was subject to host-specific limitations on internal promoter activity, the bicistronic vectors were highly active in three cell lines tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In K562 cells, using the bicistronic vector, selection with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> led to at least 20-fold higher expression of the MDR1 gene product than did selection with G418, suggesting that the stringent MDR1 selection system is very efficient for obtaining overexpression of foreign genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retroviral vectors carrying MDR1 as a selectable marker plus a second, heterologous gene of interest could have widespread utility for in vitro and in vivo applications of gene transfer technology, including gene therapy </plain></SENT>
