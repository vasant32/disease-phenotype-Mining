<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> is a mainstay of treatment in familial Mediterranean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e>); however, 5%-10% of patients do not respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">Adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1 or MDR1) is a drug transporter that extrudes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> out of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABCB1 gene 3435C to T polymorphism has been demonstrated to alter MDR1 expression in mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, the amount of MDR1 in mononuclear cells may alter response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between MDR1 3435C to T polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (n = 120) were examined for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABCB1 gene 3435C to T genotypes were determined to analyze associations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were evaluated as responders and 22 as nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distributions of ABCB1 CC, CT, and TT genotypes were significantly different between responsive and nonresponsive groups (chi-square = 6.86, p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was significantly higher in patients harboring the C allele than in patients with TT genotype (odds ratio 9.71, 95% CI 1.58-58.76) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> dose to prevent remission was significantly lower in the TT group compared with subjects with the C allele (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study revealed an association between 3435C to T polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> response in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with the TT genotype for the ABCB1 3435C to T variant responded better to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in terms of treatment efficacy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> dose requirements </plain></SENT>
