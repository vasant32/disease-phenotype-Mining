<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) may be associated with the expression of the MDR1 gene which encodes the 170-kDa cell surface P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (PGP) acting as an energy-dependent multidrug efflux pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pump can be inhibited by a variety of drugs including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Substrate specificity of the MDR1 gene product can be altered by a point mutation at amino acid residue 185 in which valine is substituted for glycine, but the effect of this mutation on inhibition of PGP is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multidrug-resistant NIH3T3 cells transfected with the MDR1 retroviral vector pHaMDR-1/A (G185) or pHaMDR1/A (V185) expressing comparable levels of PGP were compared for patterns of drug resistance and inhibition of drug resistance by <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> reversing agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NIH-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-G185 transfectants were somewhat preferentially resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi>, and vinblastine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutant (V185) conferred increased resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> phenotype in both NIH-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-G185- and NIH-<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-V185-transfected NIH3T3 cells was overcome by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">quinidine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">Verapamil</z:chebi> was the most potent of the three agents affecting <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> PGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, specific inhibitors showed different potency with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant transporters, depending on the cytotoxic drug whose resistance was being reversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For example, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, was a powerful reverser of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance for the mutant drug transporter, but was much less effective for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> transporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> reversed resistance to vinblastine more efficiently for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> transporter than for the mutant transporter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the sensitivity of a multidrug transporter to a reversing agent will depend on the reversing agent, the cytotoxic drug, and the presence or absence of mutations which alter substrate specificity </plain></SENT>
