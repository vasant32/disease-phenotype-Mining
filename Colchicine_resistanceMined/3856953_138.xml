<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these selection steps resulted in cross-resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi>, vinblastine, adriamycin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">puromycin</z:chebi>; however, at the highest levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, increased cross-resistance to other drugs was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no major change in protein synthesis or alteration in protein phosphorylation or [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5417">glucosamine</z:chebi> labeling patterns accompanying the development of multiple drug resistance as measured by analysis of metabolically labeled proteins on <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> gels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell-cell hybridization experiments showed that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant and multiple drug-resistant phenotypes were incompletely dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was found to segregate independently from resistance to other drugs in one somatic cell hybrid, suggesting that complex genetic loci are involved in the development of the multiple drug-resistant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These mutants should be useful for the study of the clinically important problem of multiple drug resistance in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
