<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of the decrease of the drug resistance was the same in 6 independent cultures obtained from the inoculum of 200 cells and in control cultures propagated by large quantities of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data coincide with the results of the previous studies of lower level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both studies the frequency of the occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistant variants in selective medium was about 2.10(-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data are consistent with the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance of mouse L cells is not due to a gene mutation </plain></SENT>
