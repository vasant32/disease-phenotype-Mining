<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A mouse cell line, B-82CH/CAP, with three genetic markers - resistance to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (5-BUdR), due to the deficiency in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> kinase (TK); resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, due to a decrease in membrane permeability to the drug; and resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP), was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The capacity of cytoplasts and karyoplasts prepared from this cell line, to transfer resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and CAP was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasts prepared from B-82CH/CAP cells were fused to karyoplasts prepared either from the mouse L or hamster DM-15 cell line, both of which are sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and to CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hybrid cells were resistant to CAP, but sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when karyoplasts prepared from B-82CH/CAP cells were fused to cytoplasts prepared from L cells, the hybrids retained the capacity to proliferate in the medium containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and 5-BUdR, but were greatly reduced in their ability to grow in the medium containing CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the resistance of B-82CH/CAP cells to CAP can be cytoplasmically transmitted and, as in other CAP-resistant cell lines, is probably due to a mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in membrane permeability associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance appear to be determined by the nucleus </plain></SENT>
