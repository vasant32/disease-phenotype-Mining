<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated a &gt; 2-fold increase in neurofilaments and indicated that neurofilaments were phosphorylated to a similar extent in the presence and absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vimentin immunoreactivity, which undergoes down-regulation during dbcAMP-mediated differentiation, was not increased by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> did not induce the precocious appearance of delayed phosphate-dependent neurofilament <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> suggesting that it did not induce the activation of additional neurofilament kinases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NF-H subunits from cytoskeletons of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-treated cells were less susceptible to degradation by an endogenous calcium-dependent protease, providing a possible mechanism for neurofilament accumulation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> decreased axonal neurite microtubules, and eliminated stabilized (acetylated) axonal microtubules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> treatment at earlier times prevented and reversed neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite increased deposition of phosphorylated neurofilaments, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> did not hasten the development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance to neurites, suggesting that stabilization of the axonal cytoskeletal lattice requires neurofilament-microtubule interaction </plain></SENT>
