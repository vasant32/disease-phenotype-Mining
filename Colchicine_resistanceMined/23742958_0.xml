<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Still, many issues-e.g.: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> dosage adjustment, maximum dosage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in children and adults, definition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, alternative treatment solutions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant patients, and genetic screening for asymptomatic siblings-have not yet been standardized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current paper aims at summarizing consensus recommendations to approach these issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review concerning these practical management questions was performed through PubMed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this analysis, expert recommendations were developed during a consensus meeting of caregivers from France and Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A patient experiencing more than four <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> attacks a year needs <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> dose adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In case of persistent attacks (â‰¥6 per year) in patients with maximum doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (2mg in children; 3mg in adults), alternative treatment to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> with IL1 inhibitors should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Routine genetic testing for MEFV mutations in asymptomatic siblings of an index case is not recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is a first attempt to resolve practical questions in the daily management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FMF</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
