<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The new non-immunosuppressive cyclosporin derivative SDZ PSC 833 (PSC) is a potent agent used to overcome typical multidrug resistance (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) associated with overexpression of the mdr1 gene encoding for a P-170 glycoprotein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the efficacy of PSC as compared with cyclosporin was determined in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines exhibiting different levels of resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 10 micrograms/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low concentrations of PSC (8.2 nM) increased the cytotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in cell lines expressing low levels of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration resulting in 50% cell survival (LC50 value) found for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> alone or in combination with PSC in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-A3 cell line that was resistant to 100 ng <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>/ml decreased from greater than 500 to 200 ng/ml at 8.2 nM PSC and to less than 100 ng/ml at 82 and 820 nM PSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>-A3 cell line that was resistant to 200 ng <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>/ml, the LC50 values decreased from greater than 500 ng/ml for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> alone to 500 ng/ml for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> used in combination with 8.2 nM PSC and to less than 100 ng/ml for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> combined with 82 or 820 nM PSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a concentration of 82 nM PSC, the maximal effect in <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> reversal was observed in the cell lines exhibiting moderate resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the highly resistant cell line, PSC (820 nM) also reversed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In drug-accumulation experiments, we obtained a 4-fold increase in intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> accumulation using 820 nM PSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A comparison of PSC with cyclosporin revealed that a cyclosporin concentration 20-fold that of PSC was required to obtain the same sensitising effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data, it may be concluded that PSC is a most promising chemosensitiser </plain></SENT>
