<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated specific cytogenetic alterations accompanying development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in the J774.2 murine cell line and in two sublines (J7.Cl-30 and J7.Cl-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although gene amplification is not observed in the parental J774.2 cell line, a approximately 35-fold amplification of the gene for p-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (mdr) was noted in the J7.Cl-30 subline (770-fold CLCR) and a approximately 70-fold amplification in the J7.Cl-100 subline (2500-fold CLCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the localization and organization of the mdr gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant (CLCR) J7.Cl-30 subline, the p-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> domain was observed to reside on differently sized extrachromosomal elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate not only circular extrachromosomal elements but also linear extrachromosomal elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), the sizes of the extrachromosomal elements were shown to be greater than 2,500 kilobase-pairs (kb), 800 kb, and 400 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the J7.Cl-100 subline was characterized by the presence of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have noted that with increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance the extrachromosomal elements are replaced by HSRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings of linear elements that appear to be precursors of HSRs may offer a new way to interpret different theories of extrachromosomal gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The J7.Cl-30 cell line presents a unique system to analyze further the formation and structure of extrachromosomal elements </plain></SENT>
