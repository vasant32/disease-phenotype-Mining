<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The higher CH resistance was associated with the elevated functional activity of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (Pgp) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The constitutive level of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> hydroxylase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34480">7-ethoxyresorufin</z:chebi> O-deethylase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> P-4501A-dependent activities) were the same in sublines with different CH resistance levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, benzo(a)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="35298">anthracene</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> P-4501A inducing agent, more effectively induced <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> hydroxylase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34480">7-ethoxyresorufin</z:chebi> O-deethylase activities in sublines with elevated P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The toxicity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi>, a compound which is simultaneously a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> P-4501A-inducing agent and a toxic agent activated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> P-4501A, is more effective in sublines with elevated CH resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results support the suggestion about the coordinated regulation of enzyme systems involved in the defence against various lipophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
