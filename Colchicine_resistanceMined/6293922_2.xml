<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Small chromatin bodies (SCB) were revealed in Djungarian hamster cells resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They looked like single bodies or like clusters of small particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SCB were localized both in nucleus and cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar formations were earlier observed in oocytes of insects with amplified extrachromosomal rDNA genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA in the SCB was able to replicate not only during the S phase but also during other phases of the cell cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The restriction analysis showed that in cells with SCB DNA amplified sequences were replicated autonomously too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that SCB in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant cells contain amplified genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Besides, SCB double-minute chromosomes (DMs) were observed in some resistant sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one of them, DMs were the only karyotypic alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relationship between SCB, chromosomal homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) and DMs was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Single SCB and DMs appeared at the early stage of the development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance (the level of drug resistance is 16-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selection of variants 170-220-fold resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> was usually accompanied by the decrease in the cell number with SCB and DMs and by the increase in the amount of cells containing the chromosomes with HSRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the further enhancement of drug resistance (700-750), some decrease in the number of cells with HSRs and the appearance of the great number of cells containing large groups of SCB were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance observed during cultivation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> free medium was accompanied by the disappearance of HSRs, emergence of SCB and DMs and further elimination of SCB and DMs from cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The quantity of autonomously replicating amplified DNA fragments after digestive by HindIII was increased with the enhancement of SCB number in cultures </plain></SENT>
