<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Development of resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in the mouse macrophage-like cell line J774.2 coincides with the expression of a variety of phenotypic traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cloned subline (J7/CLC-20), maintained in 20 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, exhibits reduced steady-state association with drug, increased presence of a 140,000-145,000 dalton (140-145 kD) phosphoglycoprotein associated with the plasma membrane, double minute chromosomes and cross-resistance to other drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While similar phenotypic traits are observed in J774.2 cells resistant to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="45863">taxol</z:chebi> and vinblastine, differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of the resistance-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17089">glycoproteins</z:chebi> in each of the three sublines suggest that multi-drug resistant sublines exhibit specificity for individual drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to elucidate the relationships between the phenotypic traits associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, the degree of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in J7/CLC-20 cells was modulated and the levels of expression of the phenotypic traits were quantitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in the growth medium, J7/CLC-20 cells reverted to drug sensitivity within 35 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decrease in the level of resistance coincided with coordinate changes in both the quantity of the resistance-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and the average number of double minute chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that the emergence and disappearance of the resistance-specific <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and double minute chromosomes may be closely linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, J7/CLC-20 cells which had regained their drug sensitivity after growth in drug-free medium maintained a reduced level of steady-state drug association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The persistence of reduced drug association in cells that have reverted to a drug-sensitive state suggests that this phenomenon, although related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, need not be the primary or only mechanism of drug resistance </plain></SENT>
