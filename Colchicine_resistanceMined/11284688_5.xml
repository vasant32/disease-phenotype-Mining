<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The multidrug transporter P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (Pgp) is an ATPase efflux pump for multiple cytotoxic agents, including vinblastine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found that resistance to vinblastine but not to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in cell lines derived from different types of tissues and expressing the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> human Pgp correlates with the Pgp density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vinblastine induces a conformational change in Pgp, evidenced by increased reactivity with a conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibody UIC2, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the tested cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> increases the UIC2 reactivity in only some of the cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In those lines where <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> alone did not affect UIC2 reactivity, this drug was, however, able to reverse the vinblastine-induced increase in UIC2 reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the increase in UIC2 reactivity in the presence of saturating concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> correlates with the relative ability of Pgp to confer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in different cell lines, suggesting the existence of some cell-specific factors that have a coordinate effect on the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> to induce conformational transitions and to be transported by Pgp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi>, like vinblastine, reverses the decrease in UIC2 reactivity produced by nonhydrolyzable <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, but unlike vinblastine, it does not reverse the effect of ATP at a high concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi>, however, decreases the Hill number for the effect of ATP on the UIC2 reactivity from 2 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> increases the UIC2 reactivity and reverses the effect of ATP in ATPase-deficient Pgp mutants, but not in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> Pgp expressed in the same cellular background, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis counteracts the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> on the Pgp conformation </plain></SENT>
