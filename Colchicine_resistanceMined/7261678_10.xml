<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two clones of Djungarian hamster cells, an HSR was located in the long arm of chromosome 4; in another Djungarian hamster cell line and in mouse L-53 cells, and HSR was located in unidentified marker chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During cultivation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> free medium these cells lost their resistance at the rate of 2--3 x 10(-2) cells per population doubling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of resistance was accompanied by the disappearance of the HSR and emergence of possible double minutes (dmins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance is the result of gene amplification and support the idea that dmins may be derived from the HSR in these systems </plain></SENT>
