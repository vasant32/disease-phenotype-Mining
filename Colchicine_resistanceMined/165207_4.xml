<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resistant cells do not appear to be true mutants, since they appear at a high frequency, unaffected by treatment with ethyl <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> sulphonate, and are unstable in the absence of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are cross-resistant to other drugs, show a reduced rate of binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> in monolayer, and give extracts with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-binding properties identical to those of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the resistance is due to a permeability barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The naturally occurring resistance of the Syrian hamster line is specific for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, and may be due to a specific permeability barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Syrian hamster line is also shown to have an extra <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-binding pool </plain></SENT>
