<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluctuation tests showed that the generation of drug-resistant variants in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> population was random and did not depend on the action of the selective agent </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> resistance proved to be relatively unstable: it was 2--3-fold less in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones propagated in non-selective conditions for 25--33 days </plain></SENT>
