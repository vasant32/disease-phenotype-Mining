<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The karyotype of mouse B-82CH-9 and B-82CH-9/CAP cell lines as well as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in somatic cell hybrids were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found earlier that these cell lines differ from other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant mouse and Djungarian hamster cell lines in stability of drug resistance and the lack of overproduction of the p22 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis of chromosomes stained by trypsin G-banding technique showed that, unlike mouse L-53 cells possessing unstable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance, the B-82CH-9 and its B-82CH-9/CAP derivative had neither chromosomes with long homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) nor other cytological manifestations of gene amplification, such as double-minute chromosomes and small chromatin bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hybrids of B-82CH-9/CAP and sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> Djungarian hamster DM-15 cells appeared in the HAT medium 10-fold more frequently than in the HAT medium containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hybrids grown in the HAT medium had complete chromosome complements of parent cells, while hybrids isolated from the medium with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> lacked some Djungarian hamster and mouse chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4 independent clones and the cell line originated from the mixture of about 100 clones grown in HAT medium were sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We failed to transfer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance with B-82CH-9/CAP microcells, while they were able to transfer HPRT+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the same time, microcells of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DM2</z:e>/1 cells, possessing unstable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance connected with gene amplification, could transfer both TK+ and resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance of B-82CH-9 is suppressed in somatic cell hybrids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stability of the trait, the absence of cytological manifestations of gene amplification, the lack of overproduction of p22 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> and recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance in these cells is not connected with gene amplification but rather results from another genetic alteration, possibly, gene mutation </plain></SENT>
