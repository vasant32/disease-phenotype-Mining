<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(Laredo isolate) that is most apparent when the drug is applied during the initiation of cultures at a concentration of 7.5 mM or higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continued transfer of cultures in medium containing progressively increasing concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> has resulted in a variant that grows prolifically in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (7.5 mM) with a generation time comparable to that of the parent stock, Comparison of a number of parameters of the 2 variants revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was accompanied by a change in cell shape, a reduced membrane permeability, which could partially be overcome by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO), and a reduced tolerance to osmotic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the parent strain and resistant variant were equally susceptible to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27641">cycloheximide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">puromycin</z:chebi> suggesting that the acquired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance may not be explained on the basis of an entirely unspecific generalized reduced ability for drug uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">Colchicine</z:chebi> resistance and altered structure were found to be stable over a long period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible interdependence of these 2 parameters and their relation to cell motility in Entamoeba sp. are discussed </plain></SENT>
