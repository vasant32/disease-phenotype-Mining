<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the long 5' untranslated region of encephalomyocarditis virus as translational enhancer of the second gene, a bicistronic unit composed of cDNA for human P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> [the product of the multidrug resistance gene, MDR1 (also called PGY1)] as selectable marker and cDNA for human glucocerebrosidase (GC; EC 3.2.1.45) (a membrane-associated lysosomal hydrolase) was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NIH 3T3 cells transfected with a Harvey murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> virus retroviral vector carrying this bicistronic cassette (pHaMCG) express active P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and GC and expression of both proteins augments coordinately with selection for increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Percoll gradient analysis of homogenates showed that GC was targeted to the lysosomal fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability to select for expression of GC with natural product drugs after introduction of the pHaMCG retroviral vector may be useful in gene therapy strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gaucher disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
