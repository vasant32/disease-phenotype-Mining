<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The series of sublines 170-750 times more resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were obtained from 10 independent clones of Djungarian hamster cells possessing 16-22-fold resistance to the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From each clone, several sublines with different levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance were developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug resistance was unstable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2,7-4,0% of cells per population doubling lost resistance to selective dosages of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The loss of resistance was stepwise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes stained by trypsin G-banding technique were studied in 17 sublines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>15 sublines derived from 9 independent clones contained chromosomes with long homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These were, as a rule, primarily localized in the long arm of chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During cultivation, HSRs were transferred from chromosome 4 into other chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Evidently, transposition of HSRs was due to translocations of different chromosomes of HSRs in the chromosome 4 and to subsequent breakages of the resulting dicentrics within HSRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A great number of different chromosomal rearrangements was also found in the cells containing HSRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Possibly, formation of HSR leads to destabilization of the karyotype and to the variability of the genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The length of HSRs varied in different cells of each subline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance in different sublines did not correlate with the average length of HSRs in their cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The lack of connection between the lengths of HSRs and the levels of drug resistance as well as the existence of highly resistant sublines with gene amplification, but without HSRs, suggest that amplified genes are localized in Djungarian hamster <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant cells both in chromosomes and extrachromosomally </plain></SENT>
