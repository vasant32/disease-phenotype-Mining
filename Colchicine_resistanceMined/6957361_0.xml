<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two new Djungarian hamster cell lines which are resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clonal DMCAP subline was obtained by incubation of HPRT-deficient DM-15 cells for 6 months in the medium containing 50 micron/ml of CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resistance to CAP is determined in DMCAP cells by the cytoplasm: cytoplasts from these cells could transmit resistance to CAP into sensitive cells, such as L or DMCH-2/1 cells by hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, after transplantation of DMCAP nuclei into L cytoplasts, the resulting hybrid cells lost resistance to CAP to a great extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the capacity of DMCAP cytoplasts to transfer CAP-resistance, we obtained a line of hybrids (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DMCAP X DMCH-2/1) which was resistant to 8-azaguanine, CAP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As in the original DMCH-2/1 cell line, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance in the cybrid line appeared to be associated with gene amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, chromosomal analysis showed that the karyotype of the hybrids was identical to that of DMCH-2/1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both contained marker chromosomes with homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) and, during incubation in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-free medium, lost resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The loss of resistance was accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells containing chromosomes with HSRs and an increase in the number with double minutes (DMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Many cells containing small chromatin bodies in their cytoplasm also appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These chromatin bodies may be DMs lost from the nucleus during mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These new sublines with cytoplasmic and nuclear genetic markers may be useful in the further study of cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions, particularly, in the analysis of possible activities of the DNA fragments which appear in the cytoplasm during reversion to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> sensitivity </plain></SENT>
