<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes stained by trypsin G-banding technique were studied in five Djungarian hamster cell sublines, resistant to different concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells of two independent sublines, approximately 13 times more resistant to the drug, an additional material on the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 3 was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The size and banding pattern of this new material were different in two sublines and in individual cells of each subline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In cells, which were 25-fold resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, the additional material was found both in the short arm of chromosome 3 and in the long arm of chromosome 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some cells the additional material in chromosome 4 contained the long homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subline which was 100-fold resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cells had the chromosome 4 bearing the long HSR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The further increase in the level of drug resistance (300-fold) was accompanied by the increase in the size of HSRs in chromosome 4, the appearance of the second HSR in the short arm of chromosome 3 and emergence of small chromatin bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 4 and a low level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>-resistance arises more frequently than in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-sensitive cells bearing two chromosomes 4, or in cells possessing the high level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> of the short arm of chromosome 4 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The similarities and differences of karyotypic alterations accompanying the development of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>-resistance in Djungarian hamster cells, are discussed </plain></SENT>
