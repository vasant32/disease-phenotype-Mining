<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new mouse cell line B-82CH(R)-9 is described, which is 25-fold more resistant to the cytotoxic action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> than the known lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug resistance of this cell line originates from the decreased plasmic membrane permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This follows from several facts: 1) 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> uptake by intact resistant cells is decreased 5-10-fold; 2) the binding of labeled <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> by extracts of resistant cells is unchanged; 3) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistant cells are cross-resistant to the drugs which are not active in binding the microtubular protein tubulin: the uptake of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17939">puromycin</z:chebi> and 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> B is decreased 2.1 and 2.5-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistant mouse cell lines obtained earlier, the drug resistance of B-82CH(R)-9 cells is stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After cultivation without a selective agent for 3 and 6 months the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
