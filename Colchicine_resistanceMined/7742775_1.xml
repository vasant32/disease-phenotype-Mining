<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mixtures of CH-resistant and CH-sensitive cells as well as control unmixed cells were propagated for 3 days and the sensitivity of the cells to CH was measured by colony forming assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of individual subpopulations was possible due to genetic marker (6TG-resistance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The data show that the survival of CH-sensitive cells in CH-supplemented medium increased after co-cultivation with CH-resistant counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To measure Pgp activity the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">RH123</z:chebi> and FACScan analysis were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pgp-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8828">RH123</z:chebi> efflux increased after co-cultivation of CH-sensitive and CH-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
