<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This uptake was stimulated several fold by metabolic inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activation energy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> uptake was found to be 19 kcal per <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027962,C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mole</z:e>; a similar value was obtained in cells stimulated by <z:chebi fb="53" ids="17514">cyanide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug resistant mutants with greatly reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> permeability have been isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They displayed a pleiotropic phenotype, being cross-resistant to a variety of unrelated compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The basis of this pleiotropy was due also to reduced drug permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Examination of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and fatty acids of parental and mutant cell membranes revealed no major differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, a 170,000 dalton surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was observed to be associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> was postulated to be a modulator of drug permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these data are consistent with the concept that mammalian cells are able to regulate the permeation of drugs entering by an unmediated diffusion process </plain></SENT>
