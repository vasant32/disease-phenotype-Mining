<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The drug resistance pattern of mdr1-transfected clones includes relatively high resistance to gramicidin D (about 300-fold), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (about 100-fold), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> (about 100-fold) and a lower degree of resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (about 10-fold), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP16</z:chebi>-213 (about 10-fold), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> (about 6-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transfectants did not exhibit resistance to trimetrexate, cis-<z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>, G418, or magainin-2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>; they were slightly more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (2-fold) but not to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As in other multidrug-resistant cell lines, resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> could be reversed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and, more effectively, by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">Chloroquine</z:chebi> only marginally increased drug sensitivity in mdr1-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gramicidin D resistance was also reversed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, suggesting that the mechanism of resistance to this <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> antibiotic is similar to that of other drugs transported by P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, expression of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mdr1 complementary DNA induces a drug-resistant phenotype similar to that induced by mdr1 complementary DNAs isolated from drug-resistant cell lines with relatively low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As other cell lines may display a different pattern of drug resistance, it is clear that other resistance mechanisms or cell type-specific factors may modulate the resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>mdr1-transfected cell lines provide a convenient tool for the identification of P-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-mediated phenomena </plain></SENT>
