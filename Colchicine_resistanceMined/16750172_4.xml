<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe some new <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> derivatives, which possess strong in vitro MDR1 inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of the compounds on the MDR1 mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51903">calcein</z:chebi>-AM efflux, ATPase activity, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was proven by microplate assays and flow cytometry using recombinant and control cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of these derivatives were more active than <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and one of them was at least as active as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to our results the new structural elements built in these <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> type compounds increased their MDR1 inhibitory activity, which may serve as a basis of the development of an effective MDR1 inhibitor drug </plain></SENT>
