<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two new sublines of Djungarian hamster cells DM-15CHR-1/1 and DM-15CHR-1/5 which are 170--190-fold resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> as compared to the initial DM-15 cells have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Drug resistance of these cells is unstable: in nonselective conditions the trait is lost at a rate approximately 2.10(-2) per cell per generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cells of the two independently derived clonal sublines have the same karyotypic alteration: an additional marker chromosome, the derivative of chromosome 4 carrying homogeneously colored region (HCR) in the long arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The size of HCR varies in different cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its average length is about 4--5% of the total length of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cells circular chromosomes or double-minutes were found in addition to the marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They consist of the material similar to that of HCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistance is associated with gene amplification </plain></SENT>
