<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have introduced a single<z:chebi fb="27" ids="29999"> Ser---</z:chebi>-Phe substitution within the predicted TM11 domain of mdr1 (position 941) and mdr3 (position 939) and analyzed the effect of these substitutions on the drug-resistance profiles of these two proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations at this residue drastically altered the overall degree of drug resistance conveyed by mdr1 and mdr3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modulating effect of this mutation on mdr1 and mdr3 varied for the drugs tested: it was very strong for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and adriamycin and moderate for vinblastine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For mdr1, the Ser941----Phe941 substitution produced a unique mutant protein that retained the capacity to confer vinblastine resistance but lost the ability to confer adriamycin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that the predicted TM11 domain of proteins encoded by mdr and mdr-like genes plays an important role in the recognition and transport of their specific substrates </plain></SENT>
