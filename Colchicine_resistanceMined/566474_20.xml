<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each instance, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance was expressed in an incompletely dominant manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some hybrid clones were examined further for the expression of the pleiotropic CHR phenotype and for the cell surface P <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These features of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant phenotype were also expressed coordinately </plain></SENT>
