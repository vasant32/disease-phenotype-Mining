<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A kinetic approach was used to analyze the mechanism by which a substitution of valine for glycine at position 185 in the multidrug transporter alters its substrate specificity so that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> transport is increased, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> transport is unchanged, and vinblastine transport is decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Time courses for uptake and efflux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>, vinblastine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41977">daunorubicin</z:chebi> for NIH/3T3 mouse cells transfected with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (MDR1-G185) and mutant (MDR1-V185) strains of the human mdr1 gene were determined at room temperature in the presence and absence of an energy supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The initial rate of vinblastine uptake was reduced approximately 5-fold by <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> feeding of ATP-depleted <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (MDR1-G185) cells but was only halved in MDR1-V185 transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> feeding decreased the initial rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> uptake approximately 4-fold in the MDR1-V185 (mutant) transfectant but not in the MDR1-G185 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) transfectant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efflux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> was accelerated &gt; 5-fold in both the MDR1-V185 (mutant) and MDR1-G185 (<z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>) transfectants when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was given to raise ATP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effects on initial rates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> uptake accounted semiquantitatively for the increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> resistance of MDR1-V185 (mutant) transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar effects were found for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> in the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>-V185 transfectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28593">Quinidine</z:chebi> in the external medium greatly inhibited drug entry rates but had little effect on efflux, whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> inhibited both uptake and efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A possible interpretation of these data is that the multidrug transporter extracts drugs from the external and internal halves of the membrane bilayer by different paths, which are distinguishable by mutation and inhibitors </plain></SENT>
