<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied amino acid up-take from incubation media by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-sensitive Djungarian hamster fibroblast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that arginine and asparagine amino acid contents in the medium are different for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-sensitive and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi>-resistant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Amino acids concentration is not reduced in the medium after incubation of resistant cells, while it is decreased after incubation of sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We can suggest that penetration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low-weight</z:hpo> sources of nitrogen into sensitive cells is hampered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It can also be suggested that protein macromolecules are the main source of nitrogen for these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protein up-take levels from the incubation medium, as assessed by the ammonia and amino acid contents of cell counts don't exceed 5% of their initial concentrations in the medium </plain></SENT>
