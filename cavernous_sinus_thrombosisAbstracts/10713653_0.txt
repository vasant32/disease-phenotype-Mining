There are many treatment methods for lupus nephritis, including high-dose steroids, pulse methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide therapy. In cyclophosphamide therapy, there can be some side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and infection. We report on a case receiving a combination of high dose steroid and intravenous cyclophosphamide. Following this, she developed a fever and a protruding right eye, and septic cavernous sinus thrombosis was diagnosed. This complication had never been reported in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, and related literature is reviewed.
