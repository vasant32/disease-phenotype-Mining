We report three cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis and compare the values of three imaging methods: orbital phlebography, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the other hand, we performed 2D "time of flight" MRI flow sequences on a series of subjects with normal cavernous sinus. Visualization of cavernous veins in all subjects by this method makes it possible to consider using it for the diagnosis of undoubtedly cavernous sinus thrombosis in all safety. MRI-angiography, therefore, may replace orbital phlebography.
