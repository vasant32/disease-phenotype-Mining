The authors describe a case of ulcerative colitis initially complicated by priapism due to cavernous sinus thrombosis and by prostatic plexus thrombosis and, subsequently, by a fatal acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis. This complex and, apparently, until now unreported association supports the view that ulcerative colitis is the expression of a systemic disease. It also raises important pathogenetic problems which are discussed in connection with the vascular complications of ulcerative colitis reported in the literature.
