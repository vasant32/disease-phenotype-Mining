A case of acute orbital cellulitis in an adolescent girl is reported and compared with ten cases treated in the same hospital in recent years. The clinical features and stages of orbital cellulitis and its differentiation from cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis is discussed. Although these complications are nowadays rare with modern chemotherapy and antibiotics, they may still occasionally result in blindness and death. (Duke-Elder et al., 1974).
