Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare complication of facial infections, particularly of the dangerous triangle (nose and upper lip) and less often of the orbit, middle ear, pharynx or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus is the most frequent causative agent. Prompt diagnosis and early aggressive antibiotic therapy, with or without anticoagulants, is required. A 49-year-old woman developed this complication following multiple nasal abscesses. Despite intensive antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy she became permanently blind. We present this case to stress the fact that this disease is still fraught with high morbidity, and even mortality.
