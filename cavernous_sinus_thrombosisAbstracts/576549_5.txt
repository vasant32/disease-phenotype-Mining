Occlusion or thrombosis of the superior ophthalmic vein or of the cavernous sinus is an unspecific finding that may be secondary to different disorders such as tumours of the skull base or nasopharynx. Sometimes, however, no underlying disorder is found in spite of an extensive clinical and radiological evaluation. Eight such cases are here presented. Similar cases have previously been described, both as examples of the Tolosa-Hunt syndrome and as aseptic cavernous sinus thrombosis. The literature on these two disorders is reviewed and different diagnostic criteria discussed.
