Eight cases with phlebographic appearances consistent with aseptic thrombosis of the cavernous sinus or of the posterior part of the superior ophthalmic vein are presented. The clinical course is briefly described and the phlebographic findings and possible differential diagnoses discussed. Even if recent methods may obviate the need for phlebography in the demonstration of orbital tumors in certain cases, the possibility of intraorbital or cavernous sinus thrombosis constitutes an important indication for phlebography.
