Intracranial complications of sinusitis are infrequent since the advent of antibiotics, and furthermore the prognosis is improved by medical therapy. We have seen a patient with an intracranial complication of sinus infection that had a history of frontal bone trauma five years ago. Then following an upper respiratory tract infection, headache, bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, spiking fever, neck stiffness, bilateral chemosis and ophthalmoplegy developed. Cavernous sinus thrombosis was diagnosed clinically and high doses of I.V. antibiotics were started promptly. The patient's condition improved in the first week of her admission. She was discharged three weeks later, without any surgical intervention. Two-year follow up showed no cranial nerve palsies or any neurologic deficiencies. A good result has been achieved by immediate medical measures.
