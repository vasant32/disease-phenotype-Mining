Three cases of acute necrosis of a hypophyseal adenoma are reported with a review of the medical literature. The clinical presentation as an acute parasellar compression syndrome was the result of aseptic meningitis in 2 cases and of cavernous sinus thrombosis in the other; the usual symptoms of headaches, oculomotor paralysis and impairment of consciousness were observed. The diagnosis was suspected on clinical grounds, by the radiological changes of the pituitary fossa and confirmed by computerised axial tomography. All three patients had a favourable outcome. Surgery was only required in one case with threatening visual complications. Dissociated anterior pituitary deficiency persisted in all cases; two patients also had diabetes insipidus. In one case, the pituitary necrosis stabilised an acromegaly for a two year period.
