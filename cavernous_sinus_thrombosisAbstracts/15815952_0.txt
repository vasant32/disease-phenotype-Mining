Cavernous sinus syndrome (CSS) may be caused by a wide range of pathological process among we include metastatic disease. A case of a woman whose breast neoplasm was initially expressed by a CSS is discussed in this article. We describe a 64-year-old woman with several weeks progressive course of pain and numbness in her left-side facies and occasional diplopia. Neurological examination showed left ptosis, limitation of elevation of left eye and abducens nerve palsy as well as hypoesthesia in the frontal and maxillary regions of her left-side facies. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed the presence of a mass in the orbit and left cavernous sinus. General examination disclosed a sclerotic and retractile lesion in her left breast which involved the nipple suggesting breast carcinoma metastases. The patient underwent a breast fine-needle aspiration biopsy which established the presence of an infiltrating breast carcinoma. This case shows the importance role of the general physical examination to determine the etiology of the CSS. It is necessary and fundamental to perform it on each patient not only to orientate further investigations but also to avoid more invasive diagnostic procedures.
