Sphenoid sinusitis is uncommon, with an incidence of about 2.7%. Failure to diagnose and treat sphenoid sinus disease has been shown to lead to serious neurologic sequellae. Plain radiographs play a limited role in the management of sinusitis. CT scan can provide a positive diagnosis by the visualization of mucosal thickening, air-fluid level and complete opacification of the sinusal cavities. In addition, CT can provide more information about the anatomy and abnormalities of the sphenoid sinus. MRI is used in cases of suspected tumors or neurologic involvement. The most common presenting symptom is headache that arise characteristically, but rarely, from the vertex. Sphenoiditis has a high risk of severe neurologic involvement, cavernous sinus thrombosis being one of the most serious complications.
