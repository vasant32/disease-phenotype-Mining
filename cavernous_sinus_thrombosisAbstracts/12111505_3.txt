The authors describe a case of indirect carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) appearing five months after embolization for traumatic direct CCF, which was treated six months after the trauma. Long-term (six months) venous hypertension to the affected cavernous sinus due to direct CCF and cavernous sinus thrombosis following a balloon embolization were considered as an etiology of the de novo dural arteriovenous fistula. The recurrent symptoms of CCF are usually related to detached balloon disorder, but delayed recurrence may be caused by the de novo dural AVF, if the direct CCF was treated in the chronic state.
