A 55 year old male patient was operated on for a massive and vascular acoustic neurinoma in a sitting position. The tumor was completely excised. Post-operatively, the patient developed irritability and clinical features suggestive of contralateral cavernous sinus thrombosis. CT scan showed air within the dural walls of the cavernous sinus on the side of surgery. However, there was no radiological evidence of cavernous sinus thrombosis on the contralateral side. Cavernous sinus thrombosis as a post-surgery complication has not been reported. Air within the dural confines of the cavernous sinus has also not been observed or radiologically recorded in the literature.
