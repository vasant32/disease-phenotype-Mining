A 51-year-old woman with left proptosis, diplopia, headache, and nausea was found to have bilateral intraorbital abscesses, left superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis, bilateral cavernous sinus thromboses, and a left temporal lobe intracerebral abscess. Because the paranasal sinuses were unaffected, a dental origin was suspected and confirmed. The causative organism was Streptococcus milleri. Aggressive surgical intervention included bilateral orbital abscess drainage and dental extraction, and medical therapy included intravenous metronidazole, ceftriaxone, heparin, and methylprednisolone. A left sixth cranial nerve paresis was the only long-term sequela.
