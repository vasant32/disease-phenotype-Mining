A 34-year-old man developed fever, headache, nausea, double vision, exophthalmus, ptosis, disturbance of vision and oculomotor nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiography led to the clinical diagnoses of cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis and suspicion of bacterial aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery, respectively. Peptostreptococcus was detected in blood culture analysis. He died 15 days after admission. Systemic organs showed several septic changes. In particular, the bilateral cavernous sinuses were enlarged and showed severe neutrophilic leukocyte infiltration of the walls and organization, recanalization and abscesses in thrombi. In anterior to the middle cranial fossa, abscess-forming, necrotic, hemorrhagic meningitis, purulent sphenoid sinusitis, pyogenic osteomyelitis of the sphenoid bone, suppurative encephalitis, and inflammatory necrosis of the hypophysis were seen. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient with cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis caused by sphenoid sinusitis.
