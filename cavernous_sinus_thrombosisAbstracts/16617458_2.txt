Several cranial nerves traverse the cavernous sinus producing the typical symptom complex seen during cavernous venous sinus thrombosis in Mucorales infection. Fungi of the order Entomophthorales display different pathological and histological characteristics although belonging to the same class of fungi. A case is presented, wherein the anatomy of the cavernous sinus forms the basis in explaining the presenting symptoms of a patient with Entomophthorales infection. The anatomical explanation for the presenting neurological symptoms is confirmed by radiological investigations and further supports the diagnosis of Entomophthorales infection.
