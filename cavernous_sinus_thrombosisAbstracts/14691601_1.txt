Adult septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) due to Streptococcus constellatus infection has not been reported. We report a case of CST due to S. constellatus in a 39-year-old man who had typical presentations of septic CST including headache, fever, and ophthalmoplegia, with an evolving course for 10 days before he was sent to our emergency room. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study revealed CST, which was confirmed by cerebral angiography study. Multiple positive blood cultures grew viridans streptococci and further species identification with conventional methods, API-20 STREPT system analysis, and polymerase chain reaction sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA revealed S. constellatus. The presence of sphenoid sinusitis in this patient was also demonstrated by cranial MRI study, and the presence of meningitis by meningeal irritation signs and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings. Chronic alcohol consumption for more than 10 years was the only predisposing condition to this infection. He had a full recovery after 6 weeks of intravenous penicillin G therapy (24 x 10(6) U/day). Almost complete regression of cavernous sinus lesion and resolution of sphenoid sinusitis were shown on follow-up cranial MRI study about 6 months later.
