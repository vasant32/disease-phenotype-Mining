Complications of frontal sinusitis are potentially serious. The best prevention is adequate antibiotic treatment of acute sinusitis or of the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis. Intracranial complications include extradural, subdural and brain abscesses, meningitis and cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis. Bony complications include localized or spreading osteomyelitis. Surgical intervention is often required to prevent unacceptable mortality.
