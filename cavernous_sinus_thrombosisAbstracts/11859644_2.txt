OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to discuss the presenting signs and symptoms important for the early diagnosis and to review the medical and surgical management of patients presenting with intracranial complications of sinusitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of the medical records of all patients admitted with intracranial infections between 1990 and 1999 at the Department of Otolaryngology, Department of Neurosurgery and Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Cluj, Romania. RESULTS: Sixteen patients had 23 intracranial complications of sinusitis. These were meningitis (6 cases), frontal lobe abscess (6 cases), epidural abscess (5 cases), subdural abscess (4 cases), and cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis (2 cases). In almost all patients, early symptoms included headache and fever. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by imaging. Management of these infections included intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, appropriate neurosurgical and sinus drainage. Among these patients, there was one death and 4 patients developed significant neurologic sequelae. Poor prognosis was associated with the presence of subdural abscess and a prolonged time interval between the onset of symptoms and the beginning of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of intracranial complication of sinusitis can reduce morbidity and mortality associated with these complications.
