Cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis is a serious disease. We report herein a case seen in a 9-year-old boy hospitalized for an acute pneumopathy. Clinical signs were made of a diffuse edema of the upper two-thirds of the face, eyelid edema, chemosis, exophthalmia, meningeal syndrome, and infections syndromes associated with alteration of consciousness. A CT scan revealed a heterogenous enhancement and enlargement of the left cavernous sinus and homogenous opacity of the sphenoidal sinuses. Therapeutic management was complicated due to allergy to Î²-lactams and the multidrug resistance of Staphylococcus aureus.
