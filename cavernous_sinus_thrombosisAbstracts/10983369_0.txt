The paper presents the data on 318 patients who visited "Diagnostics" Medical Centre. Among the patients there were 195 women (61%) and 123 men (39%) aged 9-71 years. Somatizated mental pathology was diagnosed in 306 cases. A cohort of the patients examined reflected quite adequately both the frequency and the types of mental pathology, exactly: neurotic, personal, psychotic and organic (somatic). But these patients did not received necessary psychiatric aid. Clinical, cultural and social-psychological causes of this situation are considered. Among such causes there is deterioration of both dispensary and ambulatory-polyclinic psychiatric service.
