Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is rarely seen clinically as a complication of infectious processes since the discovery of penicillin. At the present time, dental abscess is an uncommon cause of CST. We now report our experiences with a 60-year-old diabetic male, who developed CST 38 days after extraction of an infected upper third molar tooth. The importance of eradicating regional cervicofacial foci of infection is stressed.
