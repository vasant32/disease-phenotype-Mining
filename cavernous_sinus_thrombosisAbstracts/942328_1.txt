Unilateral blindness and total ophthalmoplegia developed on the same side on which transantral ligation of the internal maxillary artery was performed for persistent posterior epistaxis. Evaluation with arteriograms and phlebograms showed no compromise of retinal vessels or cavernous sinus thrombosis. At reexploration of the maxillary antrum, marked swelling of previously placed oxidized cellulose gauze was found. An experimental model, using the rabbit, was designed to determine if implantation of oxidized cellulose gauze adjacent to the optic nerve would produce blindness and ophthalmoplegia.
