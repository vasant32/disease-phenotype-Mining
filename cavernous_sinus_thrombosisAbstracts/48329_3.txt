The bone separating the frontal sinus from the anterior cranial fossa and the orbit is often quite thin. This, plus the interrelated venous drainage system of these areas, forms the anatomic basis for serious orbital and intracranial complications that must be recognized early. These include orbital cellulitis and abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, subdural and brain abscess and meningitis. Early hospitalization for intravenous antibiotic therapy and, occasionally, emergency surgical drainage are required.
