Carotid cavernous sinus fistula is an abnormal vascular interconnection between a branch of the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. This is an uncommon complication of craniofacial injuries, as it occurs in only 0.17-0.27% of cases, according to the literature. The differential diagnosis should include superior orbital fissure syndrome, orbital apex syndrome, orbital haematoma and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The case is reported of an 18-year-old white woman who was involved in a motor vehicle accident. Clinical examination revealed only mandibular fractures, with the absence of skull-base, mid-face or any other fractures. Two days after the trauma, her condition deteriorated, and extraocular movements were totally absent. Magnetic resonance angiographic scanning was performed, and a carotid cavernous sinus fistula was found. This was treated by embolization resulting in restoration of eye movement and vision.
