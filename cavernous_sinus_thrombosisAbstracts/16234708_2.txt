A 71-year-old-man presented with chronic left-sided epiphora and a 5-day history of progressive left orbital swelling that had started with a "bump" on the left side of his nose. Orbital CT revealed left-sided preseptal and postseptal inflammation, along with marked thickening of the left superior ophthalmic vein. Orbital MRI with gadolinium enhancement and fat suppression revealed a low-intensity signal in the left superior ophthalmic vein, consistent with a superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis. There was no cavernous sinus involvement. A diagnosis was made of left-sided dacryocystitis-induced orbital cellulitis and superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis. Treatment consisted of intravenous vancomycin, followed by early dacryocystorhinostomy and postoperative intravenous dexamethasone. Anticoagulation was not used. Within 1 week after surgery, the orbital congestion had dramatically improved. Though rare, isolated superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis can be a harbinger of cavernous sinus thrombosis; therefore, early detection is the key to avoiding cavernous sinus thrombosis.
