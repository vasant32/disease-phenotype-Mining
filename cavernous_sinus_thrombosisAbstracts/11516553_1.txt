Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a serious condition, which, if not recognized early, can lead to a fulminant course. Knowledge of risk factors along with early recognition of signs and symptoms may alter the course of this condition. We present a case of a patient with cavernous sinus thrombosis with characteristic findings on MRI. Biopsy of the sinuses revealed mucromycosis as the offending agent.
