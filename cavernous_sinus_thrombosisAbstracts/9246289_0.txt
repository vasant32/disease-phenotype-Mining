Activated Protein C resistance is a recently described clotting disorder, accounting for several previously undiagnosed thrombophilic states. Initially this defect had been associated with leg vein thromboses, but it is now recognised that other vascular beds are also prone to clotting in this disorder. We report a case of acute proptosis in a patient with Activated Protein C resistance, due to cavernous sinus thrombosis.
