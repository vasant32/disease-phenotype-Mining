The clinical features of 101 Melanesian patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia observed during two 2-year periods (1977-1979 and 1985-1987) in a university teaching hospital in Papua New Guinea are reviewed. The age of the patients ranged from 12 to 70 years. There were 69 males and 32 females. Diabetes mellitus, found in 15 patients, was the most common predisposing factor. Most of the patients (87%) had community-acquired infection. Soft-tissue infection, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, intravenous-site thrombophlebitis, cerebral abscess, endocarditis and cavernous sinus thrombosis were among the clinical entities observed. Soft tissues and lungs were the most common sites of primary and secondary foci of infection, respectively. All but 1 of the 101 blood isolates were resistant to penicillin G and none was resistant to methicillin. The overall case fatality rate was 24%. These data demonstrate that staphylococcal bacteraemia in adult Papua New Guineans is mostly community acquired and has a high mortality. Skin and soft tissues are the major primary foci of infection leading to staphylococcal bacteraemia.
