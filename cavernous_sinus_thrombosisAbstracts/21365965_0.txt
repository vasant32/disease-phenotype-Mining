 OBJECTIVES: We describe a case of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) skin infection leading to bilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) and subsequent left eye blindness in a previously healthy, immunocompetent woman. A secondary objective is to document all published cases of MRSA induced CST. DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: To identify all relevant publications on MRSA-induced CST in adults. RESULTS: Seven publications were included in this review describing patients age 19 or older. Together, with the case included in this publication, a total of 8 cases of MRSA induced CST have been documented since 2003. Of interest, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of CA-MRSA CST temporally associated with nasal H1N1 vaccination. CONCLUSION: In selecting empiric antibiotic coverage for septic CST, the practitioner should use antibiotics that are active against CA-MRSA to help prevent morbidity and mortality.
