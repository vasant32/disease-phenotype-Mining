A case of rhinocerebral mucormycosis evaluated by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is presented, with inflammatory changes in the paranasal sinuses and orbit. Extension of the infection into the cavernous sinus, with cavernous sinus thrombosis and internal carotid artery narrowing, was well demonstrated on pre- and postgadolinium MR images. Infarctions in the anterior choroidal artery distribution suggested intracranial invasion of basal arteries, and watershed distribution infarctions attested to the tenuousness of flow through a narrowed cavernous carotid artery. Magnetic resonance effectively demonstrated the wide array of findings possible in rhinoorbitocerebral mucormycosis.
