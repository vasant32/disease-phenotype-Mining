Visual loss is uncommon in thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. A patient observed closely in the acute stages developed high introcular and intraorbital pressures.

To our knowledge this is the first documented case in which ischemic optic neuropathy caused blindness in a patient suffering from cavernous sinus thrombosis.
