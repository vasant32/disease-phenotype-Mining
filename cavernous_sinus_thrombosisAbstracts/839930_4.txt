Three cases of mucormycosis are presented; two with unusual aspects: one with previously unreported involvement of the mandible, and one presenting as a cavernous sinus thrombosis. Review of the literature reveals a limited number of survivors. Survival in two of the cases presented here suggests that early diagnosis, aggressive therapy with surgery, and amphotericin B should improve the prognosis.
