Thrombosis of cavernous sinus is one of the most grave diseases of cerebral venous system; its first signs most often manifest in the organ of vision. Pain in the orbit and the respective half of the head develop in the presence of general fatigue, chill, and fever. In parallel with this, venous dyscirculatory disorders in the eye and its appendages involve all oculomotor nerves in succession. Further progress of the disease leads to development of congestive optic disk. Involvement of the other eye is one of the most severe complications of cavernous sinus thrombosis. Further course and manifestations depend on 3 factors: premorbid status, location of the focus of infection, and routes of its penetration into cavernous sinus.
