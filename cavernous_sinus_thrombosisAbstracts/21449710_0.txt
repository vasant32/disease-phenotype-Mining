We report a case of community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) preseptal cellulitis complicated by zygomatic osteomyelitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and necroziting pneumonia in a previously healthy two and half month old girl. This case exemplifies an aggressive and disseminated CA-MRSA infection with deep venous thrombosis in an infant without predisposing risk factors. The literature is reviewed and recommendations for management are provided.
