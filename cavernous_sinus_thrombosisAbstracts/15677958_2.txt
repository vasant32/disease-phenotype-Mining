A 47-year-old diabetic man with chronic renal failure presented with a 1-month history of complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, left proptosis, and left-sided headache. During the course of the patient's care, other significant diagnoses were excluded, such as orbital inflammatory syndrome, carotid-cavernous syndrome, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. Neuroimaging revealed only minimal left sphenoid sinus disease. Sphenoid biopsy revealed the presence of septate hyphae on Gram staining and produced a fungal culture characteristic of Schizophyllum commune. Minimal sphenoid sinus infection in a patient with chronic medical issues and probable immunosuppression predisposed this patient to fungal rhino-orbital infection. Several weeks of intravenous liposomal amphotericin treatment on an outpatient basis yielded resolution of clinical symptoms.
