A 76-year-old woman presented with an enlarged right intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm first identified incidentally when she was hospitalized for thalamic hemorrhage. She was managed conservatively for 1 year, then suffered right total ophthalmoplegia associated with enlargement of the aneurysm. Two months later, she became comatose due to intracerebral hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated further enlargement of the aneurysm. Emergency craniotomy found the lateral dural wall of the cavernous sinus was markedly expanded and torn by compression from the aneurysm. Rupture of the aneurysm into the intradural space through this dural defect was confirmed. The aneurysm was trapped after high-flow bypass, but the patient did not recover and died. Symptomatic enlarged intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm is potentially fatal and may indicate prompt surgical management.
