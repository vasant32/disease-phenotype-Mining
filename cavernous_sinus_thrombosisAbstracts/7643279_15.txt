Complications and local extension of paranasal sinus infections most often involve the orbit and periorbita. Because of the widespread use of antibiotics since World War II, intracranial extension of maxillofacial sinusitis is rarely seen today. Nevertheless, the clinician must be aware of the potential for these complications, because late recognition of this condition and delays in treatment can increase morbidity and mortality rates. A comprehensive, current review of sinogenic intracranial complications is presented, with illustrative cases of brain abscess, subdural empyema, meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, epidural abscess, and osteomyelitis. The mechanisms and potential for intracranial spread of infection from the frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses are discussed in detail. The management of each type of complication is outlined, including the use of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the role of surgical drainage.
