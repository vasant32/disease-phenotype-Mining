We present what we believe to be the only documented cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis complicated by acute hypopituitarism and ultimately resulting in limited pituitary ACTH reserve. If pituitary involvement is suspected, replacement therapy should be instituted while awaiting laboratory confirmation. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a medical and surgical emergency. Its successful therapy is dependent upon prompt recognition, surgical drainage when appropriate, proper antibiotic coverage, and close observation for and prompt treatment of complications and sequelae.
