Orbital cellulitis is uncommon. It may arise as a sequel to eyelid infection, or from direct spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses; it may be of odontogenic origin and has been reported after meningitis and after nasoorbital fractures with pre-existing sinusitis. Clinically, orbital cellulitis is of great importance, as it is a severe disease with potentially disastrous consequences. It may lead to optic neuritis, optic atrophy, blindness, cavernous sinus thrombosis, superior orbital fissure syndrome, meningitis, subdural empyema, and even death. We report two cases of severe post-traumatic orbital cellulitis with subperiosteal abscesses. These were managed surgically and vision was preserved. We describe the anatomy, a classification of orbital infection, and the importance of multidisciplinary management of these cases.
