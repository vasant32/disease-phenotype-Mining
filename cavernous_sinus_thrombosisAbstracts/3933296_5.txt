The use of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) is described in four patients with septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. In all patients CT findings included multiple irregular filling defects in the enhancing cavernous sinus. Unilateral or bilateral inflammatory changes in the orbital soft tissues were also present. Enlargement of the superior ophthalmic vein due to extension of thrombophlebitis was noted in three patients.
