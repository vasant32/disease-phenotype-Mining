 OBJECTIVE: A 63-year-old woman presented with diplopia resulting from abducens paralysis. Examination revealed a giant cavernous aneurysm supplied by the internal carotid artery (ICA) and primitive trigeminal artery (PTA) via the vertebrobasilar system. METHODS: After evaluation of balloon test occlusion (BTO) at the distal side of the PTA origin, the aneurysm was treated with PTA obliteration through the suboccipital route in the lateral position followed by cervical carotid ligation with superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis in the supine position. RESULTS: The aneurysm showed marked shrinkage after the surgery. CONCLUSION: PTA obliteration through the retrosigmoid opening is a therapeutic surgical option in a patient with a cavernous aneurysm supplied by the PTA.
