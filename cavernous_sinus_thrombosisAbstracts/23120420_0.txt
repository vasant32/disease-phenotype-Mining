In a typical presentation of cavernous sinus thrombosis there are palsies of IIIrd, IVth and VIth cranial nerves along with disturbance of ophthalmic division (V1) of trigeminal nerve. In this manuscript we report a case of unilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis for its atypical presentation. Atypical features in this case were presence of ipsilateral lower motor neuron type facial nerve palsy and involvement of maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) branches of trigeminal nerve along with other nerve palsies. The VIIth nerve palsy in cavernous sinus thrombosis has not been reported in the literature.
