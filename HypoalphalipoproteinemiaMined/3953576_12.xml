<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age- and sex-adjusted, standardized <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c levels on 64 individuals in 14 nuclear families in which the proband was a parent were analyzed using the unified mixed model of segregation analysis as implemented in the computer program POINTER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The analysis proceeded by using the likelihood of offspring conditional on the parental phenotypes (conditional likelihood), which appears to overcome the limitation of possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the selection criteria and provides an appropriate correction for the ascertainment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these families, the multifactorial contribution to the phenotype appears to be small and significant only in the offspring generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it was not possible to resolve the dominance pattern at the major locus since none of a recessive, additive, or dominant hypothesis could be firmly rejected, these families provided clear evidence for a major gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> is still a possibility, even within "primary" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
