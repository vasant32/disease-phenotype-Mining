<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mild changes in ABCA1 activity due to genomic variation might be associated with interindividual variations in serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and apoAI levels, or primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the relationships between 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2 insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region and 5 missense polymorphisms of the ABCA1 gene and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in healthy school-aged children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We detected significant associations between the K219R and V771M polymorphisms, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> or apoAI levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present data support the proposition that the K219 allele is an anti-atherogenic allele with <z:mp ids='MP_0003192'>increased cholesterol efflux</z:mp> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the M771 allele appears to be anti-atherogenic, although the frequency of the M771 allele is low </plain></SENT>
