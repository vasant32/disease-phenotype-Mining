<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and/or fibrinogen plasma concentrations, related gene polymorphisms and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> are also risk factors for SHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> plasma concentrations, fibrinogen levels, and two functionally relevant fibrinogen polymorphisms were determined in 142 consecutive patients and in 84 age- and sex-matched control subjects of the same ethnic background, using routine laboratory methods and PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we determined the platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> Ia (GPIa) C807T polymorphism, which was recently proposed to be a genetic risk factor for SHL, and we compared the patients' and controls' clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations were not different between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen plasma levels were significantly increased in SHL patients (260+/-57 vs. 239+/-110 mg/dl, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, fibrinogen was not related to SHL in multivariate analysis, and none of the investigated fibrinogen polymorphisms was associated with SHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, T allele carriers of the GPIa 807 polymorphic site had an increased risk to develop SHL (OR 1.81) and were more likely not to recover from SHL, compared to C allele carriers (OR 3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significantly more SHL patients were current smokers (56.3% vs. 19.3% in the control group, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, there is a partial overlap between classical coronary risk factors and risk factors for SHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>Hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels) are apparently no major risk factors for SHL, whereas the GPIa C807T polymorphism, elevated fibrinogen levels, and smoking are associated with an increased risk for SHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Altogether these findings suggest a vascular involvement in the pathogenesis of SHL and may have important implications for the development of therapeutic and preventive strategies </plain></SENT>
