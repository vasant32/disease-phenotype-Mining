<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most prominent example is ABCA1, mutations in which affect plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABCC6 is another member of the ABC gene family, and mutations in ABCC6 were recently shown to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033847" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PXE">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PXE</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A Canadian patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PXE</z:e> was referred for assessment of moderately severe type IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0010980'>hyperlipoproteinemia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, which was refractory to pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified intron-exon boundaries of ABCC6 to sequence genomic DNA from this patient to find the disease mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report (1) identification of a set of amplification primers for the 31 exons of ABCC6; (2) identification of the ABCC6 R&gt;X1164 nonsense mutation in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PXE</z:e> subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>; (3) identification of common amino acid variants and silent nucleotide variants in ABCC6, with a range of allele frequencies across ethnic groups; (4) evidence consistent with a possible pseudogene encoding 9 exons with sequence homology to ABCC6; and (5) association of the ABCC6 R&gt;Q1268 variant with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that ABCC6 may be a determinant of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
