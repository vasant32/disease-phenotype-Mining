<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> from blood spots on filter paper were eluted with detergents (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The eluates were subjected to electrophoresis on <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel containing antisera against both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within- and between-assay CVs for apo B/A-I ratios were less than 5.5% and 7.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apo B/A-I ratio was influenced by length and temperature of storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In results for 121 venous blood samples, the apo B/A-I ratios in dried blood spots correlated well with those in serum (r = 0.92) and correlated somewhat with the ratios for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> in serum (r = 0.87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these specimens, 68 were from patients with known familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had an apo B/A-I ratio greater than 0.90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We think this method will be of value for detecting familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and possibly familial hyperapobeta- and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
