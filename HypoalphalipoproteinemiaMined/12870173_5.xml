<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, information regarding the frequency of common variants, including Arg219Lys (R219K) within the coding region of the ABCA1 gene and their effect on these phenotypes in the general population is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the frequency and phenotypic effect of R219K variant in a community-based sample of 887 white and 390 black young adults aged 20 to 38 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the variant allele (K219) was higher in blacks than in whites (0.595 v 0.262, P&lt;.001), with carriers (KK+RK) representing 83.8% of blacks versus 44.2% of whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), and sex, the genotype effect on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and natural logarithm of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> was not apparent in whites or blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, significant interaction effects of genotype and age on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P&lt;.001) and genotype and BMI on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (P=.029) were found in whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carriers (KK+RK), unlike noncarriers (RR) showed a positive relationship between age and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (regression coefficient beta=0.28, P=.029 for carriers v beta=-0.18, P=.112 for noncarriers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the variant allele attenuated the adverse positive relationship between BMI and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (beta=0.032, P&lt;.001 for carriers v beta=0.046, P&lt;.001 for noncarriers) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the K219 allele frequency differs markedly between blacks and whites, and that the variant-allele modulates the association between age and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, as well as body fatness and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in a beneficial manner only in whites </plain></SENT>
