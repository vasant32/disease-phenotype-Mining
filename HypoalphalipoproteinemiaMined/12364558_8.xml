<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[(3)H]<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> of 11.1 transgenic mice presented greater binding but decreased uptake compared with control mice when Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with SR-BI were used, thereby pointing to unknown but SR-BI-independent mechanisms as being responsible for the increased (3)H-radioactivity seen in liver and gonads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synthesis rate (SR) of plasma [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was 2-fold decreased in 11.1 transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mouse (125)I-apoA-I was 2-fold more rapidly catabolized (mainly by the kidney) in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mouse apoA-I displacement from <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> by the addition of isolated human apoA-II was reproduced ex vivo; thus, this mechanism may be involved in the increased renal catabolism of apoA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I SR was 2-fold decreased in 11.1 transgenic mice and this was concomitant with a 2.3-fold decrease in hepatic apoA-I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that multiple mechanisms are involved in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency presented by mice overexpressing human apoA-II </plain></SENT>
