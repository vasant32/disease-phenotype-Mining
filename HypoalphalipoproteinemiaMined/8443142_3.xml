<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, information is limited regarding the postprandial response to a fat load in subjects with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting TG values (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> [hypoalpha]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We administered an oral fat load (70 g/m2 of body surface area) to six subjects with hypoalpha and six aged-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mass and chemical composition of Sf &gt; 100 or Sf 20-100 TRLs were not different between the fasting groups; postprandial Sf &gt; 100 but not Sf 20-100 TRLs (mean +/- SD) was significantly lower in subjects with hypoalpha (200.4 +/- 64.8 mg/dL versus 110.6 +/- 50.9 mg/dL; analysis of variance, F test, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the hypoalpha subjects, the compositions of postprandial Sf &gt; 100 TRLs were TG poor and cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> enriched (p &lt; 0.001) while the Sf 20-100 TRLs were enriched in cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> but relatively protein depleted (p = 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
