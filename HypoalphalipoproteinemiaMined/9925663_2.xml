<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced LCAT activity was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypo-alpha-lipoproteinemia</z:e> (group I) whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LCAT activity was associated with hyper-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241784" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alpha-lipoproteinemia</z:e> (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both groups, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) were enriched with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and LpA-I particles were predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated the ability of serum and of isolated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, obtained from PILBD and control subjects, to promote cellular cholesterol efflux, from Fu5AH rat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean fractional efflux to 5% serum in each group was, on average, following the differences in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> concentrations (control: 30.1 +/- 4.2%; group I: 23.7 +/- 7.9%, ns; group II: 44.2 +/- 6.5%, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variations in efflux values in group II were positively correlated to the variations in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-PL concentrations (P &lt; 0.0001) and in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-PL to serum apo-AI ratio (P &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the variation in efflux in group I was only positively related to the large range of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-PL to free cholesterol (FC) ratio values (P &lt; 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fractional efflux to isolated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, measured at a constant <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-PL amount, confirmed this relationship (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> size and apo A-I distribution in serum, revealed that small size <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(3) and pre-beta <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were predominant in the serum of patients from group I, especially those exhibiting low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-PL to FC ratio, whereas in the serum of patients from group II, both small <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>(3) and large HDL2 were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a combination of an imbalance between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and free cholesterol in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles and a deficit in large acceptors of cholesterol will be responsible for an impairment of cellular cholesterol efflux in PILBD patients with reduced lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity.-Davit-Spraul, A., V </plain></SENT>
