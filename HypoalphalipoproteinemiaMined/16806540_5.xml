<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) is a trans-membrane protein responsible for the efflux of cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> across the cell membrane, an essential step in the reverse cholesterol transport system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the effect of five non-synonymous SNPs of ABCA1 gene on plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in Pakistani individuals free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five non-synonymous SNPs were selected after sequencing ABCA1 gene in patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of these SNPs was then checked in 200 individuals by using PCR-RFLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fractions were measured in fasting state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee, Aga Khan University and informed consent was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LL genotype of V825L polymorphism was associated with decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> [-0.17 (-0.32 to -0.19); P=0.02] and P774 allele showed a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels as compared to T774 allele [-0.15 (-0.18 to -0.02); P=0.01] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>R219K, A399V and V771M polymorphisms did not show any association with levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis between R219K and V825L polymorphisms showed a unique interaction between R219 allele and L825 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The RL haplotype was found to be associated with decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> [-0.12 (-0.22 to -0.03); P=0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ABCA1 polymorphisms are associated with varying levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> in Pakistani individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results warrant further investigations as ABCA1 polymorphisms may have a major role in the high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disorders</z:e> in South Asians </plain></SENT>
