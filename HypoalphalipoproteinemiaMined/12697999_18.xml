<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ABCA subfamily of ABC transporters includes ten members to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe an additional gene, ABCA12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four full-length cDNA sequences have been obtained from human placenta that contain two different polyadenylation sites and two splicing forms, coding for ABCA12 isoforms of 2,595 and 2,516 amino acid residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both isoforms are predicted to have two ATP-binding domains (nucleotide binding domain, NBD) and two transmembrane (TM) domains, features shared by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other ABCA subfamily proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ABCA12 is most closely related to ABCA1, with an amino acid similarity of 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis demonstrates that a 9.5-kb transcript is mainly expressed in the stom- <z:chebi fb="93" ids="22614">ach</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABCA12 was mapped to human chromosome 2q34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two other genes from ABCA subfamily are associated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e>, ABCA1 with the cholesterol transport disorders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, and ABCA4 with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ABCA12 gene is located in a region of chromosome 2q34 that harbors the genes for lamellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0008064'>ichthyosis</z:hpo>, polymorphic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000519'>congenital cataract</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (IDDM13), and therefore is a positional candidate for these pathologies </plain></SENT>
