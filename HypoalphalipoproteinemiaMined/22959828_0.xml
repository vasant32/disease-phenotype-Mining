<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients (aged 6 months to 76 years) presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> suggesting the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> (TD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of them were homozygous for novel mutations either in intron (c.4465-34A&gt;G) or in exons (c.4376delT and c.5449C&gt;T), predicted to encode truncated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient was compound heterozygous for a nucleotide insertion (c.1758_1759insG), resulting in a truncated protein and for a nucleotide substitution c.4799A&gt;G, resulting in a missense mutation (p.H1600R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last TD patient, found to be heterozygous for a known mutation (p.D1009Y), had a complete defect in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in fibroblasts, suggesting the presence of a second undetected mutant allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the other patients, four were asymptomatic, but one, with multiple risk factors, had severe peripheral artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients were heterozygous for known mutations (p.R130K+p.N1800H, p.R1068C, p.N1800H), while two were carriers of novel mutations (c.1195-27G&gt;A and c.396_397insA), predicted to encode truncated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenic effect of the two intronic mutations (c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1195-27G&gt;A and c.4465-34A&gt;G) was demonstrated by the analysis of the transcripts of splicing reporter mutant minigenes expressed in COS-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both mutations activated an intronic acceptor splice site which resulted in a partial intron retention in mature <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with the production of truncated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study confirms the allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of TD and suggests that the diagnosis of TD must be considered in patients with an unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003146'>hypocholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
