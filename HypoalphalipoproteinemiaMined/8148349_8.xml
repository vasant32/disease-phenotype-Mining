<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-seven middle-aged men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels (&lt; 40 mg/dL) were compared with 37 middle-aged men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels (&gt; 40 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients were divided into those with normotriglyceridemia (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &lt; 250 mg/dL; n = 49) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &gt; or = 250 mg/dL; n = 28) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients' apoA-I levels were numerically lower in LpA-I:A-II compared with control subjects' levels, the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This preferential reduction in LpA-I levels was observed in both normotriglyceridemic and hypertriglyceridemic patients </plain></SENT>
