<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 2000 National Health Survey is a cross sectional study that included individuals from 400 cities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals who had a 9-12-h fasted blood sample and a DNA sample were selected (n = 1729) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These cases were randomly distributed; no bias was detected for sex, education, region or socioeconomic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The R230C variant was genotyped using TaqMan assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In individuals with the R230C/C230C genotypes (39.03 mg/dl (36.63-41.43)) lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels (p &lt; 0.001) were observed compared to those with the R230R genotype (44.7 mg/dl (43.31-46.24)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference remained significant after adjusting for gender, body mass index and waist circumference; the mean difference in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels between alleles was 5.73 Â± 1.4 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the effect was significantly greater in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The C230 allele of ABCA1 was associated with an increased risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (OR 1.66 (95%CI 1.08-2.54), p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The population attributable risk (PAR) for having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> of the C230 allele of the ABCA1, after considering the confounding effect of waist circumference and gender, was 12.2% (95%CI 1.4-24.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The non-synonymous Arg230Cys variant of ABCA1 is associated with low levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in Mexican adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> lowering effect of the variant is greater in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The size of the effect is greater compared to that reported for other ABCA1 variants </plain></SENT>
