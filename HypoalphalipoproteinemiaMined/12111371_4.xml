<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that patients with apparently isolated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency who are found to carry ABCA1 mutations may in fact belong to a category of TD patients whose phenotypic features are only partially expressed, and that a number of hidden clinical variants of TD might exist among other <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency patients who have escaped correct clinical diagnosis </plain></SENT>
