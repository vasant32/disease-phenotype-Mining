<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In many cases, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> reduction in patients with CAD may be the result of increased apo B-containing <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> production by the liver with secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
