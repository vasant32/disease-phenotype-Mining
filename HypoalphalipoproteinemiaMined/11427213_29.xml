<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of avasimibe (CI-1011), a new, unique, wholly synthetic ACAT inhibitor, was evaluated in the treatment of 130 men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following an 8-week placebo and dietary-controlled baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with placebo, 50, 125, 250, or 500 mg avasimibe administered as capsules once daily for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluated doses, avasimibe treatment resulted in prompt and significant reductions (P&lt;0.05) in plasma levels of total <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL-C</z:chebi>) with mean reductions of up to 23% and 30% respectively, apparently independent of dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant changes in total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) B were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoAI levels were also unchanged on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> doses of avasimibe apart from the 500 mg dosage, which was associated with a significant decrease in plasma apoAI </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> doses of avasimibe were well tolerated with no resulting significant abnormalities of biochemical, hematological, or clinical parameters </plain></SENT>
