<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the Mexican Mestizo and Indian populations it is unknown the diagnostic criteria (DC) and associated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) for the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to establish, in a Mexican adult population without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, their <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c concentrations, the DC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> and prevalence base on the percentile-10 and the risk associated with MI, as well as the threshold (TH) associated with cardiovascular protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 826 adult Mestizos, 98 Indians and 155 Mestizos with MI for the first time the average <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c serum concentrations were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the percentile and statistical analysis were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c (mg/dl) concentrations for Mestizos and Indians were 43.2 and 37.2 and the ones inferior to the percentile-10 were &lt;30 and &lt;26, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Mestizos, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c concentrations of ≤ 35 mg/dl (odds ratio [OR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.3-2.8, P=.001) were associated with MI and those &gt;35 (OR 0.52, IC 95% 0.36-0.76, P=.001) were associated with a cardiovascular protection of 52% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> prevalences in Mestizos and Indians were: for the percentile-10 DC 9 and 11% and for the TH associated with MI ≤ 35, 26 and 54%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Indians average <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c concentration was significantly lower (P&lt;.003) than for Mestizos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The established DC showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> prevalences in both populations were similar to those for other open populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In Mestizos, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c concentrations &gt; 35 mg/dl are protective for MI, but it will be necessary to establish this TH for the Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Each population should establish its own DC for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
