<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> responses to conventional <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-modifying drugs have not been adequately evaluated in normolipidemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (low levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">gemfibrozil</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The first phase of the study compared <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">gemfibrozil</z:chebi> in 61 middle-aged men with low levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second phase, 37 patients agreed to take <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi>; 27 patients finished this phase at a dose of 4.5 g/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">Nicotinic acid</z:chebi> results were compared with those with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">gemfibrozil</z:chebi> in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the first phase, both drugs effectively lowered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">Gemfibrozil</z:chebi> therapy increased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels by 10% and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> by 6%, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> was much more effective for reducing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">Nicotinic acid</z:chebi> did not significantly lower <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels in the second phase, but it raised <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels by 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5296">Gemfibrozil</z:chebi> therapy produced the least favorable response of the three drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">Lovastatin</z:chebi> markedly lowered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels but only modestly raised levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, whereas <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> had the opposite effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the latter two drugs similarly reduced <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> ratios, although these effects were obtained in different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Between these two drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40303">lovastatin</z:chebi> therapy was more likely to reduce <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels to below 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and in view of recent recommendations, it may be preferable to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> for many normolipidemic patients with established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
