<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of these mutations and their relative effects on HDLc reduction and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) are less clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we searched for ABCA1, APOA1, and LCAT mutations in 178 unrelated probands with HDLc &lt;10th percentile but no other major <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities, including 89 with ≥1 first-degree relative with low HDLc (familial probands) and 89 where familial status of low HDLc is uncertain (unknown probands) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were most frequent in LCAT (15.7%), followed by ABCA1 (9.0%) and APOA1 (4.5%), and were found in 42.7% of familial but only 14.6% of unknown probands (p=2.44∗10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only 16 of 24 (66.7%) mutations assessed in families conferred an average HDLc &lt;10th percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, only mutation carriers with HDLc &lt;5th percentile had elevated risk of CAD (odds ratio (OR)=2.26 for 34 ABCA1 mutation carriers vs. 149 total first-degree relative controls, p=0.05; OR=2.50 for 26 APOA1 mutation carriers, p=0.04; OR=3.44 for 38 LCAT mutation carriers, p=1.1∗10(-3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations show that mutations in ABCA1, APOA1, and LCAT are sufficient to explain &gt;40% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, individuals with mutations and large reductions in HDLc have increased risk of CAD </plain></SENT>
