<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To develop an in vivo system to explore, in a controlled manner, the effects of apoA-I(M) on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism, we have used the gene targeting technology, or "gene knock-in" (gene k-in), to replace the murine apoA-I gene with either human apoA-I or apoA-I(M) genes in embryonic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As in human carriers, mice expressing apoA-I(M) (A-I(M) k-in) are characterized by low concentrations of the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> and reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, compared with A-I k-in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the basic mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> associated with the apoA-I(M) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I and apoA-I(M) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, as assessed by Northern blot analysis and quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR, did not exhibit significant differences in either liver or intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> synthesis rates were similar in the k-in lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the secretion rate of the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> was assessed in cultured hepatocytes from the mouse lines, secretion from apoA-I(M)-expressing cells was markedly reduced (42% for A-I(M) k-in and 36% for A-I/A-I(M) k-in mice) as compared with that of A-I k-in hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first evidence that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in apoA-I(M) human carriers may be partially explained by impaired apoA-I(M) secretion </plain></SENT>
