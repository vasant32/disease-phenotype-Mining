<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether high CETP activities are associated with isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, CETP activities were measured in 109 adult men with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt; 35 mg/dL, plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &lt; 200 mg/dL, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt; 160 mg/dL; the results were compared with those of 50 normolipidemic (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &gt; 40 mg/dL) male subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CETP activities were assayed in vitro and expressed as the percent of [3H]cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> transferred from HDL3 to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> during a 16-hour incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, postheparin plasma activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) and hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lipase (HTGL) were determined in 71 patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distributions of CETP activities were unimodal in control subjects (mean +/- SD, 23.1 +/- 5.0%), but they were bimodal in the low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the latter, 27 patients had elevated CETP activities (40.8 +/- 4.6%), whereas 82 patients had CETP activities that overlapped the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (26.14 +/- 7.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CETP activities had 20% lower LPL activities (P = .01), 25% higher HTGL activities (P = .03), and 63% lower LPL/HTGL ratios (P &lt; .001) than those of low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients with increased CETP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, mean LPL and HTGL activities in the low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients with elevated CETP activities were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another important distinction between the two subgroups with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was that the subgroup with high CETP activity had only a 30% prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> compared with a 70% prevalence in the subgroup with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CETP activity (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that elevated CETP activity may be a significant factor in causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels in a distinct subgroup of normolipidemic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
