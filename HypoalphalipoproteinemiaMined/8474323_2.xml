<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vitamin A was included in the meal to label intestinally derived <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-rich particles (TRP) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15040">retinyl palmitate</z:chebi> (RP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HP subjects were either mildly hypertriglyceridemic (group A) or normotriglyceridemic (group B) and were phenotyped for post-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) and hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lipase (HTGL) activities and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) E isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postprandial total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, and RP and TG concentrations in the chylomicron (Sf &gt; 1,000) and nonchylomicron (Sf &gt; 1,000) fractions were evaluated for 24 hours after the meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At each time point, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> composition and size and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> distributions were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following the SFA meal, HP subjects had maximal plasma TG levels at 8 hours (4 hours in controls) with a slow return to baseline levels at 12 to 24 hours (8 to 12 hours for controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after the omega-6 meal plasma TG levels decreased in group A subjects, while group B subjects and controls showed only a small increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results after the omega-6 meal were intermediate between the SFA and the omega-3 meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When compared with group B, subjects in group A showed higher levels of RP-associated TRP, slower clearance rates, 30% to 50% lower fasting LPL activity, and 1.5-fold to twofold higher fasting plasma apo C-III levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major preprandial <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subclass in HP subjects was HDL3, which showed a relative decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol esters</z:chebi> (CE) and an increase in TG levels following the SFA meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the omega-3 meal, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> of group A subjects showed a decrease in TG, a reciprocal increase in CE, and either no changes or minor changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> (PL) and free-cholesterol (FC) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results show that HP subjects with mild preprandial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> respond to a single fat meal differently than subjects with normotriglyceridemia, and that this difference is the result of HP in addition to other factors such as low LPL and HTGL activities, high plasma apo C-III levels, and apo E2 phenotype </plain></SENT>
