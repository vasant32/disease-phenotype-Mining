<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom proband ascertainment was based on single selection through truncation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> at an earlier screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A path model was used to investigate the nature of familial resemblance using appropriate adjustments for ascertainment and to determine whether random and hyperlipidemic samples are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with regard to the multifactorial model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that parameter estimates are consistent with those from previous studies in which only random families were used and that random and nonrandom samples are homogeneous with regard to the path model for CH and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, for TG and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> the random and hyperlipidemic samples are significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> would be observed if familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> segregates predominantly in the hyperlipidemic rather than in the random sample, as on might expect </plain></SENT>
