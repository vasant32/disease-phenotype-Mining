<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the prevalence of mutations at the ABCA1 gene in 58 unrelated probands of French-Canadian descent with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>&lt;5th percentile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A defective cellular cholesterol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux (&lt;75% and &lt;70% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, respectively) was identified in 14/58 (24%) of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using direct sequencing of the ABCA1 gene, we found mutations in 12/58 ( approximately 20%) of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four probands were previously identified with diverse ABCA1 gene defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, we identified a novel frameshift mutation (F1840L, L1869X); a proband was heteroallelic for the N1800H mutation, previously reported in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e>, and a novel missense mutation (Q2210H); a novel variant (G616V), predicted to impart a functional defect in the protein, was also found in another proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three probands had the S1731C mutation, while two others had the R1851X and K776N documented mutations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that approximately 20% of French-Canadian patients with severe <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency are associated with a defective ABCA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in two families studied, mutations in the ABCA1 gene did not segregate with the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> efflux defect, suggesting that other proteins are involved in the ABCA1-mediated cellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> efflux </plain></SENT>
