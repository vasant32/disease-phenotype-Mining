<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two uncontrolled studies suggested that plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35187">monoterpenes</z:chebi> may have substantial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>-elevating activity in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each study used a proprietary mixture of 6 monoterpenes in olive oil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to test more rigorously the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35187">monoterpenes</z:chebi> raise <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> concentrations in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four men aged 58-68 y (x: 62.3 y) with plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &lt;1.1 mmol/L, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> &lt;3.5 mmol/L, and plasma total cholesterol &lt;5.5 mmol/L at recruitment were randomly assigned to 6 capsules daily of a proprietary mixture of 6 monoterpenes in olive oil or 6 capsules daily of olive oil alone for 24 wk, followed by a washout period of 8 wk, and then the alternative capsules for 24 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five men dropped out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the others, compliance was excellent as judged by capsule counts and urinary menthol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant effects were observed on plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I concentrations, nor on plasma triacylglycerol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35187">monoterpenes</z:chebi> have no <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-elevating activity of potential value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
