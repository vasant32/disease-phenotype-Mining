<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this question, measurements of turnover rates of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (apo A-I) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (apo B) were made in 36 middle-aged men with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> (&lt; 40 mg/dL), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (&lt; 250 mg/dL), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total cholesterol (&lt; or = 90th percentile) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar measurements were made in eight hypertriglyceridemic men having low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For control, turnover rates of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> apo B were measured in 24 healthy, normolipidemic men, and apo A-I kinetics were determined in 20 other healthy men with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels, fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) for apo A-I were increased compared with control subjects; in contrast, input rates for apo A-I in low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients were similar to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypertriglyceridemic patients had significantly higher FCRs for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (0.463 +/- 0.040 pool/day, [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]) than control subjects (0.328 +/- 0.008 pool/day, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In normolipidemic patients having low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, a bimodal pattern of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-apo B kinetics was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For 23 low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients, FCRs for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> apo B averaged 0.450 +/- 0.017 pool/day and were significantly higher than control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in these patients, levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> plus intermediate density <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>+IDL) cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>+IDL apo B were higher than in control subjects (54 +/- 3 versus 32 +/- 3 mg/dL and 25 +/- 2 versus 18 +/- 1 mg/dL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining 13 low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> patients had lower and essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FCRs for <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (0.300 +/- 0.009 pool/day); these patients also had relatively low levels of cholesterol and apo B in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>+IDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, two patterns of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> kinetics were present in normotriglyceridemic patients with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One pattern was indistinguishable from that typically present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, whereas the other was similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These two patterns of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-apo B kinetics may reflect different mechanisms for the causation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> concentrations </plain></SENT>
