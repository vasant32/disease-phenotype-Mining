<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and macrovascular complications has increased in DM1 patients, regardless glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: To determine the prevalence of MS in patients with DM1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study of clinical characteristics of DM1 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biochemical and anthropometric parameters were determined and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and central <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MS was defined according to American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>/NHLBI) and National Cholesterol Education Program: Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP:ATPIII) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For this study 130 patients were evaluated (66% women) with a median age of 29.5 years (interquartile range [RI]: 22-36) and disease evolution of 12 years (RI: 7-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>47% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, 23% <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, 11% hypertrigliceridemia and 13% both pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally 64% had high level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (C-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) and 21% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>/NHLBI criteria, 37.5% (with three parameters) and 14% (more than three parameters) of patients were estimated to have MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, using NCEP:ATPIII criteria 25% (three parameters) and 11.5% (more than three parameters) had MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with DM1 and MS were older, heavier and had greater body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presence of MS in patients with DM1 is evident in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There are no differences in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> or insulin doses between groups with and without MS </plain></SENT>
