<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To shed more light on the apo B-100-apo(a) complex associated with plasma TRP during postprandial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lipidemia</z:e>, we fed five male subjects presenting with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (HP) and four male controls a single fat meal (60 g/m2) containing <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> (SFA) and, 6 weeks later, an isocaloric meal containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were phenotyped for plasma Lp(a) and apo C-III levels, apo(a) and apo E isoforms, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase and hepatic lipase activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vitamin A was included in the meal as a marker of intestinally derived TRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the SFA meal, three of the HP subjects showed a decrease in plasma levels of Lp(a) that lasted 10 to 12 hours in the presence of an increased hypertriglyceridemic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two HP subjects who had low preprandial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase activity and elevated plasma apo C-III levels showed an increase in plasma Lp(a) levels along with the hypertriglyceridemic excursion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, inclusive of the controls, there was an elevation in plasma levels of TRP of Sf greater than 1,000 that contained apo B-100-apo(a) 6 to 8 hours after the meal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This TRP excursion appeared not to be related to the basal levels of plasma Lp(a), <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, TGs, or apo(a) and apo E isoforms, and it did not coincide with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16179">retinyl ester</z:chebi> peak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
