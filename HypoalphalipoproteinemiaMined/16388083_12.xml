<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The impact of PLTP on reverse cholesterol transport suggests that the gene may harbor sequence anomalies that contribute to disorders of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human PLTP gene was screened for sequence anomalies by DNA melting analysis in 276 subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (HA) and 364 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association with plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discovered 18 sequence variations, including four missense mutations and a novel polymorphism (c.-34G &gt; C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In healthy controls, the c.-34G &gt; C minor allele was associated with higher <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and was depleted in subjects with HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression models predict that possession of the rare allele decreases plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG) and TG/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> independent of TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased PLTP activity was observed in one (p.R235W) of four (p.E72G, p.S119A, p.S124Y, and p.R235W) mutations in an in vitro activity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PLTP gene variation is an important determinant of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and affects disorders of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
