<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a need to assess whether human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus (HIV)-infected patients are more likely than noninfected individuals to have any of the specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> combination profiles identified as the best predictors of future <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred five infected patients, randomly selected from a Mexican HIV clinic, and 105 age- and gender-matched noninfected community volunteers, were enrolled to study the prevalence of each of three highly atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> phenotypes [high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (Apo)B/ApoA-I ratio, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> with high ApoB and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> with high ApoB], and the relationship between time of exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug class and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The highly atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> phenotypes were similarly frequent in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a nonsignificant increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> with longer exposure to any of the ART drug classes, although this hazard seems to be greater in patients with central fat accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of increased risk for certain highly atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> phenotypes in HIV-infected patients was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More than one pathogenic mechanism for ART-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> is postulated </plain></SENT>
