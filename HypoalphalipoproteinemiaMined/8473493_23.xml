<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects with apo A-IMilano are characterized by having low levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and apo A-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the kinetic etiology of the decreased plasma levels of the apo A-I in these individuals, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant apo A-I were isolated, radiolabeled with either 125I or 131I, and both types of apo A-I were simultaneously injected into two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and two subjects heterozygous for apo A-IMilano </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, apo A-IMilano was catabolized more rapidly than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apo A-I (mean residence times of 5.11 d for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apo A-I vs. 3.91 d for apo A-IMilano), clearly establishing that apo A-IMilano is kinetically abnormal and that it has a shortened residence time in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the two apo A-IMilano subjects, both types of apo A-I were catabolized more rapidly than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (residence times ranging from 2.63 to 3.70 d) with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> total apo A-I production rates (mean of 10.3 vs. 10.4 mg/kg per d in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the subjects with apo A-IMilano, the decreased apo A-I levels are caused by rapid catabolism of apo A-I and not to a decreased production rate, and the abnormal apo A-IMilano leads to the rapid catabolism of both the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant forms of apo A-I in the affected subjects </plain></SENT>
