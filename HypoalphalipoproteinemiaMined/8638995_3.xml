<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> effectively raise <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in this condition, but they are commonly accompanied by side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of low doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> that may produce fewer side effects has not been adequately studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of low-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four men with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels (&lt; 1.03 mmol/L [&lt; 40 mg/dL]) entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients otherwise had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels, and 20 were moderately hypertriglyceridemic (range of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, 2.82 to 5.64 mmol/L 250 to 500 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trial consisted of 3 phases; each phase lasted 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first phase was diet only (30% fat diet); in the second phase, crystalline <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> was added at 1.5 g/d; and in the third phase, the dose was increased to 3 g/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 44 patients who entered the study, 37 completed the low-dose phase (1.5 g/d); the remaining patients were withdrawn because of side effects to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four other patients who completed the low-dose phase were excluded from the higher dose phase because of side effects that developed when they were receiving the low dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten other patients withdrew during the high-dose phase because of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In both groups, responses to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> therapy tended to be dose-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For both groups, the higher dose generally produced a greater reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B-containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and a greater rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, for both groups, the low dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> gave an average 20% increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A low dose (1.5 g/d) of crystalline <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">nicotinic acid</z:chebi> causes an average 20% increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels and significantly lowers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in both normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic patients with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the changes induced by this dose are less than those that can be achieved by a higher dose, the lower dose is better tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="15940">Nicotinic acid</z:chebi> may be useful in combined drug therapy for secondary prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, and if higher doses cannot be tolerated, use of a lower dose should still be useful for producing a moderate rise in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
