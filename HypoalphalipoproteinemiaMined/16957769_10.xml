<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of a first-generation vector (FGAd-AI) resulted in a transient appearance of APOA1 in plasma and induced an anti-APOA1 antibody titer, whereas treatment with a helper-dependent vector (HDAd-AI) resulted in sustained APOA1 expression without inducing an antibody titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With these results, we studied the effects of FGAd vectors on APOAI expression by HDAd-AI vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Co-treatment with an FGAd vector inhibited HDAd-AI- mediated APOA1 expression independent of transgene cassettes, but only FGAd-AI induced a humoral response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, APOA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels in mice co-treated with FGAd vectors were much lower than those expected from the vector copy number, suggesting that DNA of FGAd vectors interferes with the HDAd-AI vector's APOA1 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A single treatment with an HDAd-AI vector produced a supraphysiological plasma APOA1 level that gradually declined to about half the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human level over the course of 2 years, associated with a plasma cholesterol level that is persistently higher than that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This investigation provides the proof of principle that liver-directed HDAd gene delivery is effective for the long-term phenotypic correction of monogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
