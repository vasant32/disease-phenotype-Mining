<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> exhibit extremely low plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> concentrations resulting from mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 1 (ABCA1) protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 controls the rate-limiting step in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particle assembly by mediating efflux of cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> from cells to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-free apoA-I, which forms nascent <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 is widely expressed; however, the specific tissues involved in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> biogenesis are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of the liver in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> biogenesis, we generated mice with targeted deletion of the second nucleotide-binding domain of Abca1 in liver only (Abca1(-L/-L)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abca1(-L/-L) mice had total plasma and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations that were 19% and 17% those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo catabolism of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> apoA-I from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice or human <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-free apoA-I was 2-fold higher in Abca1(-L/-L) mice compared with controls due to a 2-fold increase in the catabolism of apoA-I by the kidney, with no change in liver catabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in chow-fed mice, the liver is the single most important source of plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hepatic, but not extrahepatic, Abca1 is critical in maintaining the circulation of mature <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles by direct lipidation of hepatic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-poor apoA-I, slowing its catabolism by the kidney and prolonging its plasma residence time </plain></SENT>
