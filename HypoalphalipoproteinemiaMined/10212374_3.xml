<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is difficult to draw definite conclusions about the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> because of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of study designs described in published studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and the degree of target-organ damage, and to analyze the differences between true resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (TRH) and white-coat resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (WCRH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who visited the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> Clinic with resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were sequentially included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was defined as an average of three measurements of systolic blood pressure, &gt;/= 160 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure &gt;/= 95 mmHg, or both, in patients treated with a triple-drug regimen, over at least 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and M-mode bi-dimensional echocardiography were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WCRH was defined as a mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure &lt;/= 135/85 mmHg; patients with higher values were classified as having TRH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1200 hypertensive subjects who visited the clinic, 60 patients with resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were included [mean age 59+/-8 years; 38 women (63%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Office blood pressure was 173+/-14/100+/- 8 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 36 patients with a good quality echocardiograph, 18 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty cardiovascular events were recorded in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo> was present in 43% of patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 28%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in 47% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> was detected in 18%of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had TRH (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nineteen subjects (32%) had WCRH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The subjects with TRH had a higher office systolic blood pressure, greater frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> than those who had WCRH and a greater proportion of clinical target-organ damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is uncommon in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A third of patients with resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> achieve adequate control of their blood pressure outside the physician's office </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with clinical target-organ damage is greater in subjects with TRH than in those with WCRH </plain></SENT>
