<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We and others have recently identified mutations in the ABCA1 gene as the underlying cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> (TD) and of a dominantly inherited form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e>) associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003193'>reduced cholesterol efflux</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now identified 13 ABCA1 mutations in 11 families (five TD, six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e>) and have examined the phenotypes of 77 individuals heterozygous for mutations in the ABCA1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 heterozygotes have <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>decreased HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>increased triglycerides</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age is an important modifier of the phenotype in heterozygotes, with a higher proportion of heterozygotes aged 30-70 years having <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> greater than the fifth percentile for age and sex compared with carriers less than 30 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of cholesterol efflux are highly correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels, accounting for 82% of its variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each 8% change in ABCA1-mediated efflux is predicted to be associated with a 0.1 mmol/l change in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 heterozygotes display a greater than threefold increase in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), with earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> than unaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CAD is more frequent in those heterozygotes with lower cholesterol efflux values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data provide direct evidence that impairment of cholesterol efflux and consequently reverse cholesterol transport is associated with reduced plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels and increased risk of CAD </plain></SENT>
