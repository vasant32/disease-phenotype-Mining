<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in the general population due to mutation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (apo A-I) gene, we analyzed sequence variations in the apo A-I gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 67 children with a low <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol level (&lt;/=38 mg/dl, below the fifth percentile in the population of this study) who were screened from 1254 schoolchildren through a school survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four different mutations with deleterious potential, three frameshifts and one splice site mutation, were identified in four of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma apo A-I levels of the four children with apo A-I gene mutations were reduced to approximately half of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels and were below the first percentile of the general population distribution (80 mg/dl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> due to a mutant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I gene was estimated at 6% (95% CI: 2.4-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4%) in the subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1-0.8%) in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> due to apo A-I gene mutations is relatively common </plain></SENT>
