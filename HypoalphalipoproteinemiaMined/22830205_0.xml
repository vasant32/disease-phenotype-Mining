<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Before and 24 weeks after TLZ treatment 43 RA patients (33 women and 10 men) were examined by DAS 28 index, for blood serum concentration of cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG), LPHD and LPLD cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug was injected intravenously in drops in a dose 8 mg/kg each 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 24 week TLZ treatment produced satisfactory and good anti-inflammatory effects in RA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> incidence and atherogenicity index (AI) reduced 3 and 5 times, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of cholesterol, TG, LDPL cholesterol occurred with the same frequency before and after TLZ treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol rose by 11.6%, LPHD cholesterol--by 48.9%, TG lowered by 7%, Al--by 31.9% (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LDLP cholesterol decreased Blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> composition shifts were associated with marked reduction in the disease activity: decreased concentration of C-reactive protein, IgM rheumatoid factor, DAS28 index, improvement of the patient functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal thickness of the intima-media complex of CA increased by 8.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic plaques were revealed before and after treatment in 17 (41.4%) patients from 41, in 5 (12.2%) patients the plaques arose after 6 months and in 5 (12.2%) patients the number of plaques increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Because of both positive and negative effects of IL-6 receptor inhibitors on blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, combined treatment of RA must include <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> for correction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
