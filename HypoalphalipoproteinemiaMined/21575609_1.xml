<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in ABCA1 are a major genetic contributor to low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels within the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following the finding of three different ABCA1 mutations, p.C978fsX988, p.T1512M and p.N1800H in a subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, we aimed to establish whether the p.C978fsX988 truncation exerted a dominant negative effect on the full-length ABCA1 alleles within family members as has been reported for other ABCA1 truncations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Characterisation of the p.C978fsX988 mutant in transfected HEK 293 cells showed it to be expressed as a GFP fusion protein but lacking in cholesterol efflux function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was in keeping with results from cholesterol efflux assays in the fibroblasts of p.C978fsX988 carriers which also showed impaired efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele- specific quantification of p.C978fsX988 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and analysis of ABCA1 protein levels in the fibroblasts of p.C978fsX988 heterozygotes showed negligible levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of a dominant negative effect on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> or p.N1800H protein levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in the case of the p.C978fsX988 truncated mutant a lack of expression precludes it from having a dominant negative effect </plain></SENT>
