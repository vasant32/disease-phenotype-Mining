<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (HALP) is the most frequent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> alteration found in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> at an early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is defined by amounts of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> cholesterol at <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (cHDL) lower than 10% according to age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to know the frequency of main factors which reduce the levels of cHDL in a group of subjects with and without HALP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pathological antecedents, consumption of drugs, alcohol and cigarettes, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and levels of cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, cHDL, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> were studied in a group of 1825 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in the course of medical examinations for workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The consumption of cigarettes, the index of body mass (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e>) and the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were higher in the group of subjects with HALP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>Hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &gt; or = 200 mg/dl) was found in 31% of the subjects with HALP vs 10% in the control group (p &lt; 0.001); <z:hpo ids='HP_0003146'>hypocholesterolemia</z:hpo> (cholesterol &lt; or = 150 mg/dl) was also significantly greater (9.8% vs 4.3%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, in 64% of the subjects with HALP, factors which may decrease cHDL were associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the factors studied, the number of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IBM</z:e> and the number of cigarettes consumed per day were the independent factors which most significantly contributed to the decrease of cHDL in the regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most of the subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> present other modifiable factors such as an elevated index of body mass, cigarette consumption and high amounts of triglicerydes, the correction of which constitutes the base for treatment of this disorder </plain></SENT>
