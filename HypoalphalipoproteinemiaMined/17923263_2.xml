<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of this gene cause wide-ranging <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency, as evident in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to elucidate whether the presence of ABCA1 gene polymorphism could be a risk factor for overweight/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The presence of R219K and I883M genetic variant was determined by PCR-RFLP analysis in 112 overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 117 control subjects of both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed to find an association between polymorphism and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men carrying the mutant allele of R219K had lower level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> than the control (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no positive association was observed using bivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, there was no difference in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level among genotypes in I883M polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both polymorphisms appeared to be common in Thai ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was detected in genotype frequency between the two populations for both polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the lower level of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> in overweight/<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men carrying R219K in comparison to the control suggests the possible involvement of this gene with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, further investigations are needed to prove the influence of ABCA1 gene polymorphism on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level and to determine whether it could be a genetic determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
