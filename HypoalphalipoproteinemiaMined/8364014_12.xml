<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe a 46-year-old man with severe <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) deficiency and his kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the proband, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) A-I levels were 5 and 4.5 mg/dL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000991'>Xanthomata</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001114'>xanthelasma</z:hpo>, arcus corneae, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> were not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, but it was impossible to state whether the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency cosegregated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in this kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis was suggestive of a codominant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the apoA-I gene of the proband, followed by subcloning and sequencing, did not reveal any mutation in either the coding regions or intron-exon junctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A kinetic study using deuterated leucine to endogenously label apoA-I was performed to elucidate the metabolic basis of the apoA-I deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated marked hypercatabolism of apoA-I in the proband, with a fractional catabolic rate more than 10 times faster than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; the plasma residence time of apoA-I in the proband was only 0.38 day compared with 4.10 days in a control subject </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The apoA-I production rate was also substantially decreased in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The association of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I gene sequence with marked hypercatabolism of apoA-I is similar to that described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, except for the presence of mild, diffuse, <z:mp ids='MP_0005544'>corneal deposits</z:mp>, this patient had no evidence of the reticuloendothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_642'>cholesterol deposition</z:mpath> characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study establishes that a form of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> distinct from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> can be caused by marked hypercatabolism of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> A-I <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
