<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our specific aim was to assess within-family clustering of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>) levels in kindreds identified through probands with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, and to determine whether, and to what degree, familial aggregation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> less than or equal to the tenth percentile represents a heritable trait, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our probands were selected arbitrarily by virtue of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> less than or equal to the age-sex-race-specific tenth percentile as the sole dyslipoproteinemia, with an additional requirement that they be normotriglyceridemic (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels less than the 90th percentile) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probands were also required to have primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, not secondary to diseases and/or drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 16 probands were men; 12 were referred because of premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2 because of family history of premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 2 because of low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> observed on routine health examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the 16 kindreds exhibited three-generation vertical transmission of bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three kindreds, there was also three-generation vertical transmission of bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>, but top decile <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> accompanied bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> in one or more generations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight kindreds displayed two-generation vertical transmission of bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After excluding probands, there were 11 critical matings (bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>), with 30 living offspring, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were sampled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 30 offspring, 13 had bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>, 17 had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> greater than tenth percentile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of offspring with bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> to those of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> greater than tenth percentile was 13:17 (0.76/1), not significantly different from the ratio of 1/1, the ratio predictive of a dominant trait, X2(1) = 0.53, P greater than 0.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The nearly 1:1 segregation ratio for the group of offspring was not due to the aggregation of sibships with, in general, most of the sibs, or none of the sibs affected; within-family expression of low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> was also not sex-linked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 13 hypoalphalipoproteinemic offspring of 11 critical matings included only two subjects whose bottom decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> was accompanied by top decile <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that not only (by selection) was low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> in the probands the sole dyslipoproteinemia, but that the segregation of low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi> in offspring of critical matings was primarily accounted for by isolated low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDLC</z:chebi>, not by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
