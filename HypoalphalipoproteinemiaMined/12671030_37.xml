<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, variation at the APOAV locus was shown to modestly influence plasma TGs in normolipidemic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to assess the effects of a polymorphism in APOAV (T-1131C) in terms of its frequency among three dyslipidemic populations and a control population, differences of allele frequency across available ethnic groups, and associations with specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> TG and cholesterol compartments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found a striking elevation in the frequency of the rare allele in a Chinese population (P = 0.0002) compared with Hispanic and European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rare allele of the polymorphism was associated with elevated plasma TG (P = 0.012), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (P = 0.0007), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi> TG (P = 0.012), <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> TG (P = 0.003), and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> TG (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linear regression models predict that possession of the rare allele elevates plasma TG by 21 mg/dl (P = 0.009) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47773">VLDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by 8 mg/dl (P = 0.0001), and reduces <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by 2 mg/dl (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of the polymorphism with altered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profiles was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that APOAV is an important determinant of plasma TG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50404">lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and is potentially a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
