<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the molecular basis of this observation, the effect of activation of the aryl <z:chebi fb="59" ids="24632">hydrocarbon</z:chebi> receptor (AhR) on apo A-I gene expression was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: HepG2 cells were treated with AhR receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> (BaP) and CAY10465, and AhR receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CAY10464 and apo A-I protein, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and promoter activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> on apo A-I protein secretion was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a series or apo A-I gene promoter deletion constructs, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> response element (XRE) was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: Treatment of HepG2 cells with the AhR receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> BaP and CAY10465, inhibited apo A-I protein synthesis while <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>, which does not bind AhR had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">Benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> treatment also suppressed apo A-I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and gene promoter activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HepG2 cells with the AhR receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> CAY10464 reversed the suppressive effect of BaP on apo A-I gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A putative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> response element (XRE) was identified between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> -325 and -186 (relative to the transcriptional start site, +1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that the cigarette smoking related environmental contaminant BaP promotes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in part through activation of the hepatic AhR </plain></SENT>
