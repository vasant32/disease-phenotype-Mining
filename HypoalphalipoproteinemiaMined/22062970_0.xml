<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angptl3 knockout mice have marked hypolipidemia, and heterozygous carriers of ANGPLT3, loss-of-function mutations were found among individuals in the lowest quartile of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in population studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, 4 related individuals with primary hypolipidemia were found to be compound heterozygotes for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We resequenced ANGPTL3 in 4 members of 3 kindreds originally identified for very low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.97±0.16 and 0.56±0.20 mmol/L, respectively) in whom no mutations of known candidate genes for monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003563'>hypobetalipoproteinemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> had been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These subjects were found to be homozygous or compound heterozygous for ANGPTL3 loss-of-function mutations (p.G400VfsX5, p.I19LfsX22/p.N147X) associated with the absence of ANGPTL3 in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had reduced plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>-containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles that contained only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I and pre-β-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B-depleted sera had a reduced capacity to promote cell cholesterol efflux through the various pathways (ABCA1-, SR-BI-, and ABCG1-mediated efflux); however, these subjects had no clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous carriers of the ANGPTL3 mutations had low plasma ANGPTL3 and moderately reduced <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (2.52±0.38 mmol/L) but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Complete ANGPTL3 deficiency caused by loss-of-function mutations of ANGPTL3 is associated with a recessive hypolipidemia characterized by a reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I-containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, changes in subclasses of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003193'>reduced cholesterol efflux</z:mp> potential of serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated only with a moderate reduction of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
