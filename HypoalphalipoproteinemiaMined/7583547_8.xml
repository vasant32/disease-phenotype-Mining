<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated four large families in which individuals were found to be double heterozygotes for both FH and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These double heterozygotes have significantly less <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> than persons with FH or LPL heterozygosity alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the double heterozygotes, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particle composition is not significantly different from FH heterozygotes, suggesting a quantitative rather than qualitative defect in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism in these persons </plain></SENT>
