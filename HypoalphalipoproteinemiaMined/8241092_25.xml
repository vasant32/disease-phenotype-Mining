<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize the common familial forms of HA, we studied 102 families of probands with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo>; 40 probands (39.2%) had HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 25 had at least one first-degree relative affected with HA; 11 had familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> with HA (FTgHA); 10 had familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (FCH); and 4 had familial HA (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e>) with no other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 15 families, no <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities were observed in first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) A-I, B, C-III, and E levels as well as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> particle (Lp) levels of LpA-I (containing apoA-I only), LpA-I:A-II (containing both apoA-I and A-II), LpB:E, and LpB:C-III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with a reference group of healthy men (n = 103) and women (n = 106), probands with familial forms of HA had lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels by selection criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">Triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were higher in FTgHA and FCH probands than in the reference group or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite selection of FTgHA and FCH by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol, the latter was not significantly different between the three groups and the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I levels were decreased in FCH, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e>, and FTgHA probands, and LpA-I and LpA-I:A-II were lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> and FTgHA probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ApoB levels were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> familial HA groups compared with the reference group, being highest in FCH individuals, but not significantly higher between FCH, FTgHA, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LpB:E levels were higher in the FCH and FTgHA groups than in the reference group </plain></SENT>
