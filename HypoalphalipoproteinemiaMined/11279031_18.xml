<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The zinc finger gene 202 (ZNF202) located within a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> susceptibility locus on chromosome 11q23 is a transcriptional repressor of various genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To provide further evidence for a functional linkage between ZNF202 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, we investigated the effect of ZNF202 expression on ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 is a key regulator of the plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> pool size, whereas ABCG1 is another mediator of cellular cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux in human macrophage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here that the full-length ZNF202m1 isoform binds to GnT repeats within the promotors of ABCA1 (-229/-210) and ABCG1 (-572/-552) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ZNF202m1 expression in HepG2 cells dose-dependently repressed the promotor activities of ABCA1 and ABCG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This transcriptional effect required the presence of the SCAN domain in ZNF202 and the functional integrity of a TATA box at position -24 of ABCA1, whereas the presence of GnT binding motifs was nonessential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The state of ZNF202 SCAN domain oligomerization affected the ability of the adjacent ZNF202 Kr√ºppel-associated box domain to recruit the transcriptional corepressor KAP1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of ZNF202m1 in RAW264.7 macrophages prevented the induction of ABCA1 gene expression by 20(S)OH-cholesterol and 9-cis-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>, further substantiating the interference of ZNF202 in critical elements of transcriptional activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and apoAImediated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> efflux was significantly reduced in RAW264.7 cells stably expressing ZNF202m1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified ABCA1 and ABCG1 as target genes for ZNF202-mediated repression and thus, provide evidence for a functional linkage between ZNF202 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
