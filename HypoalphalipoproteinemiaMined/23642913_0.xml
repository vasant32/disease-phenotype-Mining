<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> and antiretroviral treatment on surrogate markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism were evaluated in a 12 month prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Treatment-naive HIV patients were recruited into one of three groups: untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> not likely to require initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 12 months; initiating treatment with non <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33838">nucleoside</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53756">reverse transcriptase inhibitor</z:chebi>-containing ART regimen and initiating treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi>-containing ART regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent assessment of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and variables of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> metabolism at baseline and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings were compared with published values for age and sex matched HIV-negative healthy subjects in a cross-sectional fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>cIMT and FMD were lower while PWV was higher in HIV-patients compared with HIV-negative individuals; none of the markers changed significantly during 12 months follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HIV patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> and elevated plasma levels of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> transfer protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only significant changes in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-related variables were elevation of total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in patients treated with PI-containing regimen and elevation of plasma LCAT levels in patients treated with NNRTI-containing regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ability of whole and apoB-depleted plasma to effect cholesterol efflux was not impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and deterioration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidaemia</z:e> in HIV patients within 1 year </plain></SENT>
