<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the main steps of the antiatherogenic pathway called reverse cholesterol transport in a group of patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in comparison to normotriglyceridemic subjects with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels were accompanied by decreased apo A-I and apo A-II concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These reductions were manifested by a selective reduction in LpA-I:A-II particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, apo C-III Lp non B was found to be elevated and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> percentage composition showed a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> enrichment and cholesterol <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The capacity of serum samples from hypertriglyceridemic patients to promote cellular cholesterol efflux was reduced, as evidenced by using two different cellular models, Fu5AH and J774 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This impaired cholesterol efflux promotion was also corroborated by incubations of isolated <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> fractions with Fu5AH cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, the driving force of reverse cholesterol transport, showed a tendency towards lower values in hypertriglyceridemic patients, but this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> transfer protein (CETP) activity was increased in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> was found to induce quantitative and qualitative alterations in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and its subclasses and, consequently, in some steps of reverse cholesterol transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities found in this antiatherogenic pathway and its promoters could constitute a possible connection between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
