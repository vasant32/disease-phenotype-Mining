<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The prevalence of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities was assessed in 2941 people, including 1396 males and 1545 females, aged more than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population is representative of Iranian urban adults living in northwestern Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to isolated forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, some dyslipidemic phenotypes including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>/low <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) combination, mixed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemias</z:e>, and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemias</z:e> were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most prevalent abnormality was <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>; 73% including 63% for men and 93.3% for women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>Hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> (&gt;150 mg/dL) was the second most prevalent abnormality (40.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>Increased total cholesterol</z:hpo> (&gt;200 mg/dL) was observed in 35.4% of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> was observed in 9.9% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty eight percent of the low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> cases were not accompanied with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and 24.4% of hypertriglyceridemic subjects had low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among subjects younger than 30 years, 19% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, 13% had isolated low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> less than 35 mg/dL, and 63% had <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> less than 40 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, except for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>/low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> pattern, which was more common in males, the other abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles were more common in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo>, in Iranian adults is very high </plain></SENT>
