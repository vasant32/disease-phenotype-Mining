<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the metabolism of postprandial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in HPAL/HTG subjects (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They had a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol level &lt; 0.9 mmol/l, a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) level of 2.0-7.1 mmol/l, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol level (&lt; 3.7 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were either homozygous for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> E3 (n = 13) or heterozygous for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> E4 (n = 5) or E2 (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After ingestion of a vitamin A fat load, plasma and chylomicron (CM) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15040">retinyl palmitate</z:chebi> (RP) response (areas under curves) was three times and non-CM RP response 2.5 times greater than in normolipidemic control subjects (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was close correlation between fasting plasma TG level and postprandial RP response in HPAL/HTG subjects (plasma, r = 0.87; CM, r = 0.89; and non-CM, r = 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control subjects this correlation was present for plasma RP (r = 0.80) and CM RP (r = 0.61) but not for non-CM RP (r = 0.53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, postprandial RP response was not correlated with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation between fasting TG and fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postheparin <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase and hepatic lipase activities were slightly higher in HPAL/HTG subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pattern of postprandial change in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> composition was similar to that in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate enhanced postprandial <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>lipemia</z:mp> in the HPAL/HTG syndrome, and this may account for their increased CAD risk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
