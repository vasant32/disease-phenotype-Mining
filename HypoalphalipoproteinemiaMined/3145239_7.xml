<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A single 51-member kindred, ascertained on the basis of a normotriglyceridemic proband with depressed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> at ages 40 and 42, was studied with respect to quantitative variation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) AI and AII levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of bivariate segregation analysis suggest that the etiology of depressed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> involves one or possibly two major loci: one has a pleiotropic effect on apo AI and apo AII levels and, possibly another one that affects apo AI levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both the major loci were characterized as having a dominant allele leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the respective trait(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of the cosegregation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and apo AI levels gave evidence of residual nonfamilial factors common to both traits, leading to a positive covariance between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This could reflect the role of apo AI in the transformation of nascent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> particles into mature ones via its cofactor activity to lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed two-locus model represents one possible etiology for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This analysis of a single pedigree does not completely define the genetic mechanism, but it does illustrate a useful new analytic approach </plain></SENT>
