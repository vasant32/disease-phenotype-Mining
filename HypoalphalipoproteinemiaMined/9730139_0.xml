<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the association between the LPL gene and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels, we studied two polymorphisms (Hind III and Pvu II) and three mutations (Asn291Ser, Gly188Glu and LPL(Arita)) of the LPL gene in 114 children with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels (&lt;40 mg/dl) and 194 control children using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the Pvu II +/+ genotype was significantly higher in the children with low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/high-TG (TG&gt;100 mg/dl, 90th percentile level among Japanese schoolchildren) than in the other children (vs the low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-TG children, chi2 = 7.49, p &lt; 0.01; vs control children, chi2 = 7.23, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pvu II+ allele of the LPL gene was associated with elevated TG levels in low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found one heterozygote of LPL(Arita) (deletion of G at base 916 in exon 5, the most common mutation of LPL deficiency in Japanese), among the low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/high-TG subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other two variants were not detected in either the low-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> children or control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LPL Asn291Ser and Gly188Glu have been presumed to be rare in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> with elevated TG level may be associated with genetic variations of the LPL gene </plain></SENT>
