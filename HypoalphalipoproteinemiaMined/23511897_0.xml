<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While there is evidence against a role for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>), it is unresolved whether <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) contributes to adrenal steroidogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study this, steroid hormone profiles in urine were assessed in male subjects suffering from functional mutations in ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (n = 24), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (n = 40), as well as in 11 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) without ABCA1/LCAT mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels were 39% lower in the ABCA1, LCAT, and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> groups compared with controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels, urinary excretion of 17-ketogenic steroids was reduced by 33%, 27%, and 32% compared with controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven carriers of either type of mutation, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation did not reveal differences from normolipidemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study shows that basal but not stimulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> metabolism is attenuated in subjects with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, irrespective of its molecular origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings lend support to a role for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> as a cholesterol donor for basal adrenal steroidogenesis in humans </plain></SENT>
