<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of the plasma radioactivity curves demonstrated that the mutant apoA-IIowa was rapidly cleared from plasma (mean fractional catabolic rate [FCR] 0.559 day-1) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I (mean FCR 0.244 day-1) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The FCR of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I was also substantially faster in the heterozygous apoA-IIowa subjects (mean FCR 0.281 days-1) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean FCR 0.203 days-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the rapid removal from plasma of apoA-IIowa, the cumulative urinary excretion of its associated radioactivity after 2 weeks (44%) of the injected dose) was substantially less than that associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I (78% of injected dose), indicating extravascular sequestration of radiolabeled apoA-IIowa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
