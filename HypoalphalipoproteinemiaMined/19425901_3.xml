<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: National guidelines recommend treating low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and/or high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) with adjunctive therapy that supplements <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> monotherapy in patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Niacin and fibrates have been shown in clinical trials to be effective as adjunctive therapy for these <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacologic treatment of low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and high TG in real-world practice by assessing a large managed-care population with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors enrolled in a commercial health plan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Research design and methods: Complete <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> panel results (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, TG) obtained between 1/1/2006 and 12/31/2006 (index lab) were available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were observed 180 days pre-index to determine which <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors were present (male aged 45+, female 55+, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients whose <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was at goal but who had low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and high TG were assessed for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> treatment status by evaluating outpatient pharmacy claims 6 months pre- and post-index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Treatment with any <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> therapy increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk groups, and by total risk factors, from pre-index to post-index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of fibrates and niacin, alone or in combination with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi>, also increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> risk groups, and by total risk factors as well, but was below expectations based on guideline recommendations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For example, among patients with 4 risk factors, &lt;20% of patients with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>/high TG received niacin and/or a fibrate post-index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that in actual clinical practice, niacin and fibrates are underutilized in the treatment of low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and high TG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study must be considered within the limitations of database analysis as claims data are collected for the purpose of payment and not research </plain></SENT>
