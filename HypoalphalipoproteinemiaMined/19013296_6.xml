<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated the role of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> transfer protein (PLTP) gene variation (rs2294213) in determining levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (HypoA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have now explored the role of PLTP in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (HyperA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The human PLTP gene was screened for sequence anomalies by DNA melting in 107 subjects with HyperA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association with plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We detected 7 sequence variations: 1 previously reported variation (rs2294213) and 5 novel mutations including 1 missense mutation (L106F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PLTP activity was unchanged in the p.L106F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the rs2294213 minor allele was markedly increased in the HyperA group (7.0%) in comparison with a control group (4.3%) and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> group (2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rs2294213 was strongly associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linear regression models predict that possession of the rs2294213 minor allele increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> independent of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings extend the association of rs2294213 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels into the extremes of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> distribution </plain></SENT>
