<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: a survey was carried out among college students and general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A structured interview was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile from subjects considered to be healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: we included 1286 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were grouped by socioeconomic status (low income = 437, medium income = 162 and high income = 133) and 554 college students who had lived in the area for at least one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women composed 61 % of the cohort; 86 % of the cases were studied after an overnight fasting period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phenotype was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, followed by mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among medium income group, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> was a common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and low c-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were observed among the low income group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Male gender and age are predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The BMI is the only identified predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> (OR = 10.089) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We identified that age &gt; 55-year old (OR = 2.6), male gender (OR = 1.6), and sedentary life (OR = 1.35), were predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: the most common <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phenotype was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
