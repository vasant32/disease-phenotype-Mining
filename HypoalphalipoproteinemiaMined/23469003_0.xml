<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The zinc finger protein Znf202 is a transcriptional suppressor of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> related genes and has been linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A functional role of Znf202 in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism in vivo still remains to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated mouse Znf202 expression vectors, the functionality of which was established in several in vitro systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next, effects of adenoviral znf202 overexpression in vivo were determined in normo- as well as hyperlipidemic mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Znf202 overexpression in mouse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cells mhAT3F2 resulted in downregulation of members of the Apoe/c1/c2 and Apoa1/c3/a4 gene cluster </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The repressive activity of Znf202 was firmly confirmed in an apoE reporter assay and Znf202 responsive elements within the ApoE promoter were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adenoviral Znf202 transfer to Ldlr-/- mice resulted in downregulation of apoe, apoc1, apoa1, and apoc3 within 24 h after gene transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, key genes in bile flux (abcg5/8 and bsep) and in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3098">bile acid</z:chebi> synthesis (cyp7a1) were also downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 5 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the expression of the aforementioned genes was normalized, but mice had developed severe hepatosteatosis accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A much milder phenotype was observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice after 5 days of hepatic Znf202 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interestingly and similar to Ldl-/- mice, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wildtype</z:mp> mice were lowered after hepatic Znf202 overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONSIGNIFICANCE: Znf202 overexpression in vivo reveals an important role of this transcriptional regulator in liver <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis, while firmly establishing the proposed key role in the control of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
