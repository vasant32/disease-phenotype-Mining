<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the genetic defects in two patients with familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical manifestations including <z:hpo ids='HP_0007759'>corneal opacities</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> were identical for familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268239" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">LCAT deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their LCAT activities and the cholesterol esterification rate (CER) were nearly zero, and their LCAT masses were below 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the amplified DNA of case 1 revealed one base deletion of G at base 873 (first position of Val264) in exon 6, leading to a premature termination by frameshift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of amplified DNA of case 2 revealed a single G to A converting Gly (GGT) to Ser (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGT</z:e>) substitution at residue 344 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When COS-1 cells were transfected with these mutants, LCAT activity in the medium was nearly zero, and the LCAT mass was undetectable (&lt; 0.01 microgram/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, LCAT activity in the medium of COS-1 cells, transfected with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LCAT, was 1.7 nmol/h per ml and the LCAT mass was 0.09 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LCAT mass in the cell lysates of the mutants was less than 12% of control for case 1 and 18% of control for case 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Northern blot analysis of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of COS-1 cells transfected with the mutants showed the same amounts of LCAT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> as compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LCAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biosynthesis of mutant LCATs was analyzed by pulse-chase and immunocytochemistry in transfected baby hamster kidney cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE/fluorography demonstrated that <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LCAT was synthesized as a high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> type of 56 kDa, which was very slowly converted to a mature form of 67 kDa and was secreted into the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LCAT, the mutant precursors were not processed into the mature form but slowly degraded along with chase times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On steady and continuous labeling in the case of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> LCAT, the mature 67 kDa form was observed in both the cell lysate and media, whereas no mature form was detected in the cell lysates and media which were transfected mutant LCATs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the mutant LCATs are actually synthesized in an amount comparable to that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, but they are slowly degraded without being processed into the mature form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The immunocytochemistry revealed that mutant LCATs were mainly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that these two mutations may disrupt the mutant LCATs' transport from the endoplasmic reticulum into Golgi apparatus, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268239" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">LCAT deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
