<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To better assess the link between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels and C-reactive protein levels and the possible role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> as putative mediators of this relationship, we studied a population sample with nonselected causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six consecutive patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels below 40 mg/dL who attend our <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> clinic and 86 control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> concentrations matched for gender, age, smoking habit, and weight were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels were 34 +/- 3.9 and 55.4 +/- 8.8 mg/dL for subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> and control subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
