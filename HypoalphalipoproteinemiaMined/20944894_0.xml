<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Altered <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profiles are related to a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> and investigate its association with overweight and abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in adolescent students from Recife, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Personal data, socioeconomic level, anthropometric measurements and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile of 470 adolescents, aged 10 to 14 years, of both sexes, students at the Public School system in the city of Recife, state of Pernambuco, Brazil, were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis was carried out using the Epi-info 6.04 and SPSS 13.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of significance was set at 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of the population was dyslipidemic (63.8%; 95%CI: 59.3 - 68.2), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> being the most prevalent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> (56%; 95%CI: 51.3 - 60.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adolescents who were overweight or who had abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> presented higher levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and lower levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of total cholesterol and fractions were not different between sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high incidence of unfavorable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile was shown in this series, demonstrating the necessity to measure the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile as early as this age range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Healthy lifestyle measures should be encouraged in this population </plain></SENT>
