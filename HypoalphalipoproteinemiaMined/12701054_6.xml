<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (Hyper-A) is a characterized by high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> concentrations and is possibly associated with longevity and protection against CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whether plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level, an emerging marker of CHD risk, may be influenced by either extremely low or high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> concentrations is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and CRP have been measured in 52 middle-aged men and women, clinically free of CHD, including 20 subjects with Hypo-A, 12 with Hyper-A, and 20 healthy normolipemic age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CRP levels were the highest in Hypo-A [0.22 mg/dL (interquartile range, 0.15 to 0.44)], the lowest in Hyper-A [0.03 mg/dL (0.02 to 0.07)], and intermediate in the control group [0.10 mg/dL (0.05 to 0.20)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in plasma CRP concentrations were significant between Hypo-A and the other 2 groups, as well as between Hyper-A and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma CRP levels showed a particularly strong correlation with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> concentrations (r = -.66, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> represented the only significant predictor of circulating levels of CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in subjects with Hypo-A or Hyper-A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels may account for plasma CRP variations independent of other potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
