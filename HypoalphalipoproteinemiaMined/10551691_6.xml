<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Serum low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> are independent predictors for CHD, but a strong negative correlation exists between them, as in patients with syndrome X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four pairs of cases (M/F: 49/5), defined as patients with angiographically proved CHD, and control subjects (M/F: 49/5) matched with cases with regard to gender and age were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin resistance</z:hpo> was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cases had increased HOMA <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and lower serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were significant discriminators of CHD (area under ROC curve: 0.72 and 0.69, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with CHD was significant: subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> had no increased risk of CHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that hyperinsulinemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> was a stronger indicator for CHD than either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> alone (-2 log likelihood: 19.0 vs. 12.6 or 15.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hyperinsulinemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> was a more potent indicator for CHD than either <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or low serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels alone, and the adverse effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> seem to be ameliorated by high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
