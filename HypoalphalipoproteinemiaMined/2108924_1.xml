<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 (APOA1) gene variant has been identified in a family ascertained through a proband undergoing coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The variant, ApoA1 Baltimore, was due to a mutation at codon 34 of the third exon of the APOA1 gene (CGA to CTA) that resulted in an arginine-to-leucine substitution at the tenth amino acid of the mature ApoA1 and a change in charge of -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutation abolishes a TaqI restriction site and it is easily detectable after polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband was heterozygous for the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight other members of the pedigree had the same ApoA1 variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cosegregation of the variant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> could not be demonstrated and the association of this mutation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> was confined to three affected members of the nuclear family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No effect of the mutant on any <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> phenotype could be established </plain></SENT>
