<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CESD patients have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> associated with mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and low plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was the molecular characterization of three patients with CESD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAL activity was measured in blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients (twin sisters) the clinical diagnosis of CESD was made at 9 years of age, following the fortuitous discovery of elevated serum liver enzymes in apparently healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo>, reduced LAL activity (approximately 5% of control) and heteroalleic mutations in LIPA gene coding sequence: (i) the common c.894 G&gt;A mutation and (ii) a novel nonsense mutation c.652 C&gt;T (p.R218X) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other patient was an 80 year-old female who for several years had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> associated with low plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this patient the sequence of major candidate genes for monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was found to be a compound heterozygote for two LIPA gene mutations resulting in 5% LAL activity: (i) c.894 G&gt;A and (ii) a novel complex insertion/deletion leading to a premature termination codon at position 82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that, in view of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable severity</z:hpo> of its phenotypic expression, CESD may sometimes be difficult to diagnose, but it should be considered in patients with severe type IIb <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> associated with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, mildly elevated serum liver enzymes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
