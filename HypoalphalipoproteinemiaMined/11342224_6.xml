<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Zinc-finger transcription factors are often accompanied by modular sequence motifs such as the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) and the SCAN domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The KRAB domain mediates transcriptional repression while the SCAN domain mediates selective protein dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> susceptibility gene ZNF202 encodes a SCAN box and a KRAB domain followed by eight Cys2-His2 zinc-finger motifs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to identify the existence of genes which encode proteins of structural homology to ZNF202, a mouse lambda library was screened with a human ZNF202 cDNA probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The isolated cDNA clones represented three SCAN-domain-encoding gene families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We purified three novel cDNAs that encode a SCAN-KRAB-(Cys2-His2)x domain alignment and one cDNA that encodes a SCAN-(Cys2-His2)x domain alignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified one cDNA sequence with a predicted protein sequence containing a KRAB-SCAN-KRAB-(Cys2-His2)x domain alignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when combined with the recently discovered family of isolated SCAN-domain-encoding genes, four SCAN domain gene families can be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The consensus sequences for the murine SCAN and KRAB domains are highly conserved within the mammalian phylogenetic tree which may be useful in elucidating the biological function of these protein modules and the crucial residues responsible for their binding specificity </plain></SENT>
