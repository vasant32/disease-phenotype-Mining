<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities, as well as decreased mass and activity of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), were similar to those described in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FED">fish eye disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased number of target cells and decreased osmotic fragility of the proband's erythrocytes were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proband's father and one of his brothers showed intermediate plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and LCAT alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The father's erythrocytes also showed abnormal osmotic fragility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mother of the propositus had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and erythrocyte osmotic fragility, but her LCAT activity was also low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Many of these features suggest a disorder similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0342895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FED">fish eye disease</z:e> which is clinically and biochemically distinct from other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
