<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to identify genetic factors underlying extreme alterations of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) concentrations, we examined two probands with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels &lt;0.2 mmol/L and subsequently screened two large cohorts of smoking men, one with very low (0.2 to 0.7 mmol/L, n=156) and the other with elevated (1.9 to 3.6 mmol/L, n=160) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels, for the newly detected mutations as well as some other mutations proposed to affect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the probands had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007759'>corneal opacities</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and reduced <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> B concentration; the other had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004446'>stomatocytosis</z:hpo> in his peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first proband was found to be homozygous for a novel LCAT Gly230Arg (LCAT[Fin]) mutation, and the second was homozygous for an Arg399Cys mutation we described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient expression of the mutant LCAT(Fin) cDNA in COS cells disclosed markedly diminished LCAT enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the low-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> group of men (n=156), 8 carriers of LCAT(Fin) and 1 carrier of the LCAT Arg399Cys were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequency of the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase (LPL) Asn291Ser mutation was significantly (P&lt;.05) higher in the low-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> group (4.8%) than in the high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> group (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we identified 1 carrier of the intron 14G--&gt;A mutation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17002">cholesterol ester</z:chebi> transfer protein (CETP) in the high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> group and subsequently demonstrated cosegregation of the mutant allele with elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in the proband's family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified a novel LCAT gene Gly230Arg mutation (LCAT[Fin]), which, together with the LPL Asn291Ser mutation, represents a relatively common genetic cause of diminishing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels, at least among Finns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This article also reports occurrence of a CETP mutation in subjects having non-Japanese roots </plain></SENT>
