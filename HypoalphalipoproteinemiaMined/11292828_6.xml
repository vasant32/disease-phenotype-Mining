<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have devised a combined in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro approach to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in heterozygous carriers of a naturally occurring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (apoA-I) variant (Leu(159) to Arg) known as apoA-I Finland (apoA-I(FIN)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adenovirus-mediated expression of apoA-I(FIN) decreased apoA-I and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> concentrations in both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> C57BL/6J mice and in apoA-I-deficient mice expressing native human apoA-I (hapoA-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, apoA-I(FIN) was degraded in the plasma, and the extent of proteolysis correlated with the most significant reductions in murine apoA-I concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I(FIN) had impaired activation of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in vitro compared with hapoA-I, but in a mixed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> preparation consisting of both hapoA-I and apoA-I(FIN) there was only a moderate reduction in the activation of this enzyme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Importantly, secretion of apoA-I was also decreased from primary apoA-I-deficient hepatocytes when hapoA-I was co-expressed with apoA-I(FIN) following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with recombinant adenoviruses, a condition that mimics secretion in heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, this is the first demonstration of an apoA-I point mutation that decreases LCAT activation, impairs hepatocyte secretion of apoA-I, and makes apoA-I susceptible to proteolysis leading to dominantly inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
