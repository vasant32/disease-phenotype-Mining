<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The screening was performed within framework of the international WHO-MONICA Project in 1984 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1309 men and 1337 women were screened (response rate 72.7% and 74.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized mean values of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> concentration were found significantly higher and those of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration significantly lower in male than in female sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In men there was also higher the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized mean values of plasma total cholesterol concentration and prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> did not differ significantly between men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean values of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentration and prevalence of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism disturbances increased with age in men whereas in men such trend was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The influence of selected factors on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> plasma concentration was evaluated by means of multivariate regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quetelet index, cigarettes smoking and level of education were the most strongly associated with a <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> pattern which increases risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> both in men and women </plain></SENT>
