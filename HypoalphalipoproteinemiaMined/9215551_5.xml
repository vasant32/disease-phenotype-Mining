<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we analyzed the distribution of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subclasses in plasmas of four hemizygotes for this mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the abilities of these plasmas to esterify cholesterol and to promote cholesterol efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Residual apoA-I-containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> in plasmas of hemizygotes for apoA-I(L141R)Pisa correspond to pre beta 1-LpA-I and small alpha-LpA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pre beta 1-LpA-I, pre beta 1-LpA-I of apoA-I(L141R)Pisa hemizygotes was not converted into a larger alpha-migrating particle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasmas of apoA-I(L141R)Pisa hemizygotes were significantly reduced in their activity to esterify cholesterol in either endogenous or exogenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol efflux capacity was significantly lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Efflux of [3H] cholesterol from radiolabeled fibroblasts into apoB-depleted plasma of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> probands was biphasic with fast cholesterol efflux occurring in the first minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, cholesterol efflux was slow and unsaturable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After incubation with radiolabeled fibroblasts, efflux values of [3H]cholesterol into apoB-depleted plasma from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and from apoA-I(L141R)Pisa hemizygotes were indistinguishable at 1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer incubations with apoB-free plasma from apoA-I(L141R)Pisa hemizygotes did not, however, lead to the unsaturable increase in cholesterol efflux that was observed during incubations with apoB-free plasma of normolipidemic probands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre beta 1-LpA-I of apoA-I(L141R)Pisa hemizygotes took up significantly less cell-derived [3H]cholesterol than pre beta 1-LpA-I of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that apoA-I(L141R)Pisa interferes with the formation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-rich alpha-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> but not with that of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-poor pre beta 1-LpA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Very low concentrations of alpha-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> in plasmas of apoA-I(L141R)Pisa hemizygotes combined with reduced LCAT activity cause a decrease of the slow, unspecific, and LCAT-dependent components of cholesterol efflux into plasma </plain></SENT>
