<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five hundred forty-one individuals participating in a study concerning factors of cardiovascular risk were included in the present study which consisted in a survey on risk factors and a medical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population studied was divided according to the concentration of total cholesterol (TC) in desirable concentrations (5.2 mmol/l), intermediate (5.2-6.2 mmol/l) and elevated (6.2 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of cholesterol bound to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (cHDL) less than 0.9 mmol/l and of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TG) greater than 2.3 mmol/l were considered as high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> would not be detected in 2.9% of the population studied (IC 95%: 1.5%-4.3%) and isolated triglyceridemia in 2.4% (IC 95%: 1.1%-3.7%) if the cHDL and the TG were only determined in the individuals who had high or elevated CT concentrations and two or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data support the efficacy of CT as the only test for initial detection of dyslipemia and question the convenience of initial quantification of cHDL and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases as some authors request </plain></SENT>
