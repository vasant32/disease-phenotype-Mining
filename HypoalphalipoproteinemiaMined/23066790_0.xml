<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Iowa point mutation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (G26R) leads to a systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> condition, and the Milano mutation (R173C) is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, a reduced plasma level of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To probe the structural effects that lead to these outcomes, we used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi> hydrogen-<z:chebi fb="5" ids="29237">deuterium</z:chebi> exchange coupled with a fragment separation/mass spectrometry analysis (HX MS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Iowa mutation inserts an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32700">arginine residue</z:chebi> into the nonpolar face of an α-helix that spans residues 7-44 and causes changes in structure and structural dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This helix unfolds, and other helices in the N-terminal helix bundle domain are destabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The segment encompassing residues 116-158, largely unstructured in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I, becomes helical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The helix spanning residues 81-115 is destabilized by 2 kcal/mol, increasing the small fraction of time it is transiently unfolded to ≥1%, which allows proteolysis at residue 83 in vivo over time, releasing an amyloid-forming <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Milano mutation situated on the polar face of the helix spanning residues 147-178 destabilizes the helix bundle domain only moderately, but enough to allow cysteine-mediated dimerization that leads to the altered functionality of this variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results show how the HX MS approach can provide a powerful means of monitoring, in a nonperturbing way and at close to amino acid resolution, the structural, dynamic, and energetic consequences of biologically interesting point mutations </plain></SENT>
