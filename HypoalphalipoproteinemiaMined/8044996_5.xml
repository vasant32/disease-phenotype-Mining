<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) in plasma of 110 subjects, using three different methods: (a) gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE); (b) electroimmunoassay, to measure the concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> particles containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) AI but no apo-AII (LP AI); and (c) cholesterol esterification rate (FERHDL) in very-low- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low-density lipoprotein</z:chebi>-depleted plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were two study groups: patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, whose plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile was similar to their respective controls, and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (hypoalpha), whose family members served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Values for FERHDL were significantly higher in both risk groups than in their respective controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LP AI was significantly decreased only in the hypoalpha subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Generally, LP AI and FERHDL were inversely related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LP AI correlated strongly with plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, apo AI, and LP AI/AII; FERHDL correlated with those values inversely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LP AI, but not FERHDL, correlated with <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> free cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, FERHDL correlated strongly with plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and with the plasma ratio of total/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> while LP AI did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GGE determination of the composition of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subspecies showed that both FERHDL and LP AI were significantly related to the content of HDL2b particles: FERHDL inversely, LP AI directly; the relative amount of HDL3b,c particles correlated only with FERHDL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GGE and FERHDL can be used to quantify both the apparently protective (HDL2b) and risk-associated (HDL3b,c) particles, whereas the concentration of LP AI in plasma mainly reflects the concentration of the HDL2 subpopulation </plain></SENT>
