<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Healthy men with the lowest, median, and highest deciles of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> were selected from a large population database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We accounted for factors that are known to influence <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels, such as smoking, exercise, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma CETP concentrations were measured, and we determined the allele frequency distribution of six CETP DNA polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> exhibited a significant increase in CETP concentration compared with both the median and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> groups, whereas CETP concentrations did not differ among the groups with median and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency distributions of the TaqIB (intron 1), Msp I (intron 8), and Rsa I (exon 14) polymorphisms differed significantly between the groups with low and high <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed that the Msp I polymorphism had a 1.5-fold larger impact on CETP concentration than the TaqIB polymorphism and a fivefold larger impact than the Rsa I polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> at the CETP gene locus is correlated with CETP plasma concentrations and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More specifically, our data indicate the presence of a strong association between common variants of the CETP gene, high plasma CETP concentrations, and consequently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in healthy white men </plain></SENT>
