<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated a proband with very low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, 6 mg/dL) and a history of premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the ABCA1 gene revealed 2 distinct variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first mutation was a G5947A substitution (R1851Q) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second mutation was a single-nucleotide deletion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> in a polypyrimidine tract located 33 to 46 bps upstream to the start of exon 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This mutation does not involve the 3' acceptor splice site and is outside the lariat branchpoint sequence (IVS46: del T -39...-46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amplification of cDNA obtained in cultured fibroblasts of the proband and affected family member revealed an abnormally spliced cDNA sequence with skipping of exon 47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These variants were not identified in over 400 chromosomes of healthy whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compound heterozygotes (n=4) exhibited the lowest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (11+/-5 mg/dL) and ApoA-I (35+/-15 mg/dL) compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (n=25) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> 51+/-14 mg/dL; ApoA-I 133+/-21 mg/dL) (P&lt;0.0005) or subjects affected with either R1851Q (n=6) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> 36+/-8; ApoA-I 117+/-19) or IVS46: del T -39...-46 (n=5) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> 31+9; ApoA-I 115+28 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that polypyrimidine tract variation may represent a novel mechanism for altered splicing and exon skipping that is independent of traditional intronic variants as previously identified in acceptor/donor splice regions or the lariat branchpoint domain </plain></SENT>
