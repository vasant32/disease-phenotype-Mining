<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> to remove cholesterol from peripheral cells and drive it to the liver for excretion is believed to explain most of the strong inverse correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carriers of the ApoA-IMilano (A-IM) mutant have a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> but are not at increased risk for premature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explain this apparent paradox, we compared the capacity of serum from A-IM and control subjects to extract cholesterol from Fu5AH cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the A-IM carriers are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heterozygotes for the mutation, we also compared the cholesterol efflux capacity of serum from transgenic mice expressing A-IM or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> ApoA-I (A-IWT), in the absence of murine ApoA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the whole series of human or mouse sera, cholesterol efflux was significantly correlated with several <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-related parameters; after adjustment for concomitant variables, the only parameter that remained significantly correlated with cholesterol efflux was the serum ApoA-I concentration (r2=0.85 in humans and 0.84 in mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same was true when samples from control subjects, A-IM carriers, A-IWT or A-IM mice were analyzed separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol efflux to sera from the A-IM carriers was only reduced slightly compared with control sera (25.0+/-4.2% versus 30.4+/-3.3%), although there was a large reduction (-45%) in the serum ApoA-I concentration in the former </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol efflux was also lower to sera from A-IM than A-IWT mice (15.6+/-3.8% versus 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1+/-7.1%), but less than expected from the 70% reduction in serum ApoA-I concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A relative efflux potential of serum was calculated in each group as the slope of the regression line fitting cholesterol efflux to ApoA-I concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the relative efflux potential reflects the relative efficiency of ApoA-I in determining cell cholesterol efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relative efflux potential of mouse and human sera was in the following order: A-IM mice&gt;A-IM carriers&gt;A-IWT mice=control subjects, suggesting a gene-dosage effect of the A-IM mutation on the efficiency of serum to extract cholesterol from cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The high efficiency of A-IM-containing <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> for cell cholesterol uptake would result in an improved reverse cholesterol transport in the A-IM carriers, possibly explaining the low susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
