<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a three generation family with co-dominant monogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband, a 48 year-old male, was found to be heterozygous for a previously reported mutation in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R) gene (IVS15-3 c&gt;a) and a novel mutation in exon 6 of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) gene (c.803 G&gt;A) causing a non-synonymous amino acid substitution (p.R244H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations segregated independently in the family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R mutation was associated with high levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (6.20-9.85 mmol/L) and apo B (170-255 mg/dL), comparable to those previously reported in carriers of the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LCAT mutation was associated with low levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (0.67-0.80 mmol/L) and apo A-I (96-110 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proband had reduced LCAT function, as measured by cholesterol esterification rate (29 nmol/(mL/h) versus 30-60 nmol/(mL/h)), LCAT activity (10 nmol/(mL/h) versus 20-55 nmol/(mL/h)) and LCAT mass (2.87 microg/mL versus 3.1-6.7 microg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carriers of LCAT mutation had lower LCAT activity and a tendency to reduced cholesterol esterification rate (CER) and LCAT mass as compared to non-carrier family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LCAT mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and 60 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the unfavourable <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile, the proband had only mild clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This unexpected finding is probably due to the intensive <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> lowering treatment the patient has been on over the last decade </plain></SENT>
