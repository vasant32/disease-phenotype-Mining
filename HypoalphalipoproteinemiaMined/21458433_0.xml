<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>L75P is a variant of apoA-I associated with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> predominantly involving the liver, kidneys, and testis, identified in a large number of unrelated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective of the present paper was to evaluate the impact of the L75P apoA-I variant on <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subpopulations and cholesterol esterification in carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma samples were collected from 30 carriers of the amyloidogenic L75P apoA-I (Carriers) and from 15 non affected relatives (Controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carriers displayed significantly reduced plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, apoA-I, and apoA-II compared to Controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of LpA-I, but not LpA-I:A-II, were significantly reduced in Carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subclass distribution was not affected by the presence of the variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unesterified to total cholesterol ratio was higher, and cholesterol esterification rate and LCAT activity were lower in Carriers than in Controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The L75P apoA-I variant is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, a selective reduction of LpA-I particles, and a partial defect in cholesterol esterification </plain></SENT>
