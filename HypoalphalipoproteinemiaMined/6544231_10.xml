<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence for segregation of a recessive major gene for depressed <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c with frequency q = 0.116, in addition to multifactorial transmission (H = 0.572), is found in these families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reanalysis of a subset of families with severely depressed <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-c confirms the conclusions based on the original analysis, except that different definitions of "affection" give rise to different estimates of gene frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our finding of a recessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> differs from previous claims for a dominant gene because previous analyses did not use a mixed model for segregation analysis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the significant multifactorial background is neglected, we also find evidence for the invalid claim of a dominant gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates the necessity of using mixed models for determining the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> of a given phenotype </plain></SENT>
