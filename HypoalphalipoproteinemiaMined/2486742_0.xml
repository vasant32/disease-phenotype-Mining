<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Probands were ten patients referred to the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> Clinic of the National Institute of Cardiology for evaluation of their <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom had history of a definite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurring before they had reached age 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their only plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormality was a reduction of the cholesterol fraction associated with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) below the corresponding age-sex specific fifth percentile </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants were clinically examined and their complete coronary risk factor profile was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a 12 hour fast, plasma samples were obtained for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> analysis, total cholesterol and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">tr</z:e>Ã¯<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47778">glycerides</z:chebi> were measured by enzymatic methods, C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was determined in the supernatant after plasma precipitation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="6636">magnesium chloride</z:chebi>: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53394">phosphotungstic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For every family a pedigree was constructed and statistically analyzed to assess the within-family clustering of low C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels and the pattern of transmission of the abnormal phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> level for propositii was 24.3 mg/dl, the corresponding value for the C-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>/C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> ratio (atherogenic index) was 4.9 and it was elevated above 3.5 (average coronary risk) in 7/10 (70%) of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>Obesity</z:hpo>, defined by a Quetelet index above 28 in men and 26 in women was present in 4/10 (40%) of the probands, 3/10 (30%) had stable non <z:hpo ids='HP_0100651'>insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, prevalence figures for the other coronary risk factors was very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to probands, the hypoalphalipoproteinemic phenotype was found in 30/57 (52.6%) subjects including spouses (two cases) and first-degree relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For these 30 cases the mean C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> value was 32 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ten reported kindred, we clearly observed either horizontal, vertical or both types of within-family transmission of the aberrant phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This finding was considered to be most compatible with the presence of a primary genetic abnormality affecting C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these kindreds in spite of the fact that some of the probands had some conditions like <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> that are sometimes associated with secondary reductions of C-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Due to the lack of a reliable biochemical marker, the distinction between primary and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in individual cases is frequently impossible, for this reason the diagnostic assessment depends on family studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
