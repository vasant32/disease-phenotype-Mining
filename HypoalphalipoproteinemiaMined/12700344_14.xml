<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in Dutch subjects suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight subjects (mean <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels 0.63 +/- 0.21 mmol/l) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts were cultured and loaded with [3H]cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 and non-ABCA1-mediated efflux was studied by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (apoA-I), <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-beta-cyclodextrin as acceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efflux to apoA-I was decreased in four patients (4/88, 4.5%), and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, a mutation in the ABCA1 gene was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 84 subjects, no correlation between efflux and apoA-I or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Efflux to both <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and cyclodextrin, in contrast, did correlate with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> plasma levels (r = 0.34, P = 0.01; and r = 0.27, P = 0.008, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of defects in ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux in Dutch <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> patients is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The significant correlation between plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-beta-cyclodextrin-mediated efflux in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ABCA1 function suggests that non-ABCA1-mediated efflux might also be important for plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in these individuals </plain></SENT>
