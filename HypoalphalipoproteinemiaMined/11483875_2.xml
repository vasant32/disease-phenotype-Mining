<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that cholesterol lowering in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> improves endothelial function, but the effect of treating low HDLc levels remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of increasing HDLc on endothelial function in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and isolated low HDLc (HDLc) &lt;0.91 mM, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (LDLc) &lt;4.1 mM, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> &lt;2.8 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (FMD) in response to reactive hyperemia was measured by brachial ultrasound, before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> treatment (400 mg daily for 6 months) in 16 patients with CAD and impaired FMD (&lt;10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> therapy, HDLc increased from 0.79-1.0 mM (p = 0.0008) at the expense of both HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I increased from 1.04-1.19 g/l (p = 0.0012), and fibrinogen decreased from 4.45-3.39 g/l (p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impaired FMD increased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> treatment from a median of 2.5-12.3% (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endothelial function was normalized in eight patients (50%), improved in four (25%), and did not change in four (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that in patients with isolated low HDLc and CAD, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">bezafibrate</z:chebi> treatment improves endothelial function of brachial arteries, increases HDLc and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I, and lowers fibrinogen concentrations </plain></SENT>
