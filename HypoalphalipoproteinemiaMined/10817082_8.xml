<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A community-based cross-sectional design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 474 elderly men aged 60-74 years in two Japanese rural communities (Noichi in southwestern Japan and Ikawa in northeastern Japan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the association between plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and the maximum intima-media thickness (assessed by ultrasonography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of thickening was 10.7% for the lowest tertile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level and 21.1% for the highest tertile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, the odds ratio for having carotid intima-media thickening was 5.8; it was significantly higher for the highest tertile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> level than it was for the lowest after adjusting for age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and smoking by using a multiple logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, its correlation was not evident for those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> are correlated to extracranial carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in elderly men without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in Japanese rural communities </plain></SENT>
