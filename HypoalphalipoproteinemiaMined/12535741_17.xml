<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to test if the ABCA1 locus is a major locus regulating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in the homogenous Finnish population with a high prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the ABCA1 locus was tested for linkage to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in 35 families with premature CHD and low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondly, 62 men with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels and CHD were screened for the five mutations known to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, polymorphisms of the ABCA1 gene were tested for an association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in a population sample of 515 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ABCA1 locus was not linked to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in the CHD families, and no carriers of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The AA596 genotype was associated with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels compared with the GG and GA genotypes in the women, but not in the men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The G596A genotypes explained 4% and the A2589G genotypes 3% of the variation in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the ABCA1 locus is of minor importance in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> in Finns </plain></SENT>
