<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carriers of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I(Milano) (apoA-I(M)) mutant present with very low plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo>, apparently not leading to premature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to establish whether this high-risk <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile is associated with structural changes in the carotid arteries and heart, indicative of preclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one A-I(M) carriers were compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects from the same kindred and with 2 series of matched subjects with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (HA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Structural changes in the carotid arteries were defined as the intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) measured by B-mode ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HA subjects, both recruited among patients attending our <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> Clinic and blood donors, showed significant thickening of the carotids (average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, 0.86+/-0.25 and 0.88+/-0.29 mm, respectively) compared with control subjects (average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, 0.64+/-0.12 mm); the apoA-I(M) carriers instead showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial thickness (average <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, 0.63+/-0.10 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significantly higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques was found in patients and blood donors with HA (both 57%) compared with apoA-I(M) carriers (33%) and control subjects (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Echocardiographic findings and maximal treadmill ECG did not differ significantly between apoA-I(M) carriers and control subjects, apart from a slight increase in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension in the carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite severe HA, carriers of the apoA-I(M) mutant do not show structural changes in the arteries and heart, in contrast to HA subjects, who are characterized by a marked increase in carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and increased prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
