<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We characterized the capacity of these variants to bind <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, to activate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and to promote efflux of biosynthetic cholesterol from porcine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or exogenous cholesterol from <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29747">cholate</z:chebi> dialysis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I and both variants associated completely with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and formed rLpA-I of identical size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, both apoA-I(P165R) and apoA-I(R160L)Oslo showed a reduced capacity to clear a turbid emulsion of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I, the LCAT-cofactor activity of apoA-I(P165R) and apoA-I(R160L)Oslo as defined by the ratio of Vmax to appKm was reduced significantly by 62% and 29%, respectively (here and throughout the text, the apparent Km is given as Michaelis-Menten kinetics do not take particle binding into account and therefore would result in errors with an interfacial enzyme such as LCAT; Vmax estimates are not affected by this error) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I/DPPC complexes induced biphasic cholesterol efflux from SMCs with a fast and a slow efflux component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared to rLpA-I reconstituted with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> apoA-I, rLpA-I with apoA-I(P165R) or apoA-I(R160L)Oslo were significantly less effective in promoting cholesterol efflux from SMCs in incubations of 10 min duration but equally effective in incubations of 6 h duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi>-free apoA-I did not induce efflux of biosynthetic cholesterol from SMCs but induced hydrolysis of cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> and cholesterol efflux from <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-free form, both apoA-I variants promoted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cholesterol efflux from murine peritoneal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that amino acid residues arginine 160 and proline 165 of apoA-I contribute to the formation of a domain that is very important for initial <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> binding and contributes to LCAT-activation and promotion of initial cholesterol efflux but not to the stabilization of preformed rLpA-I </plain></SENT>
