<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case presented several unusual features: marked infiltration of the skin and mesenteric lymph nodes by histiocytic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> with sufficient <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021843" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">intestinal occlusion</z:e> combined with an in vivo <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">TXB2</z:chebi> generation curve, subsequently inhibited by aspirin, that was comparable to the curves of the control subjects </plain></SENT>
