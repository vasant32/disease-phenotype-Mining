<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FH is also associated with significantly lower levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) A-I in both heterozygous and homozygous patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the metabolic basis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in FH has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the kinetics of apo A-I in a homozygous FH patient and two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects by using endogenous labeling with a stable isotopically labeled amino acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study subjects were administered a primed constant infusion of 13C6-phenylalanine for 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoproteins</z:chebi> were isolated from plasma drawn at selected time points and analyzed for their isotopic enrichment by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fractional catabolic rate of apo A-I in the FH subject was found to be substantially increased (0.38 day-1) compared with that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (mean, 0.26 day-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the apo A-I production rate was decreased in the FH subject (6.5 mg/kg.day-1) compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (mean, 11.1 mg/kg.day-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the low levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and apo A-I in this homozygous FH patient are due to the combined metabolic defects of increased apo A-I catabolism and decreased apo A-I production </plain></SENT>
