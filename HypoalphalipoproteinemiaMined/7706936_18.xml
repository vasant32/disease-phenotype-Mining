<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the genetic basis of type I HLP is known to be homozygosity for LPL deficiency, that for other forms of HLP, especially types IV, and V HLP, is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is also unclear whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>) overproduction can be distinguished phenotypically from that due to defective catabolism of plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study took advantage of the unique circumstances inherent in the relatively genetically isolated French Canadian population to address these questions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study was carried out in order to determine the prevalence of these three mutant LPL alleles, and of a fourth encoding LPL Asn291--&gt;Ser, in French Canadian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of heterozygosity for one of the four LPL mutant alleles in nondiabetic, nonobese hypertriglyceridemic subjects was 16 of 95 type IV HLP (17%) and 4 of 26 type V HLP cases (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These alleles were not found in over 150 normotriglyceridemic subjects, supporting the likelihood that the mutant alleles were at least partially responsible for HLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, heterozygosity for LPL deficiency due to one of these mutations apparently did not contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, and was observed in 3 of 39 subjects with type III HLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that in French Canadians, 15-20% of type IV and V HLP cases are associated with these genetic defects in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> catabolism </plain></SENT>
