<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mutations in ABCA1, a member of the ATP-binding cassette family, have been shown to underlie <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> (TD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e>), which are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> that are characterized by depressed concentrations of plasma <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An important question is whether common variants within the coding sequence of ABCA1 can affect plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we developed a screening strategy to find common ABCA1 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This strategy involved long-range amplification of genomic DNA by using coding sequences only, followed by deep sequencing into the introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method helped us to characterize a new set of amplification primers, which permitted amplification of virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the coding sequence of ABCA1 and its intron-exon boundaries with a single DNA amplification program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With these new sequencing primers, we found 3 novel ABCA1 mutations: a frameshift mutation (4570insA, A1484S--&gt;X1492), a missense mutation (A986D) in a TD family, and a missense mutation (R170C) in aboriginal subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FHA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also used these sequencing primers to characterize 4 novel common amino acid variants in ABCA1, in addition to 5 novel common silent variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We tested for association of the ABCA1 I/M823 variant with plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in Canadian Inuit and found that M823/M823 homozygotes had significantly higher plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> compared with subjects with the other genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results provide proof of principle of the effectiveness of this approach to identify both rare and common ABCA1 genomic variants and also suggest that common amino acid variation in ABCA1 is a determinant of plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> in the general population </plain></SENT>
