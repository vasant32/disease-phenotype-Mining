<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ABCA subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters includes eleven members to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a new, unusually large gene on chromosome 7p12.3, ABCA13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This gene spans over 450 kb and is split into 62 exons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predicted ABCA13 protein consists of 5,058 ami- no acid residues making it the largest ABC protein described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like the other ABCA subfamily members, ABCA13 contains a hydrophobic, predicted transmembrane segment at the N-terminus, followed by a large hydrophilic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the case of ABCA13, the hydrophilic region is unexpectedly large, more than 3,500 amino acids, encoded by 30 exons, two of which are 4.8 and 1.7 kb in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These two large exons are adjacent to each other and are conserved in the mouse Abca13 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue profiling of the major transcript reveals the highest expression in human trachea, testis, and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of the gene was also determined in 60 tumor cell lines and the highest expression was detected in the SR <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, SNB-19 CNS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>-145 <z:mp ids='MP_0010357'>prostate tumor</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ABCA13 has high similarity with other ABCA subfamily genes which are associated with human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e>: ABCA1 with the cholesterol transport disorders <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, and ABCA4 with several <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ABCA13 gene maps to chromosome 7p12.3, a region that contains an inherited disorder affecting the pancreas (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e>) as well as a locus involved in T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> (INM7), and therefore is a positional candidate for these pathologies </plain></SENT>
