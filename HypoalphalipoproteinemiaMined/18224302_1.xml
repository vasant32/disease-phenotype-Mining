<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This situation leads to a moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> associated with a dysregulation in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the potential beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment in these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> administration, plasma parameters; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> A-I, A-II and A-IV; <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile; and blood pressure were assessed, Western blotting was performed in the aorta of these mice to measure endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and caveolin-1 content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> level present in the double heterozygous group was corrected down to that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> group after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment (124+/-7.7 vs. 109+/-11.2 mmHg, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with this effect, an increase in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels was observed in these double heterozygous mice receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment probably mediated in part by a decrease in caveolin-1 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure changes appeared to be independent of the arylesterase activity of paraoxonase or the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another remarkable result was the significant increase in apoA-IV content in animals receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi>, an effect considered to be protective for the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> can improve blood pressure control in mice with elevated homocysteinemia and low levels of apoA-I, and this effect is mediated by mechanisms independent of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and related to nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
