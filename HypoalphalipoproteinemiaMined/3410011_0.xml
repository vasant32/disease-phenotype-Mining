<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband's erythrocytes had markedly decreased osmotic fragility with target cells observed in the peripheral film </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of his EM <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> content but a marked increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> with concomitant decreases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16038">phosphatidylethanolamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the EM enzymes examined, acetylcholinesterase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activities were decreased while those of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>-K+ ATPase, catalase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed changes in a number of structural and functional properties of erythrocytes in this disorder are indistinguishable from those previously described in homozygotes for familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that in both of these disorders an abnormality of plasma LCAT activity causes, either directly or indirectly, functional and structural changes in the erythrocyte membrane </plain></SENT>
