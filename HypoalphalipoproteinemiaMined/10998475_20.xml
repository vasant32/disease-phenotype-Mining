<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">High density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) are complex <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> particles involved in reverse cholesterol (C) transport and are negatively associated with the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have described a disorder of familial <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency (FHD) due to abnormal cellular cholesterol efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated cellular cholesterol efflux on skin fibroblast from 15 probands with moderate to severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, including one subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> (TD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed family studies on eight of these probands (269 individuals) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> (defined as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> &lt;5th%, and with no known cause of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that four of our FHD patients and patients with TD have mutations at the ABC1 gene, demonstrating that FHD is a heterozygous form of TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On each subject, we carried out detailed biochemical analysis and determined apoA-I-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux using 3H-cholesterol labeled skin fibroblasts from study subjects compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TD has also been associated with abnormal cellular cholesterol efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell fusion experiments with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>) were carried out with fibroblasts from a subject with TD and one with FHD in order to determine whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier</z:e> cells can complement the FHD defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects with a reduced cellular cholesterol efflux, exons of the ABCA1 gene were sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Familial forms of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency, defined as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels &lt;5th percentile, are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A reduced cellular cholesterol efflux has been identified in eight subjects from seven kindred (7/14 or 50% of probands tested), being reduced by a mean 59% of controls (range 49-63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four of these subjects, a mutation at the ABCA1 gene locus was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three other subjects an efflux defect was idenfified but no critical mutation at the ABCA1 gene locus has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the remaining subjects, (7/14), no efflux defect was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complementation studies reveal that the FHD defect is not corrected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier</z:e> cells, confirming that FHD and TD represent a spectrum of the same genetic defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">Familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> syndromes are phenotypically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>; one form is associated with abnormal cellular cholesterol efflux caused by heterozygous mutations at the ABCA1 gene, that defines familial <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> Deficiency while homozygous mutations or compound heterozygocity causes TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Other forms are primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> of unknown cause, while the remaining cases are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> with or without elevated apoB levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a cellular cholesterol defect is a relatively frequent cause of familial <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency and that a mutation at the ABCA1 gene can be identified in half of these patients </plain></SENT>
