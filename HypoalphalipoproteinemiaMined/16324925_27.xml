<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is not clear how much the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> and/or treatment contribute to the changes in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> of HIV-positive males were assessed in a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following groups of patients were studied: (1) untreated for at least 6 months; (2) treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitor</z:chebi> (PI); (3) treatment with a HAART regimen that includes a PI (HAART/PI); (4) treatment with HAART that includes low-dose ritonavir and a PI (HAART/PI/boost) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were compared with those of age-matched HIV-negative healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) levels were 22%, 11%, 14%, and 11% lower for currently untreated HIV, HAART, HAART/PI, and HAART/PI/boost groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Negative correlations were found among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level, peak and current <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load, and duration of the disease and the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and current and nadir CD4 cell count and CD4 percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When patients were divided into subgroups based on duration of antiretroviral therapy, patients treated with HAART and HAART/PI for 3 to 6 years were significantly less likely to have high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels compared with the control group and patients treated for 1 to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 5-fold decrease in the proportion of subjects with high <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and a 3-fold increase in those with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> were found in the group treated with HAART/PI/boost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> in patients with HIV is likely to be secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
