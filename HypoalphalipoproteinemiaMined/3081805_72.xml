<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified a PstI restriction-endonuclease site flanking the human <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I gene at its 3' end that is polymorphic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absence and presence of this site, as determined by genomic blotting analysis of PstI-digested chromosomal DNA with the use of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I gene probe, were associated with 3.3-kb and 2.2-kb hybridization bands, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3.3-kb band appeared in 4.1 percent of 123 randomly selected control subjects and in 3.3 percent of 30 subjects with no angiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, among 88 patients who had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> before the age of 60, as documented by angiography, the 3.3-kb band occurred in 32 percent (P less than 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also found in 8 of 12 index cases (P less than 0.0001) of kindreds with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the two patient groups, the allele frequencies of the site that produced the 3.3-kb band were 17 and 42 percent, respectively, as compared with an allele frequency of only 2 percent in the control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within kindreds with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> and among first-degree relatives of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, the 3.3-kb band was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>decreased HDL cholesterol</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 58 percent had <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels below the 10th percentile of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values; however, this frequency increased to 73 percent when patients with the 3.3-kb band were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the polymorphism in the region between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> C-III genes may be a useful marker for the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
