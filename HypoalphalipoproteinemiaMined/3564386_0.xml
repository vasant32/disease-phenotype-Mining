<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Swelling, separation, disappearance of elasticity and tinctorial properties of elastic fibers of tunica media vasorum and internal elastic membrane were observed in the animals given the above rations during 1-6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the coronary and intrarenal arteries these changes were attended by vacuolization and destruction of the medial smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vascular alterations were most early and drastically manifest in the animals that received the ration with 5% protein and 50% butter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No vascular changes were noted in the animals given sunflower oil in similar amounts and during the same period as butter, with 18% protein in the ration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such action of sunflower oil was not pronounced when the ration contained 5% protein, large amount of cholesterol (1% of the ration mass) or trans-isomers of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
