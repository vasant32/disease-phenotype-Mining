<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) has been identified using MspI restriction endonuclease in the 3' region of the apo A-II gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rare variant site for this MspI (M2) has been reported to be associated with higher levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and apo A-II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the frequency and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> associations of this RFLP in a population of 168 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) male and female patients, who had more than 50% narrowing of one or more arteries prior to age 60 years, as well as 255 aged-matched males and females from the Framingham Offspring Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also studied 31 kindreds in which the proband had premature CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the M2 allele was higher in CAD cases (0.20) than in the controls (0.13) (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In general, those subjects carrying the M2 allele had lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and apo A-I plasma levels; however, this difference was only significant (P less than 0.02 and 0.002, respectively) in females with CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cosegregation of the M2 allele with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> was found in 31 kindreds studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in both generations there was a trend for those subjects carrying the M2 allele to have lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels than those carrying the M1 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the apo A-II gene of subjects homozygous for either the M1 (n = 1) or the M2 allele (n = 2) revealed that this RFLP is due to a T----C single base mutation 528 bp 3' to the apo A-II gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the subjects homozygous for the M2 allele no other mutations were found within the coding region of the apo A-II gene that could result in changes in the primary sequence of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the MspI RFLP 3' to the apo A-II gene is somewhat more frequent in the CAD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant association between this RFLP and any of the parameters examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this DNA marker lacks the specificity to be clinically useful for CAD risk assessment in the population studied </plain></SENT>
