<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of genomic DNA has detected a polymorphism for the PstI restriction endonuclease near the apoA-I gene, with either a 2.2 or a 3.3 kb fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The latter has been previously found to occur with significantly higher frequency in probands of families with familial hypoalpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I was isolated from three unrelated subjects with familial hypoalpha and the 3.3 kb PstI polymorphism of the apoA-I gene, and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The apoA-I from the hypoalpha subjects was structurally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> as determined by amino acid analysis and by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> apoA-I and hypoalpha apoA-I were simultaneously injected into either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls or hypoalpha subjects, both forms of apoA-I were catabolized at the same rate in the same subject, indicating that the hypoalpha apoA-I is also metabolically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the kinetics of metabolism of apoA-I in the hypoalpha subjects, compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, revealed that the reduced plasma levels of apoA-I were due to an increased apoA-I fractional catabolic rate, and that the synthetic rate was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, we conclude that the apoA-I gene in these hypoalpha subjects is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the PstI polymorphism near the apoA-I gene, which is associated with familial hypoalpha, is likely to be a marker for a mutant gene closely linked to, but not in, the apoA-I gene </plain></SENT>
