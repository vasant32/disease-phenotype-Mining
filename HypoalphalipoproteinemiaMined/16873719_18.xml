<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, wide variations in clinical <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phenotypes are observed in patients with mutations in ABCA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the various <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> phenotypes would be the direct result of discrete and differing effects of the mutations on ABCA1 function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether there is a correlation between the mutations and the resulting phenotypes, we generated in vitro 15 missense mutations that have been described in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HDLDT1">Tangier disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
