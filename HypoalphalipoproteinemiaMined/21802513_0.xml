<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to perform further studies with this protein we have optimized an expression and purification method of recombinant <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apo A-I and apo A-I Z and produced mimetic <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles with each protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An pET-45 expression system was used to produce N-terminal His-tagged apo A-I, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> or mutant, in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) which was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography in non-denaturing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles were generated via a modified <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26711">sodium cholate</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression and purification of both proteins was verified by <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, MALDI-TOF MS and immunochemical procedures </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reconstituted <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles checked via non-denaturing PAGE showed high homogeneity in their size when reconstituted both with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apo A-I and apo A-I Z </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An optimized system for the expression and purification of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apo A-I and apo A-I Z with high yield and purity grade has been achieved, in addition to their use in reconstituted <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles, as a basis for further studies </plain></SENT>
