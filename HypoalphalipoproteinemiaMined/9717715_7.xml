<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reductions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and apoA-I are the consequence of the combined metabolic defects of increased apoA-I catabolism and decreased apoA-I synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that overexpression of human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (hLCAT), a pivotal enzyme involved in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism, in LDLr defective rabbits would increase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and apoA-I concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups of hLCAT transgenic rabbits were established: 1) hLCAT+/LDLr heterozygotes (LDLr+/-) and 2) hLCAT+/LDLr homozygotes (LDLr-/-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data for hLCAT+ rabbits were compared to those of nontransgenic (hLCAT-) rabbits of the same LDLr status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In LDLr+/- rabbits, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and apoA-I concentrations (mg/dl), respectively, were significantly greater in hLCAT+ (62 +/- 8, 59 +/- 4) relative to hLCAT- rabbits (21 +/- 1, 26 +/- 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was, likewise, the case when hLCAT+/ LDLr-/- (27 +/- 2, 19 +/- 6) and hLCAT-/LDLr-/- (5 +/- 1, 6 +/- 2) rabbits were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the fractional catabolic rate (FCR, d(-1)) of apoA-I was substantially delayed in hLCAT+ (0.376 +/- 0.025) versus hLCAT- (0.588) LDLr+/- rabbits, as well as in hLCAT+ (0.666 +/- 0.033) versus hLCAT- (1.194 +/- 0.138) LDLr-/- rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I production rate (PR, mg x kg x d(-1)) was greater in both hLCAT+/LDLr+/- (10 +/- 2 vs. 6) and hLCAT+/LDLr-/- (9 +/- 1 vs. 4 +/- 1) rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significant correlations (P &lt; 0.02) were observed between plasma LCAT activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> (r = 0.857), apoA-I FCR (r = -0.774), and apoA-I PR (r = 0.771), while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> correlated with both apoA-I FCR (-0.812) and PR (0.751) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, these data indicate that hLCAT overexpression in LDLr defective rabbits increases <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and apoA-I concentrations by both decreasing apoA-I catabolism and increasing apoA-I synthesis, thus correcting the metabolic defects responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> observed in LDLr deficiency </plain></SENT>
