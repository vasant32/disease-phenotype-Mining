<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In hypertriglyceridemic patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> is commonly believed to be linked to the derangement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study the occurrence of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> has been investigated in a cohort of hypertriglyceridemic patients whose plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration had been normalized either through diet or diet plus drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the initial visit, 115 hypertriglyceridemic patients received dietary advice and returned for the second visit four months later </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> increased in 76 patients whereas in the others, it remained unchanged or even decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration was normalized (less than 200 mg/dl) in 54 patients by diet alone, but among these 11 remained hypoalphalipoproteinemics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in whom, despite dietary restrictions, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> exceeded 200 mg/dl, were considered for pharmacological treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47612">Bezafibrate</z:chebi> (300 mg t.i.d.) for 4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine concluded the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment significantly decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subjects </plain></SENT>
