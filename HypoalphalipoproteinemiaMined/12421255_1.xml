<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> found in adults are non-familial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in children, especially young children, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemias</z:e> other than familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (FH) have not yet been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From April 1990 to March 1999, 56 181 children were screened, and 1380 showed abnormal levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (more than 2.5 standard deviations above the mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among these, 1198 were re-examined and further characterized by measuring <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, and by their familial histories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of the children (928 of 1198) recalled were diagnosed as being dyslipidemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-one children were FH, 423 were type IIa, 128 were type IIb, 98 were type IV, and 188 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presumed incidence of FH was 0.19%, IIa 0.87%, IIb 0.26%, IV 0.20%, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> 0.39%, taking into account the percentage of subjects who refused recall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At regular follow-ups, in many children with type IIb, the phenotypic expression changes from type IIb to IIa or IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> levels were determined in 77 family members in 34 families of children with type IIb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-five family members were dyslipidemic (type IIa 18, type IIb 11, type IV 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, 27 children (79%) with type IIb met the criteria for familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> had more family or genetic background than adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, children with type IIb were mostly familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0008356'>combined hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, setting appropriate eating patterns during childhood might be important for normalizing risk factors for atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, especially in children with FH or type IIb </plain></SENT>
