<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the staggerer mice display lowered plasma apoA-I/-II, decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypo-alpha-lipoproteinemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, relatively little is known about RORalpha in the context of target tissues, target genes, and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, RORalpha is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, a major mass peripheral tissue that accounts for approximately 40% of total body weight and 50% of energy expenditure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This lean tissue is a primary site of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal and fatty acid oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consequently, muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the blood-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the role of RORalpha in skeletal muscle metabolism has not been investigated, and the contribution of skeletal muscle to the ROR-/- phenotype has not been resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We utilize ectopic dominant negative RORalpha expression in skeletal muscle cells to understand the regulatory role of RORs in this major mass peripheral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous dominant negative RORalpha expression in skeletal muscle cells represses the endogenous levels of RORalpha and -gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> and ROR-dependent gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed attenuated expression of many genes involved in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we show that the muscle <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16347,3424">carnitine</z:chebi> palmitoyltransferase-1 and caveolin-3 promoters are directly regulated by ROR and coactivated by p300 and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="26336">PGC</z:chebi>-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study implicates RORs in the control of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> homeostasis in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we speculate that ROR <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> would increase fatty acid catabolism in muscle and suggest selective activators of ROR may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
