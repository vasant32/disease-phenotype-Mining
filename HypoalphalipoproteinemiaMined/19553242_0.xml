<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Severe <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) deficiency is attributed to mutations in several genes and may contribute to the genetic basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify the cellular basis of a novel <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-deficiency phenotype, we screened 54 subjects of French Canadian ancestry with severe <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We excluded individuals with mutations in genes currently associated with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (ABCA1, LCAT, APOA-I, and SMPD1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified two patients in which cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux in the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> biosynthesis process is impaired, whereas cholesterol efflux is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis further showed that the two patients with impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux were defective primarily in the larger alpha-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fibroblasts from affected subjects, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterol</z:chebi> stimulation resulted in increased ABCA1 protein expression and normalized their defective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate for the first time in humans that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and cholesterol efflux are two separate and distinct processes in cellular <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They further show for the first time that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux is necessary for the formation of larger alpha-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The defect in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> efflux is due to defective ABCA1 protein regulation and can be corrected by treatment with physiological <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53030">oxysterols</z:chebi>, a current therapeutic target of interest, that may, with further studies, be used to raise <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels in patients with severe <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiencies </plain></SENT>
