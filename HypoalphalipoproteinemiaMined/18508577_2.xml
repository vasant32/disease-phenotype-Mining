<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the influence of the genetic background into this specific phenotype, four groups of male mice were established: control and double heterozygous groups in C57BL/6J and in C57BL/6J x 129 backgrounds, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels, systolic blood pressure, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, arylesterase activity and aorta histology were analyzed as well as oligonucleotide array hybridization of liver <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results demonstrated that double heterozygous mice in C57BL/6J substrate had a milder phenotype showing lower increase in blood pressure compared to double heterozygous group in hybrid background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of the phenotype in the latter group was associated with lower nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and arylesterase activity levels, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of the vascular media layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hepatic profiling of both genetic substrates showed profound differences in expression of contractile proteins that could explain these pathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, the phenotypic presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with multiple processes from vascular bedside to liver as evidenced by nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> production or paraoxonase levels </plain></SENT>
