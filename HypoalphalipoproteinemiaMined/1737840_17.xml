<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have elucidated the genetic defect in a 66-yr-old patient with fish eye syndrome (FES) presenting with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0007759'>corneal opacities</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient's plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) cholesterol was reduced at 7.7 mg/dl (35.1-65.3 mg/dl in controls) and the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> content was 31% (60-80% in controls); however, total plasma cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">esters</z:chebi> were similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (60% of total cholesterol vs. a mean of 66% in controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's plasma cholesterol esterification rate was slightly reduced at 51 nmol/ml per h (control subjects: 61-106 nmol/ml per h), whereas lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, assayed using a <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>-like exogenous proteoliposome substrate, was virtually absent (0.9 nmol/ml per h vs. 25.1-27.9 nmol/ml per h in control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence analysis of the proband's LCAT gene revealed two separate C to T transitions resulting in the substitution of Thr123 with Ile and Thr347 with Met </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation at codon 347 created a new restriction site for the enzyme Nla III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the patient's polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA containing the region of the Thr347 mutation by digestion with Nla III confirmed that the proband is a compound heterozygote for both defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's daughter, who is asymptomatic despite a 50% reduction of LCAT activity, is heterozygous for the Thr123<z:chebi fb="84" ids="32607">----Ile</z:chebi> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the regions adjacent to Thr123 and Thr347 of LCAT may play an important role in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> esterification, suggesting that these regions may contain a portion of the LCAT binding domain(s) for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
