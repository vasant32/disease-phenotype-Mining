<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a large Spanish kindred, living in the Mediterranean Island of Mallorca, that presents a dominant form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile of this family was studied because the proband, a 40-year-old male presenting signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, showed severe <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, none of the other family members had a known history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the apoA-I gene in affected members identified a 33-base pair deletion, corresponding to residues 165-175 of the mature protein, eliminating the first 11 amino acids of the internal repeat 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I(MALLORCA) is associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> deficiency (concentration ranging from 8-48% of the value in non-carriers), and a 2- to 3-fold decrease in plasma concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II and endogenous LCAT activity, concomitant with a slight decrease in serum cholesterol efflux capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impairment of LCAT activity in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particles containing only mutated forms of apoA-I would not explain a pattern of dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that amino acids 165-175 of apoA-I are critical for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism, at least in part because of their role in LCAT activation </plain></SENT>
