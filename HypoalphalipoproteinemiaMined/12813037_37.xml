<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the rate-limiting step in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) particle formation, is also regulated by cell cholesterol content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the Niemann-Pick C1 protein alters the expression and activity of ABCA1, we determined the ability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (apoA-I) to deplete pools of cellular cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in human fibroblasts derived from NPC1+/+, NPC1+/-, and NPC1-/- subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Efflux of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>-derived, non-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, plasma membrane, and newly synthesized pools of cell cholesterol by apoA-I was diminished in NPC1-/- cells, as was efflux of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17636">sphingomyelin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NPC1+/- cells showed intermediate levels of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> efflux compared with NPC1+/+ and NPC1-/- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding of apoA-I to cholesterol-loaded and non-cholesterol-loaded cells was highest for NPC1+/- cells, with NPC1+/+ and NPC1-/- cells showing similar levels of binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABCA1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels increased in response to cholesterol loading in NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- cells but showed low levels at base line and in response to cholesterol loading in NPC1-/- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with impaired ABCA1-dependent <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> mobilization to apoA-I for <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> particle formation, we demonstrate for the first time decreased plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> levels in 17 of 21 (81%) NPC1-/- subjects studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the cholesterol trafficking defect in NPC disease results in reduced activity of ABCA1, which we suggest is responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003233'>low HDL-cholesterol</z:hpo> in the majority of NPC subjects and partially responsible for the overaccumulation of cellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in this disorder </plain></SENT>
