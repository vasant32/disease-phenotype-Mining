<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have identified a large kindred with severe serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband, a 65-year-old woman, had greatly diminished concentrations of serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.19 mmol/L) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (apo) A-I (21.9 mg/dL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and apo A-I levels were similarly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected family members, while apo A-II levels were about half of those in the nonaffected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis suggested a dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern of the phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis of the exons and exon-intron boundaries of the apo A-I gene revealed heterozygosity for a single T-to-G point mutation substituting arginine for leucine at residue 159 of the mature apo A-I protein (apo A-IFin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T-to-G substitution destroys an Fsp I cleavage site, permitting direct polymerase chain reaction/restriction enzyme analysis of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the affected family members were shown to be heterozygous for the apo A-IFin mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing revealed the presence of the mutant apo A-IFin protein in both serum and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> of the affected subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional consequences of the mutation were examined by expressing the mutated and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apo A-I cDNAs in COS-7 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutant apo A-I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> had a size similar to that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and both mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apo A-I proteins were secreted into the cell media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In vivo kinetic studies of apo A-I revealed increased catabolism in affected subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we describe a novel point mutation of the apo A-I gene, apo A-IFin, causing a dominantly negative phenotype as regards serum <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> levels, possibly due to increased catabolism of apo A-I </plain></SENT>
