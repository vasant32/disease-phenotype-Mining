<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We showed earlier that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I Leu159--&gt;Arg mutation (apoA-IFin) results in dominantly inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated the effect of the apoA-IFin mutation on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> profile, apoA-I kinetics, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activation, and cholesterol efflux in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carriers (n = 9) of the apoA-IFin mutation exhibited several <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level was diminished to 20% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> showed disappearance of particles at the 9.0- to 12-nm size range (HDL2-type) and the presence of small 7.8- to 8.9-nm (mostly HDL3-type) particles only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HDL3-type particles from both the mutation carriers and nonaffected family members were similarly converted to large, HDL2-type particles by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> transfer protein in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies on apoA-I kinetics in four affected subjects favored accelerated catabolism of apoA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments with reconstituted proteoliposomes showed that the capacity of apoA-IFin protein to activate LCAT was reduced to 40% of that of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apoA-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The impact of the apoA-IFin protein on cholesterol efflux was examined in vitro using [3H]cholesterol-loaded human fibroblasts and three different cholesterol acceptors: (1) total <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, (2) total apoA-I combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi>, and (3) apoA-I isoform (apoA-IFin or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> apoA-I isoform 1) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ApoA-IFin did not impair <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> binding or cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts to any of the acceptors used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only one of the nine apoA-IFin carriers appears to have evidence of clinically manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the apoA-IFin mutation does not alter the properties of apoA-I involved in promotion of cholesterol efflux, its ability to activate LCAT in vitro is defective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In vivo, apoA-IFin was found to be associated with several <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> composition rearrangements and increased catabolism of apoA-I </plain></SENT>
