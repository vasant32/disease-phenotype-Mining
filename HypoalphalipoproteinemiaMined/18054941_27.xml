<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Parameters of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism in HIV-positive patients were investigated in a cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following groups of subjects were selected: (i) 25 treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients or HIV-infected patients on long therapy break, (ii) 28 HIV-infected patients currently treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi>, and (iii) 33 HIV-negative subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the HIV-negative group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of HIV-infected patients were characterized by significantly elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B levels, mass and activity of lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase and cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> transfer protein (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was lower in treatment-naïve HIV-infected group only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> and prebeta(1)-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HIV-infected groups (p&lt;0.05), while mean levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I (apoA-I) and ability of plasma to promote cholesterol efflux were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a positive correlation between apoA-I and levels of CD4+ cells (r(2)=0.3, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> transfer protein was reduced in the group on antiretroviral therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together these results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">HIV infection</z:e> is associated with modified <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> metabolism re-directing cholesterol to the apoB-containing <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> and likely reducing the functionality of reverse cholesterol transport </plain></SENT>
