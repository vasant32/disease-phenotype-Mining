<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report six subjects with low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, carrying seven ABCA1 mutations, six of which are previously unreported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two mutations (R557X and H160FsX173) were predicted to generate short truncated proteins; two mutations (E284K and Y482C) were located in the first extracellular loop and two (R1901S and Q2196H) in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ABCA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two subjects found to be compound heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations did not have overt clinical manifestations of TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three subjects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005181'>premature coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (pCAD), had a combination of genetic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides being heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations, two of them were also carriers of the R3500Q substitution in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B and the third was a carrier of N291S substitution in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By extending family studies we identified 17 heterozygotes for ABCA1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and Apo A-I values in these subjects were 38.3 and 36.9% lower than in unaffected family members and similar to the values found in heterozygotes for Apo A-I gene mutations which prevent Apo A-I synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This survey underlines the allelic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of ABCA1 mutations and suggests that: (i) TD subjects, if asymptomatic, may be overlooked and (ii) there may be a selection bias in genotyping towards carriers of ABCA1 mutations who have pCAD possibly related to a combination of genetic and environmental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
