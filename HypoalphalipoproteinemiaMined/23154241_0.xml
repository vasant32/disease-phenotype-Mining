<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if ER stress may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> through suppression of apo A-I gene expression, human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019204" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hepatoma</z:e> cell line Hep G2 was treated with ER stress inducers and the changes in apo A-I gene expression were compared to albumin gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN METHODS: HepG2 cells were treated with tunicamycin (TM) and thapsigargin (TG), two potent inducers of ER stress, and apo A-I and albumin protein levels, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels, and promoter activity were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ER stress was measured using the ER stress-responsive alkaline phosphatase assay and by Western blot quantitation of ER stress markers such as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-regulated protein-78 (GRP-78), phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (phospho-JNK), total JNK, phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (phospho eIF2α), and total eIF2α </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>KEY FINDINGS: TM and TG induced ER stress in HepG2 cells and reduced apo A-I and albumin secretion in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular albumin levels increased in cells treated with TM and TG while intracellular apo A-I levels decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Albumin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and albumin gene promoter activity were reduced in proportion to the decrease in albumin secreted while changes in the apo A-I <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels and promoter activity were modest and did not account for the reduction in apo A-I secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that apo A-I secretion is inhibited by ER stress possibly by affecting cellular degradation pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, ER stress does not affect apo A-I secretion by regulating gene expression </plain></SENT>
