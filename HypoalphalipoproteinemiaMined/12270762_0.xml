<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information regarding the extent of plasma <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> lowering when exogenous <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> is used in subjects with monogenic low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) had been receiving exogenous <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> post-orchidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0473527" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e>, which was not responsive to diet or medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify a possible genetic contribution to his biochemical phenotype, we sequenced the LCAT and APOA1 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no sequence abnormalities in LCAT, but we found that he was a heterozygote for a novel APOA1 mutation in codon 107 (AAG-&gt;TGG), which predicted the replacement of lysine by tryptophan (K107W) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial biochemical measurements over 11 years showed that plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> on either intramuscular or oral <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was 0.19 +/- 0.06 mmol/L, while plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> on transdermal <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> was significantly higher at 0.52 +/- 0.18 mmol/L (p = 0.015, unpaired t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the low plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> associated with heterozygosity for mutant APOA1 can become extremely depressed during treatment with oral or intramuscular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings also suggest that transdermal <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> may perturb <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> to a lesser extent than other routes of delivery in such patients </plain></SENT>
