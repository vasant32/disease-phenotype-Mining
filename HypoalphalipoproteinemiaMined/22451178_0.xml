<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: to analyze the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute kidney injury</z:hpo> (AKI) based on urinary neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGALu) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome (ACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: a cross-sectional study was conducted on the ACS patients who were admitted to the Emergency Room in Hasan Sadikin Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urinary samples were obtained at the time of the arrival and considered AKI if the urinary NGAL level 150 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cardiometabolic risk factors were in accord with the IDF criteria for MetS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: there were 60 subjects that consisted of 39 men (65%) and 21 women (35%) and the average of was 58.47 (SD 9.9) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 30 subjects (50%) considered AKI based on NGAL level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two significant CMR risk factors associated with AKI; blood pressure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> (p 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> being the most significant cardiometabolic factor (p=0.037; OR 5.137 (95% CI 1.102-23.95)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of factors was also associated with the incidence of AKI; the more factors existed in a person the greater the incidence of AKI (p=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> were cardiometabolic risk factors associated with AKI in ACS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The more cardiometabolic factors existed in a person the greater the incidence of AKI </plain></SENT>
