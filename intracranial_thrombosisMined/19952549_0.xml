<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This notwithstanding, an unacceptably high proportion of these patients do not receive prompt and appropriate treatment with evidence-based, guideline-recommended, vascular risk-reduction therapies when exposed to conventional care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> patients reveal that treatment guidelines are often not followed or variably applied, thereby impeding improvements in care quality and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A likely contributor to this evidence-practice chasm has been the unavailability to care providers of user-friendly, broadly applicable tools/algorithms that could facilitate ready and uniform implementation of proven therapies.The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> PROTECT (Preventing Recurrence Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic Events</z:hpo> through Coordinated Treatment) program, was designed for inpatient, outpatient, and transitional care settings, and systematically implements evidence-based medication and behavioral secondary prevention measures following the occurrence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROTECT program pathways and tools incorporate early recognition and prompt initiation of evidence-based, guideline-recommended care in eligible patients without contraindications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The program has been associated with significant increases in discharge treatment utilization, as well as better therapy adherence, target biomarker control and enhanced clinical outcomes in the postdischarge setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By utilizing best-care practices, PROTECT aims to help practitioners caring for patients with established cerebrovascular disease, to improve the quality of in-hospital and postdischarge <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
