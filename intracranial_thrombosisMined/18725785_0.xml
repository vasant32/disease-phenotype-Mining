<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such cases, it is important for the pathologist to understand the therapy/procedure that may have played a role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As such, review of medical records and possible consultation with various medical specialists before autopsy can provide valuable information to ensure proper evaluation in any given case.Herein, we describe a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurring as a complication of septoplasty, nasal polypectomy, and intranasal endoscopic ethmoidectomy, which are common surgical procedures performed by otolaryngology/head and neck surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An otherwise healthy 58-year-old woman underwent the elective surgical procedures for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004411'>deviated nasal septum</z:hpo>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0000462'>nasal polyps</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ethmoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, the patient never awoke from general anesthesia, and further evaluation before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> revealed a basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy disclosed basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, a traumatic defect of the right cribiform plate, and associated anterior cerebral artery injury with frontal lobe damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No vascular anomalies were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was attributed to complications related to nasal surgery, and the manner of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was ruled "accident."Following the presentation of this case, the authors discuss these common nasal surgical procedures, including a summary of their known complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors address and review the topic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
