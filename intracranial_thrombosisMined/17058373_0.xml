<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is an uncommon condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its variable, unspecific clinical presentation causes delays in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyze the validity of different neuroimaging techniques, including CT, MRI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and conventional angiography in the diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We review the imaging findings of 12 patients with the final diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients underwent CT as the initial imaging test; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 underwent MRI; 11 underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography; and 4 underwent conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Visualization of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> or filling defects in the affected vessel were considered direct signs of CVT, whereas findings compatible with venous infarction were considered indirect signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 12 CT examinations, 4 showed direct signs, 2 indirect signs, and 6 only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indirect signs of CVT were seen on follow-up CT in three of the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial CT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT failed to show the real extent of the process except in one case in which a cortical vein was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MRI detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the affected territory in 6 cases; the empty delta sign was seen in 2 and signs of venous infarction in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI failed to diagnose CVT in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed direct signs of CVT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, even without intravenous contrast, and the results were similar to those seen at conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More than two locations were affected in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At CT, indirect signs of CVT are seen, although sometimes not immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Direct signs can be so subtle that they can only be interpreted with experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CT does not show the real extent of the process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, given its availability, contrast-enhanced CT should be the primary imaging test, both to rule out other possibilities and to indicate other neuroimaging studies, in this case MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The results obtained when these two techniques are performed simultaneously, even without contrast administration, are sufficient for diagnosis and are comparable to those at conventional angiography, but without the risks entailed and without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
