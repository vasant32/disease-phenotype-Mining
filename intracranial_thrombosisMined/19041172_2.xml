<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a previous in vitro study using a clot preparation with coagulation induced by recalcification failed to reproduce an effect of "diagnostic" transcranial US on thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate this contradiction in an in vitro model with modified clot preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of 1.8-MHz pulsed-wave (PW) ultrasound (US) emitted by a commercial probe on thrombolysis was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whole blood clots from 0.5-mL venous blood samples were insonated for 1 h through a human temporal bone, using 1.8-MHz PW US emitted by a diagnostic device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experiment was performed with or without recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a concentration of 10 microg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis was measured by means of clot <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> after 1 h of insonation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight occurred when US was used in combination with rt-PA, compared with rt-PA alone (78.7% +/- 2.1% versus 70.8% +/- 4.1%, p &lt;or= 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Repetition of the experiment produced identical results (76.9% +/- 2.5%, compared with control, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Even without rt-PA, US was effective (41.0% +/- 1.7% versus 36.7% +/- 3.7%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of this in vitro study support the clinical observation that diagnostic transcranial US, with or without rt-PA, enhances thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
