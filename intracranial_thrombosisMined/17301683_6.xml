<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test whether conditions in perinfarct cortex facilitate plastic changes, we examined experience-dependent plasticity of cortical functional representation of vibrissae in rat brain after focal photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cortical activation was visualized with [C]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To induce plasticity, four rows of whiskers were trimmed on one side of the snout for a month, whereas one row was spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This deprivation was started immediately after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control rats, cortical representation of the spared row whiskers was significantly enlarged compared with undeprived controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rats with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> posterior to the barrel cortex, no plastic change of the spared row representation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, use-dependent plasticity is impaired in the perinfarct cortex </plain></SENT>
