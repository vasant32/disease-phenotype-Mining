<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we now investigated changes in local cerebral blood flow in a photochemical model compared with changes in a thermocoagulated occlusion model, using autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 5 min, and 3, 6 and 24 h after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, local cerebral blood flow was measured by intravenous injection of 4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-14C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> (20 mu Ci) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic core zone, the reduction in blood flow was similar in the two models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, blood flow in the ischemic border zone in the photochemical model decreased transiently in the third hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and then increased again, while the blood flow in a thermocoagulated model continued to decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time courses of brain damage formation in both models were no different up to 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the transient reduction in cerebral blood flow in the third hour following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may contribute to a reperfusion-like phenomenon in a photochemical model </plain></SENT>
