<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the thrombolytic effects of TMB combined with LFUS are still unclear in a 6 h <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> rabbit model, which closely resembles human embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aiming to extend the 3 h therapeutic window limitation of thrombolytic drugs, a 6 h <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> model of common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion was induced in rabbits, and thrombolysis using TMB by intra-arterial (IA) and intravenous (IV) application combined with LFUS was then compared to untargeted microbubbles (UTMB) and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patency score and thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) in IA TMB combined with LFUS (IA TMB/LFUS) were significantly higher compared to the IA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline control with LFUS (IA SC/LFUS) (both P &lt; 0.05) and IA UTMB plus LFUS (IA UTMB/LFUS) (both P &lt; 0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recanalization rate in the IA TMB/LFUS group (66.67%) was significantly higher compared to the IA SC/LFUS group (12.50%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patency score, TIBI and recanalization rate of IA TMB/LFUS were higher than in the IV TMB/LFUS group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups, which was similar to the infarction ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TMB/LFUS is an effective and safe therapy for thrombolysis in a 6 h <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> rabbit model, and the IA TMB/LFUS group was slightly better than the IV TMB/LFUS group </plain></SENT>
