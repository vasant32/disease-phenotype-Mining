<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of endovascular therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion in the middle cerebral or basilar arteries underwent treatment with intra-arterial thrombolysis, followed by assessment of residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If residual stenosis was greater than 70%, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) was performed in the same session; otherwise, patients were anticoagulated, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed several days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization was achieved in five of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient died of massive infarction, because of the failure of recanalization of the M1 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At discharge, modified Rankin scale distribution of the patients was: grade 0, one patient; grade 1, one patient; grade 2, two patients; grade 3, one patient; grade 6, one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retreatment was required via <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> or stenting in two patients in which type C stenosis was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, endovascular therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thrombotic occlusion of an intracranial artery appears to be effective compared to conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, further refinement of the technique is required to prevent various complications, including vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, dissection, perforating <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and restenosis </plain></SENT>
