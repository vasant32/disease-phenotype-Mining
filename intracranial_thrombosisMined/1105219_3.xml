<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo>, absent peripheral pulses), while ten were free from vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> showed significant elevations of plasma viscosity (p less than 0.005), aggregation of red cells measured both at 37 and 20 degrees C (p less than 0.05), fibrinogen (p less than 0.005), serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (p less than 0.01), serum cholesterol (p less than 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p less than 0.02), and a significant reduction in the albumin/fibrinogen ratio (p less than 0.005) when compared with those free of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with no apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> when investigated were found to have distinctly <z:mp ids='MP_0001598'>abnormal blood viscosity</z:mp> factors, and one subsequently developed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> while the other suffered serious damage of the graft within 3 months of viscosity study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were considered together, significant correlations were found between viscosity of artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> or aggregation of red cells and fibrinogen level (both p less than 0.05), and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level (both p less than 0.05); and between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of red cells and the parathyroid hormone level (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
