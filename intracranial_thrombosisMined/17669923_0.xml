<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively he failed the weaning trials because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0010946'>hyperpnea</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was initially considered to represent a typical case of post cardiac surgery brain underperfusion, but as he later developed persistent signs of endocranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, imaging of the brain vessels was carried out revealing obstruction of the left transverse and the frontal half of the oblique sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with anticoagulation and cerebrospinal fluid drainage through a lumbo-peritoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was discharged from the ICU in good condition after 102 days of hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is generally recommended in cases with post cardiac surgery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> computed tomography scan, adding magnetic resonance phlebography to the examination protocol seems rational </plain></SENT>
