<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Basal ganglia infarction is typically caused by the occlusion of deep arteries and the formation of relatively small lesions called lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> was induced by photothrombotic occlusion of the small vessels within the caudate-putamen and subsequently characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=143) were anesthetized, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> dye (20 mg/kg) was intravenously injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left caudoputamen was exposed to cold white light for 5 to 10 minutes via a stereotaxically implanted <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53205">polymethylmethacrylate</z:chebi> optic fiber (0.5-0.75 mm diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological and morphological changes were assessed at various times during the following 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Local cerebral blood flow was measured 90 minutes after photothrombosis by [(14)C]-N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine quantitative autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time course of blood-brain barrier opening and ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> as well as the effects of aspirin and tissue plasminogen activator treatment were also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A virtually round <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with thrombosed parenchymal vessels surrounded by a layer of selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was formed within the caudoputamen; it turned into a cystic cavity (lacune) over 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A central zone of markedly reduced blood flow and surrounding oligemic zone were observed 90 minutes after light exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lesion size was proportional to light exposure, and the severity and duration of neurological deficits paralleled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early blood-brain barrier opening with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> peaked at day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After tissue plasminogen activator treatment, infarction volume and neurological deficits were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a new rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> by photothrombotic occlusion of the microvessels within the caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With this model, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size correlates with the severity and duration of the neuropathology and can be varied by altering light exposure </plain></SENT>
