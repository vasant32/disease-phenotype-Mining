<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and apo-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> level of TCM treated group (142 cases) and control group (100 cases) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were subdivided into three Type-groups according to TCM Syndrome Differentiation: Phlegm-Dampness Stagnation (PDS), Yin Deficiency with Yang <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>Hyperactivity</z:hpo> (YDYH) and Qi Deficiency with Blood Stasis (QDBS) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that the level of TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, apoA1, apoB and apoA1/apoB were significantly different in PDS and QDBS as compared with control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01, respectively), while lipometabolic disorder of PDS was most serious in TCM Syndrome Differentiation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of TG, apoA1/apoB were significantly different in YDYH in comparing with control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the level of TC, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and apoB were insignificantly different than those of control group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that lipometabolic disorder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were correlated with Syndrome Differentiation of TCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> with PDS and QSBS should give removing Phlegm-Dampness, dredging Meridian and removing blood stasis treatment besides routine treatment </plain></SENT>
