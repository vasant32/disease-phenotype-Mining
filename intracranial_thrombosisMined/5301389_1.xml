<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In studies carried out in limited areas of Czechoslovakia, Japan and Sweden it has been possible to determine the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at autopsy in a large series of cases, and the findings relevant to "vascular lesions affecting the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system" (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) have been compared with the national mortality statistics for the same causes and with the clinical findings.It was found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates for vascular lesions affecting the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, taken as a whole, obtained from the autopsy studies were close to the national figures but that the ratio of cerebral haemorrhage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was lower in the autopsy data, indicating that classification into cerebral haemorrhage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> is incorrect in the national figures and that the former is over-diagnosed at the expense of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>.Comparison of the autopsy data with clinical diagnoses in Prague and Malm√∂ showed that only 70% of the cases of fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vascular accidents</z:e> regarded as the principal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by the pathologist were diagnosed before autopsy, and that many cases found by the pathologist but not considered to be the principal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were not suspected clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less than 1% of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> regarded as the principal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by the clinician were not found by the pathologist </plain></SENT>
