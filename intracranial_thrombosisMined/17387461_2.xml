<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Motor learning depends on preliminary knowledge of the trained and other (similar) skills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to investigate the influence of prior skill knowledge on re-learning of a precision reaching skill after a cortical lesion in rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group of animals recovered a previously known skill (skill training, followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and re-learning training, TST, n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group learned the skill for the first time after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ST, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group received prolonged training without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unilateral partial motor cortex lesions were induced photothrombotically after identifying the forelimb representation using epidural stimulation mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In TST animals, re-learning after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was slower than learning before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (post hoc repeated measures ANOVA P = 0.039) and learning in the control group (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>De novo learning after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ST group) was not different from healthy learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings show that skill learning can be performed if the motor cortex is partially lesioned; re-learning of a skill after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is slowed by prior knowledge of the skill </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It remains to be tested in humans whether task novelty positively influences rehabilitation therapy </plain></SENT>
