<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several studies have highlighted the role of inflammatory biomarkers as an early signal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This study examines the potential advantage of using high-sensitivity interleukin-6 as a possible biomarker at the early stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> for identifying patients at a high risk for 12-month mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Inflammatory biomarkers and neurological scores were determined in 250 patients following mild to moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 24 h of hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome data on mortality were collected after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal detection methodology was used to identify subgroups that were at a high risk for 12-month mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve months following the event, 234 of the 250 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Signal detection identified predictors that distinguished individuals likely to die from those with a better recovery prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma interleukin-6 concentration emerged as the optimal predictor, with a cut point of 6.47 pg/ml, chi(2) (l, N=250)=20.5, P&lt;0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interleukin-6 above 6.47 pg/ml during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase predicted subsequent non-survival (P=0.006, odds ratio 8.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the clinical potential of using high-sensitivity interleukin-6 as an early signal for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survival and suggests a clear cut point for patients at a high risk who might benefit from closer clinical surveillance and/or administration of therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
