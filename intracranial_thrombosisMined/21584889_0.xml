<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the sonographic technique for assessment of the fetal optic nerve sheath and to report on three fetuses with intracranial lesions and <z:mp ids='MP_0008529'>enlarged optic nerve</z:mp> sheath diameter (ONSD) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls matched for gestational age (GA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study ONSD was measured sonographically in three fetuses (aged 23, 24 and 35 gestational weeks) with intracranial findings associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> (ICP; dural <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumors</z:e>) as well as 42 healthy controls matched for GA ± 1 week (aged 22-25 and 34-36 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For fetal eye assessment, transabdominal and transvaginal routes and high-resolution transducers were used for optimal visualization depending on fetal position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements were made using an axial view at the level of the orbits, with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fetal face</z:e> positioned towards the transducer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ONSD was measured 1.5 or 2 mm behind the papilla (depending on GA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> fetuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean ± 2 SD ONSD of controls were calculated for each GA and compared with data from the three fetuses with intracranial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 42 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetuses, ONSD increased from 1.2 mm at 23 weeks to 2.6 mm at 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The measurements at 36 weeks correlated well with those observed in newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ONSD measurements of the three cases were above mean + 2 SD of values obtained from healthy controls at the same GA and also exceeded values of fetuses that were 1 week older </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fetal ONSD measurement is feasible using a technique similar to that used in adults and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ONSD enlargement was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three fetuses with intracranial lesions and may be an early tool with which to diagnose increased ICP </plain></SENT>
