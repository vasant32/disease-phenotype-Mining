<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: High plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [Lp(a)] level is closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Lp(a) concentration is determined primarily by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [apo(a)] gene and <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> abundance has been found to vary with apo(a) isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective is to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) promoter activity is related to plasma Lp(a) level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The 5' 1.4 kilobases (kb) promoter region of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) was cloned into plasmid pGL-2 basic that carries luciferase reporter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The promoter activity was assayed in HepG2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence of the promoter was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Few nucleotide changes besides the variations at the five polymorphic sites: -1270 (TTTTA repeat), -868 (T repeat), -772 (A/G variation), +93 (C/T variation) and +121 (A/G variation) were observed in these promoters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) promoter activity differed in subjects with different plasma Lp(a) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sequence variation of <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>(a) promoter region may contribute to the variation of its transcription activity </plain></SENT>
