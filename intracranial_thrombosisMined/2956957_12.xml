<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were given each of the three drugs for one week in a complete cross-over design according to a randomization schedule, followed by a wash-out period with a placebo for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that CS and TP significantly inhibited platelet aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collagen- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inhibited by CS, TP and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Duncan's multiple range test to compare the anti-platelet effects of the three drugs revealed that: CS greater than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and TP greater than <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> in inhibiting <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation and CS greater than TP and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> greater than TP in inhibiting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results may suggest that CS is superior to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and TP in inhibiting platelet aggregation ex vivo </plain></SENT>
