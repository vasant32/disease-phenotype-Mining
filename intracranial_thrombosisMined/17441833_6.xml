<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the safety of aggressive mechanical disruption of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> following full-dose intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 24 patients with an initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scale (NIHSS) score of &gt;or=10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical evaluations were performed at presentation and 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months (using modified Rankin scale) after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These end points were compared to matched historical controls treated with IV rt-PA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 24 patients, mechanical disruption was undertaken in 17 patients with persistent angiographic occlusion using microcatheter exploration (n= 3), angioplasty (n= 5), snare maneuvers (n= 7), and combination of both (n= 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete recanalization was observed in 10 of the 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological improvement at 24 hours (&gt;or=4 point reduction in NIHSS score) was observed in 11 of 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons with matched controls suggest potential equivalence for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (0% vs 12%), asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (18% vs 15%), and early neurological improvement (65% vs 53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study shows that aggressive mechanical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> disruption in large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is safe with acceptable rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and promotes angiographic recanalization </plain></SENT>
