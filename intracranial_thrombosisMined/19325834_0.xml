<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nanoparticles were formulated using poly D,L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53407">polylactic acid</z:chebi> with surface modifying by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53426">polysorbates 80</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="25" ids="15858">bromide</z:chebi>] (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) assays showed that <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> nanoparticles were not toxic to the cultured BMECs.The decoy oligonuceotides (ODNs) loaded within nanoparticles was 6 microg/mg, encapsulation efficacy was (60.5+/-1.5)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was observed by flow cytometry that the cellular uptake of nanoparticles depended on the time of incubation and the concentration of nanoparticles in the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And confocal microscopy demonstrated that nanoparticles localized mostly in the BMECs cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The released decoy oligonuceotides (ODNs) uptaked by BMECs retained their biologic activity and led to reduced level of tissue factor expression as compared to control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings offer a potential therapeutic strategy in the control of TF expression in BMECs in vitro and suggest that <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> nanoparticles may be appropriate as delivery vehicles for decoy strategy in the gene therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
