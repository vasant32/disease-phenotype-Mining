<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> had a 7- to 10-fold higher incidence of ST segment <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, prolonged Q-Tc interval and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, and a 2- to 4-fold higher incidence of T wave inversion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264886" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conduction defects</z:e>, premature ventricular beats and left ventricular hypetrophy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first three days after admission 29 patients had elevation of serum enzymes which may be derived from cardiac muscle, particularly CPK, which was increased 6-fold, compared to 2-fold increases in HBDH, GOT, and LDH </plain></SENT>
