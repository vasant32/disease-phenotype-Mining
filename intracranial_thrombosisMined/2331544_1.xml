<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Follow-up results for 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo>, which were identified by CT scan within two days of head injury and treated conservatively, were classified into two groups: In the first group of seven cases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> disappeared spontaneously within two weeks; in the second group the other six cases revealed clinical signs and CT scan findings which were identical to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> and underwent surgery within three weeks after the head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This group showed low ICP signs, such as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, atrophic brain or subdural fluid collection with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> at the initial CT scan, and most of these cases had only minor head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Common features of the operative findings in this second group, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> developed, included the identification of an external haematoma capsule based on the fibrin layer and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> beneath the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, fluid type haematoma was present under these structures, but no inner membrane of the haematoma could be identified other than the non-transparent white arachnoid membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate the importance of a low ICP in determining whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> progresses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
