<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 33 consecutive patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were initially treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> was given for at least four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral MRI and MRV were done at four months and repeated after 12 months if <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated by the Rankin scale at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome at 12 months was good, with a median modified Rankin scale score of 0 (range 0 to 2); 27 patients (82%) had no residual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After four months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> deep cerebral veins and cavernous sinuses, 94% of superior sagittal sinuses, 80% of straight sinuses, 73% of jugular veins, 58% of transverse sinuses, and 41% of sigmoid sinuses had recanalised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No further recanalisation was observed thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that recanalisation only occurs within the first four months following <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and not thereafter, irrespective of oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
