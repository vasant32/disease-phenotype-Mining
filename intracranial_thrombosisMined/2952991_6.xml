<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 177 patients (137 male, 40 female) with a disease that fulfilled the criteria of complete or incomplete <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease showed 106 thrombotic lesions of a venous trunk in 62 (35%) of these patients, superficial <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was unrelated to race and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The venous lesions were single in 38 cases and multiple in 24 cases, including 4 with more than 4 territories involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial lesions were also present in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesions were located in the sural (n = 63), iliofemoral (n = 14), inferior vena cava (n = 13), superior vena cava (n = 3), axillary (n = 2) and cerebral (n = 13) veins or territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> developed during the first 4 years of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease in one half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It preceded the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016514" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aphthosis</z:e> by 1 to 10 years in 11 cases, was concomitant with it in 15 cases and appeared more than 10 years after the diagnosis in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>Pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> occurred in 11 patients, requiring clipping of the vena cava in 2, but it was never lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 2 of the 5 patients who died had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (Hughes Stovin syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients could be followed up for 12 to 192 months (mean 43) under <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> or antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five vascular recurrences (13%) were observed, 2 of them (1 arterial graft <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>) under anti-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="28384">vitamin K</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (9 men, 4 women) accounted for 27% of the neurological lesions; its prognosis was favourable in the 7 patients successfully treated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> could not be explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Haemostasis studies showed a decrease of fibrinolytic activity compared to a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and an increase in fibrinogen, factor VIII and Willebrand's factor levels; these abnormalities did not seem to be specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0010140'>phlebitis</z:mp> truly is an element of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>çet's disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Until its mechanism is better understood, effective <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy in cases with proven <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and preventive antiplatelet therapy in the other cases seem to be rational measures </plain></SENT>
