<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is well known that recanalization of thrombosed cerebral sinuses occurs early but without marked influence on the long-term outcome and on final venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand the possible microvascular mechanisms behind these clinical observations, we evaluated the sequels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> superior sagittal sinus (SSS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in rats using micro- and nano-CT imaging of the same specimen to provide large volume and high resolution CT image data respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced in 11 animals which were euthanized after 6h (n=4) or 6 weeks (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight sham-operated rats served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After infusion of contrast into the vasculature of the brains, these were isolated and scanned using micro-, nano-, and synchrotron-based micro-CT ((8 μm³), (900 nm)³, and (1.9 μm³) voxel sizes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cross-sectional area of the superior sagittal sinus, microvessels and cortical veins were quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tissue sections were stained against VEGF antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was confirmed using quantitative rtPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> led to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the bridging veins after 6h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks, a network of small vessels surrounding the occluded SSS was present with concurrent return towards the diameter of the draining bridging veins of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This microvascular network connected to cortical veins as demonstrated by nano- and synchrotron-based micro-CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also the volume fraction and number of cortical veins increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry in the region of the microsvascular network demonstrated a strong immunoreactivity against VEGF, confirmed by rtPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sequel of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> SSS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> induced a network of microvessels ("venogenesis") draining the bridging veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Also the volume fraction of cortical veins increased significantly </plain></SENT>
