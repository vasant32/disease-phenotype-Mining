<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The source of the soluble form of SSAO found in the blood serum is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it has been speculated that it is secreted from cells within the vascular wall where high activity of the enzyme is found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altered SSAO activity has been reported in atherosclerotic plaques of the human aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is a manifestation of long-term atherosclerotic disease, and in this study, plasma SSAO activities were estimated in 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>, and compared to two control groups of 45 individuals in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were found between the patient groups and controls regarding plasma SSAO activity, suggesting that changes in the soluble form of SSAO found in the circulation do not play a major role in this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it does not seem likely that the involvement of vascular tissue occurring in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> results in release of the enzyme into the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, further studies on tissue-bound SSAO in cerebral vessels would be of great interest </plain></SENT>
