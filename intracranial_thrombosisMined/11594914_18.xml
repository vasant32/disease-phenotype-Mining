<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with obscure pathophysiologic properties that differ from arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its main mechanisms of pathophysiology are the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the coexistence of cytotoxic and vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot differentiate between vasogenic and cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings and characterize the clinical applications of DWI in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary referral center, neurology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: From November 1998 to March 2001, 14 patients (5 men, 9 women; mean age, 43 +/- 10 years) with CVT underwent DWI, conventional MRI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, or conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal findings on DWI and conventional MRI indicated the necessity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography and conventional angiography to confirm the diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) values were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the abnormal lesions with visual inspection of DWI and T2-weighted echo planar imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Findings on DWI were grouped according to 3 patterns: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> signal intensity (SI) (10 patients) showed mixed bright high SI and low SI and the corresponding <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were inversely correlated to the DWI SI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The areas of prominent low SI on DWI were reversed with adequate treatment on follow-up MRI in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(2) Multifocal high SI (3 patients) was similar to that observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The corresponding <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were decreased and DWI was performed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) Intravascular clot with high SI was found with (1 patient, also in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> SI group) or without (1 patient) parenchymal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, DWI demonstrated T2-negative and fluid attenuated inversion recovery-negative lesions without correlative symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that DWI with <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps can be used to discriminate between types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> for tissue viability and to provide information about stages and diagnostic clues in CVT </plain></SENT>
