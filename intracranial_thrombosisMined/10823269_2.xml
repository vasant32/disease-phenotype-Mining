<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ogiku et al. reported that one such inhibitor, imidapril, significantly prolonged survival in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the effect of imidapril on cerebral blood vessels in SHRSP to clarify role of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> in mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imidapril was administered orally at 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks from the age of 7 weeks, and was shown to prevent the usual increase in blood pressure seen in these animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It also delayed He-Ne laser-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and increased significantly the plasma concentration of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolites (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To confirm the association between nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and these effects of imidapril, an inhibitor of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase, N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) was dissolved in drinking water and administered to the animals for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of six rats died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> was given alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When imidapril (5.0 mg/kg/day) was administered with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, however, the animals showed no signs or symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these instances, therefore, the concurrent administration of L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> with imidapril reversed significantly the effects of imidapril </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravenous injection of imidaprilat (100 microg/kg), an active metabolite of imidapril, also decreased blood pressure significantly and increased the plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3</z:chebi> after 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, imidaprilat enlarged arteriolar diameters and caused an increase in red cell velocity and mean blood flow in pial arterioles after 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results strongly suggested that imidapril protects cerebral vessels in SHRSP by elevating the release of NO, thereby improving the cerebral circulation and reducing the tendency to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
