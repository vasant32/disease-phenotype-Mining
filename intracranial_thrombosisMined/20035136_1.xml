<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old woman suffered rebleeding from a ruptured vertebral artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after endovascular internal trapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was initially successfully occluded with the affected vertebral artery using detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, rebleeding from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurred on the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rebleeding may have resulted from the thrombolytic effect of urokinase, which was injected intrathecally 3 hours before rebleeding occurred, or the relatively loose coil packing of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case indicates the potential risk of intrathecal use of thrombolytic agents and the importance of complete tight coil packing of the whole dissected site in the treatment of ruptured vertebral artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
