<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We present the early experience in thrombolysis in three major centers of Ho Chi Minh city, namely 115 People Hospital, Gia Dinh Hospital, and An Binh Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study of consecutive patients treated with intravenous tPA with a treatment protocol similar to that of the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores on admission and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) scores at 3 months were measured for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial and systemic hemorrhagic complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: A total of 121 of 6171 (2%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS received thrombolysis over 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 57 years (range 18-78) and initial median NIHSS score was 12 (range 5-23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean delay between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and treatment was 143 min (range 50-210) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three (60.3%) patients received the standard dose with the remaining 48 patients (36.9%) treated with a lower dose, a mean calculated dose of 0.62 mg/kg (range, 0.6-0.86 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over half (56.3%) of the patients receiving low dose achieved functional independence (mRS score 0-1) at 3 months compared with 34.2% in the standard-dose group (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-month mortality rate was also higher in the standard-dose group (2.1% vs. 12.5% with standard-dose tPA; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was noted in four patients of standard-dose group and one patient of low-dose group (P = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravenous thrombolysis, particularly in a lower dose, is safe and feasible in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS in our selected Vietnamese population </plain></SENT>
