<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CVT is so difficult to be detected by conventional diagnostic methods that it is sometimes overlooked despite its potential severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 79-year-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> due to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> who suddenly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> during her hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying etiology had been not identified by physical examinations, various laboratory data, and repeated computed tomography, and finally she died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The post-mortem examination showed a massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> impacted in intracranial left-sided transverse and sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that CVT can occur in a nephrotic patient who presents unexplained neurological signs and symptoms, which might not be detected only through conventional diagnostic tests </plain></SENT>
