<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The severity of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is variable in patients, because the occlusion position on the artery and the territory of distal vessels are individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between the extent of initial brain lesion and the subsequent pathophysiological responses is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the effects of the initial brain lesion size on the subsequent pathophysiological responses by using a photochemically induced thrombotic brain damage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e>-BD) model, in which the brain lesion size can be well-reproducibly controlled than that induced by a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e>-BD model, a large lesion, which comprised 4.9% of the whole brain on day 3, showed a 56% reduction until day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a small lesion, which comprised 1.3% of the whole brain, showed a 30% reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, on day 5, the activation of both microglia and astrocytes was lesser in mice with small lesions than in mice with large lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found that, smaller lesions in mice lacking gene of urokinase-receptor (uPAR(-/-)) than <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (uPAR(+/+)) mice on day 3 showed less reduction until day 7 in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O model, whereas lesions with comparable size in uPAR(-/-) mice showed comparable reduction with uPAR(+/+) mice in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e>-BD model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus it was indicated that the less reduction of the lesions in uPAR(-/-) mice in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-O model did not result from the deficient gene but the difference of the initial lesion size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the more severe the brain damage, the stronger the subsequent pathophysiological responses </plain></SENT>
