<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The excretion rate of AT III RA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (CH) was 12.33 +/- 1.61 X 10(-4) ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with CH were further classified into two groups: in group CH-I, whose consciousness state was stupor or further deteriorated including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> on admission, the excretion rate of AT III RA was 18.08 +/- 2.50 X 10(-4) ml/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In group CH-II, whose consciousness state was clear on admission, the excretion rate of AT III RA was significantly lower than that in CH-I (6.20 +/- 1.56 X 10(-4) ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The excretion rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (CT) was 1.96 +/- 0.25 X 10(-4) ml/min, which was significantly lower than that in CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The excretion rate of AT III RA in both CH and CT was significantly higher than that in the healthy control group (0.29 +/- 0.04 X 10(-4) ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, AT III may change dynamically in cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
