<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated plasma levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10, E-selectin, P-selectin, sICAM-1 ,sVCAM-1 vWF, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> and PAI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with cardioembolic subtype showed significantly higher median plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta whereas the lacunar subtype showed significantly lower median plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was noted between the severity of neurological deficit at admission, the diagnostic subtype and some inflammatory variables </plain></SENT>
