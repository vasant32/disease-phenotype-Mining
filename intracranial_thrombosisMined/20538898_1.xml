<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, rtPA aggravates the impairment of cerebrovasodilation induced by global <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; this impairment is attenuated by the preinjury treatment with the plasminogen activator inhibitor derivative EEIIMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAPK (a family of kinases, p38, and JNK) is upregulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined whether the novel plasminogen activator inhibitor-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, Ac-RMAPEEIIMDRPFLYVVR-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>, (PAI-1-DP) given 30 min before or 2 h after, focal central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system injury induced by photothrombosis would preserve responses to cerebrovasodilators and the role of p38 and JNK MAPK in such effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid JNK and p38 levels were elevated by photothrombotic injury, an effect potentiated by rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovasodilation was blunted by photothrombosis and reversed to vasoconstriction by rtPA but restored to dilation by PAI-1-DP pre- and posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PAI-1-DP blocked JNK, but preserved p38 MAPK upregulation after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The JNK MAPK <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SP600125 prevented, and the p38 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SB203580 potentiated, impaired cerebrovasodilation after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that rtPA impairs cerebrovasodilation after injury by activating JNK, while p38 MAPK is protective, and that the novel <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> PAI-1-DP protects by inhibiting activation of JNK by rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>JNK MAPK inhibitors, including PAI-1-DP, may offer a novel approach to increase the benefit-to-risk ratio of thrombolytic therapy and enable its use in central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system ischemic disorders </plain></SENT>
