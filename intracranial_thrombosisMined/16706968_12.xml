<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the evidence for diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by fibrin-related markers is not well-established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cutoff values of D-dimer and SF in the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma concentrations of SF and D-dimer were measured in 784 inpatients suspected of having <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> between 1 August 2003 and 31 December 2004, and then correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Plasma concentrations of D-dimer and SF were significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, compared with those in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When cutoff values of &gt; 3.0 microg mL(-1) for D-dimer and &gt; 6.0 microg mL(-1) for SF were used for the diagnosis, more than 50% of patients (with the exception of liver transplant patients and postoperative patients) had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that SF was more useful than D-dimer for the diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (i.e. DVT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value of D-dimer (7.87 microg mL(-1)) was the same for DVT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi>, while that of SF was slightly lower for DVT (7.05 microg mL(-1)) than for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (8.60 microg mL(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that high levels of plasma fibrin-related markers reflect high risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
