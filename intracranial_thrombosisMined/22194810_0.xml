<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: (19)F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recently introduced as a promising technique for in vivo cell tracking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we compared (19)F MRI with iron-enhanced MRI in mice with photothrombosis (PT) at 7 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PT represents a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vessel occlusion and delayed neuroinflammation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Perfluorocarbons (PFC) or superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> particles (SPIO) were injected intravenously at different time points after photothrombotic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While administration of PFC directly after PT induction led to a strong (19)F signal throughout the entire lesion, two hours delayed application resulted in a rim-like (19)F signal at the outer edge of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings closely resembled the distribution of signal loss on T2-weighted MRI seen after SPIO injection reflecting intravascular accumulation of iron particles trapped in vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> as confirmed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By sequential administration of two chemically shifted PFC compounds 0 and 2 hours after illumination the different spatial distribution of the (19)F markers (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core/rim) could be visualized in the same animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When PFC were applied at day 6 the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="24061,30236">fluorine</z:chebi> marker was only detected after long acquisition times ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SPIO-enhanced MRI showed slight signal loss in vivo which was much more prominent ex vivo indicative for neuroinflammation at this late lesion stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study shows that vessel occlusion can be followed in vivo by (19)F and SPIO-enhanced high-field MRI while in vivo imaging of neuroinflammation remains challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The timing of contrast agent application was the major determinant of the underlying processes depicted by both imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Importantly, sequential application of different PFC compounds allowed depiction of ongoing vessel occlusion from the core to the margin of the ischemic lesions in a single MRI measurement </plain></SENT>
