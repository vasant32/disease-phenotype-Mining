<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two numerical and two structural mosaicisms detected in amniocyte cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first fetus had a 47,XY,+mar[10]/46,XY[10] karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The marker chromosome was shown to be derived from chromosome 15 by FISH method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The newborn had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001511'>intrauterine growth retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and died at the 29th day of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second fetus had a 45,X[4]/46,XX[26] karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parents refused cordocentesis and decided to terminate pregnancy in the 21st week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third case, presented with bilateral large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002190'>choroid plexus cysts</z:hpo>, had a 46,XX, dup(1)(q22-q32)[9]/46,XX[21] karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The parents' karyotypes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the pregnancy was aborted in the 23rd week of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The second structural abnormality was reported as 46,XX,t(6;11)(q23; p13)[3]/46,XX[20] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mosaicism was detected in only one flask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The parents decided to continue pregnancy and cordocentesis could not be performed due to the fetal and placental position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The baby was born at term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocyte culture resulted in a 46,XX <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Information and risks were explained to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families during genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism in prenatal diagnosis needs both detailed examination and follow up, since clinical findings depend on the type of abnormality </plain></SENT>
