<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effects of MM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> on brain capillary endothelial expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and thrombomodulin (TM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultured bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BEC) incubated with MM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (25 microg/ml) for 24 h showed increased PAI-1 mRNA levels by approximately seven-fold, while tPA and TM <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were reduced by 84% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PAI-1 protein levels increased two-fold (16.8+/-7.6 vs. 7.6+/-2.1 ng/ml, p&lt;0.05), whereas tPA protein levels decreased by 45% (1.3+/-0.5 ng/ml vs. 2.3+/-0.7 ng/ml, p&lt;0.05), and TM protein level decreased by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following incubation with MM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, PAI-1 activity was increased 35% (18.4+/-5.0 vs. 24.8+/-5.2 AU/ml, p&lt;0.05), while TM activity was decreased by 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> therefore has substantial pro-thrombotic effects on brain capillary endothelial cells, reducing both endothelial fibrinolytic capacity (downregulating tPA while upregulating PAI-1) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> function (downregulating TM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that MM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> may contribute to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the brain </plain></SENT>
