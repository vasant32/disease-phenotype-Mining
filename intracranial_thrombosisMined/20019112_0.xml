<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mechanical thrombectomy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is of increasing interest as it is a promising strategy for fast and efficient recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several thrombectomy devices have been introduced to the armentarium of mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, new devices are under development and are continuously added to the neurointerventional tool box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each device advocated so far has a different design and mechanical properties in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a systematic evaluation under standardized conditions in vivo of these new devices is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction, and potential complications of the novel Phenox <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> for distal mechanical thrombectomy in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The device was evaluated in an established animal model in the swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization rate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, vasospasm, and complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radiopaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (2 cm length) were used for the visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction during retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Phenox <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> (4 mm diameter) was assessed in 15 vessel occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For every occlusion a maximum of 3 retrieval attempts were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete recanalization (TICI 3/TIMI 3) was achieved in 86.7% of vessel occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 66.7% (10/15), the first retrieval attempt was successful, and in 20% (3/15), the second attempt led to complete recanalization of the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases (13.3%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> retrieval was not successful (TICI 0/TIMI 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 1 case (6.7%) a minor embolic event occurred in a small side branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No distal thromboembolic event was observed during the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e>-device interaction illustrated the entrapment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> by the microfilaments and the proximal cage of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> compression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath>, dissection, or fracture of the device occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small animal study, the Phenox <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> was a safe and effective device for mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The unique design with a combination of microfilaments and proximal cage reduces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> compression with a consequently high recanalization and low complication rate </plain></SENT>
