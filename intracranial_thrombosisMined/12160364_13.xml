<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may develop during pregnancy and sometimes improves spontaneously after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of pregnancy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after immunosuppressive treatment and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> on the outcome of pregnancy have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of pregnancy and the disease course among women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Twelve centers participating in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 36 women who received immunosuppressive therapy to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes of pregnancy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and blood counts before, during, and after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 36 pregnancies resulted in 34 live births (one set of twins), 2 elective abortions, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 36 pregnancies, 22 were uncomplicated and 14 involved medical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven pregnancies (19%) were complicated by relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 5 patients without relapse (14%) needed transfusions during delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After delivery, 3 of the 7 patients who had relapse recovered spontaneously and 3 recovered after retreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient who did not respond to treatment died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> had a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> after delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Women with uneventful pregnancies had better prepregnancy remission status (8 complete and 11 partial remissions) and a higher median platelet count (146 x 10(9) cells/L) than did women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complicated pregnancies</z:e> (2 complete remissions, 8 partial remissions, and 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>; median platelet count, 92 x 10(9) cells/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Successful pregnancy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome is possible in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> previously treated with immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complications appear to be more likely in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
