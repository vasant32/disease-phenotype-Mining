<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to study the role and metabolism of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) subfractions, the serum HDL2-cholesterol (HDL2-C) and HDL3-cholesterol (HDL3-C) were measured by the new method using high performance liquid chromatography in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and patients with various diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was highly characteristic that the serum HDL3-C levels of the patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (LC) were remarkably lower than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The result suggests that HDL3 may be produced in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the serum HDL2-C and HDL3-C levels were significantly lower in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (CHD) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (CT) than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the changes in the serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) levels were mainly due to those in the serum HDL2-C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the patients with atherosclerotic diseases (CHD, or CT) the changes in the serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> levels Were attributed to those of both the serum HDL2-C and HDL3-C levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>So it is suggested that in the atherosclerotic diseases, in which the HCL-C is usually lower, the HDL3-C also may play an important role in the regulation of the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> and its anti-atherogenetic effect </plain></SENT>
