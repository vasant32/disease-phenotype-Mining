<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of thrombotic molecules in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) and cavernous malformations (CMs), and in <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> after radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fresh-frozen surgical specimens from 18 <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> (including three that had previously been treated with radiosurgery), seven CMs, and three control specimens were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of tissue factor, thrombomodulin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) were examined using immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombomodulin and vWF were expressed in the endothelium of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens, while tissue factor was predominately found in the perivascular region and vascular adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> with either radiation or embolisation did not significantly alter the intensity of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some irradiated lesions, vessels were found with absent endothelial vWF staining and exposed tissue factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study has demonstrated that loss of the endothelium and exposure of underlying tissue factor occurs in irradiated <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the expression of these thrombotic molecules in vascular malformations when compared to control vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While no long-term alterations in antigen expression were observed after radiosurgery, further work may elucidate the nature of the immediate response to irradiation </plain></SENT>
