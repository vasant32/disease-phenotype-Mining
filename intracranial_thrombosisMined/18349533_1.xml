<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the rate of major neurologic improvement (MNI) at 24 h following endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and its association with short-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients presenting to our institution over 4 years and undergoing ERT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiograms were independently reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on demographics, medical history, initial NIHSS score, 24-hour NIHSS score, site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vascular lesion, pre- and posttreatment Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> scores, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (within 36 h of intervention that was associated with a 4-point decline in NIHSS score) and discharge disposition were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of MNI (defined as &gt;or=8-point improvement in NIHSS or a score of 0-1 at 24 h) and favorable discharge status (defined as home or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rehabilitation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included (median age = 71 years, 60% women, median NIHSS score = 19.5, anterior circulation = 75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modes of ERT were pharmacologic only (28%), mechanical only (35%) and multimodal therapy (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> 2 or 3 recanalization was achieved in 64.7% (mechanical only 46%, pharmacologic only 63% and multimodal 84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcomes were: symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (11.8%), MNI (26.5%) and favorable discharge (41.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age (OR = 0.93, p = 0.003) and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (OR = 6.0, p = 0.018) were independent predictors of MNI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MNI was a strong predictor of favorable discharge status (OR = 46.4, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, MNI occurred in over one fourth of the patients and independently and strongly predicted favorable discharge outcome </plain></SENT>
