<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship of race to incidence of hospitalization for cerebrovascular disease among 74,096 white and 33,041 black persons who took health examinations in a prepaid health care program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analyses were controlled for age, sex, body mass index, coffee use, smoking, alcohol use, systolic blood pressure, and baseline disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blacks were at higher hospitalization risk than whites for hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 2.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.3-5.8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (relative risk = 1.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.9), and nonspecific cerebrovascular disease (relative risk = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.2-2.2) but at lower hospitalization risk for extracranial occlusive disease (relative risk = 0.4, 95% confidence interval = 0.2-0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure had a similar relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of cerebrovascular disease in both races, but there were disparities in the relations of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors to different types of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Educational attainment had little relation to hospitalization for extracranial occlusive disease, a finding that reduces the likelihood that selection bias explains the racial disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show unexplained racial differences in the type and location of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences are important in understanding the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease and have practical clinical implications </plain></SENT>
