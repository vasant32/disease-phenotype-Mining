<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of Factor VII Coagulant (VIII C), Factor VIII-Related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> Factor (VIII-RWF) and Factor VIII-related Antigen (VIII ARg) were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant rise of VIII RAg was noticed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of patients as compared to the control group: this increase appears to be related to the severity of vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant rise of VIII RWF, parallel to the VIII RAg increase, was also noticed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of patients showed a significant and uniform increase of VIII C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average ratio of VIII RAg/VIII C was raised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, except diabetics without complications; but the increase was statistically significant only in those patients with a heavier vascular injury which is related to the marked rise of VIII RAg in such clinical situations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study are discussed in relation to the literature data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significance of the determination of VIII RAg/VIII C ratio and of the VIII RAg assay as methods for monitoring the severity of the vascular injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are also discussed </plain></SENT>
