<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Our university hospital serves a population of 300 000 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> is the leading cause of admission in our department of neurology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In June 2003, when the Emergency Department (ED) was closed in our institution, was created an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> network (ASN), comprising 2 beds of direct admission and thrombolysis in the intensive care unit, and 4 beds dedicated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care in the department of neurology, in which standardized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care protocols were implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care related to the creation of the ASN in terms of delays of arrival, imaging, use of intravenous (IV) thrombolysis, and outcome of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study during 18 months to evaluate characteristics of patients admitted with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in the newly created ASN and to assess conditions of treatment with IV thrombolysis in terms of safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also compared the outcome data before and after the creation of the ASN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For each patient admitted in our hospital for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, were prospectively collected clinical and outcome data (age, mode of transport, delay of arrival after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (OS), treatment with IV thrombolysis, outcome and discharge) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted in the ED during six months in 2002, and in the ASN during 18 months, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty four patients were admitted in the ASN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Emergency medical services (EMS) were used in half of cases for transport, and median delay of admission after the OS was 2h and 52 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median delay of imaging was 1 h and 45 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (8.5 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>100 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients) were treated with IV thrombolysis, with an initial good outcome in 9 patients, 7 with a dramatic recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The main reason for therapeutic abstention for untreated patients admitted in the first 3 hours was a mild deficit with a NIHSS&lt;6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with the previous management in the ED, patients in the ASN were younger, had more severe neurological symptoms, the EMS transport was the main mode of transport (versus used in 17 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>100 of cases in 2002), and the delay of admission was significantly lower: 2 h 52 versus 5 h 10 (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After adjustment on the main predictive factors, only patients with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> had a better outcome after the creation of the ASN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Creation of an ASN was associated with a significant decrease of admission and imaging delays, due to a strong collaboration with EMS, and with a better outcome for hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Treatment with intravenous thrombolysis in the first 3 hours could be used widely and was efficient and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the creation of dedicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients remains necessary to improve quality of care and outcome </plain></SENT>
