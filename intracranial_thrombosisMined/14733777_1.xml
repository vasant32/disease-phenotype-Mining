<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Coagulation factor VII (FVII) levels in plasma are usually related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> shares many of the risk factors related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>Is there any relationship between factor VII and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between FVII and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and reported genotype frequencies and allelic frequencies of FVII gene polymorphisms in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from Ruijin Hospital, and 149 age-matched patients clinically free of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> to act as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were unrelated, and were from the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FVII coagulant activity (FVIIc) was determined using an clotting assay, activated FVII (FVIIa) and FVII Ag were assayed using enzyme immunoassay kits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FVII gene polymorphisms to be detected included-401G/T, -402G/A, 5'F7A1/A2, IVS7 and R353Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>5'F7 and IVS7 were revealed by means of a PCR and direct <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rest were examined by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results showed that FVIIc, FVIIAg and FVIIa were higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the genotype frequencies of FVII gene polymorphisms between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The allelic frequencies in the Chinese Han population were as follows: -401G/T (96.64/3.36), -402G/A (52.01/47.99), 5'F7A1/A2 (96.64/3.36), IVS7 H5/H6/H7/H8 (0.34/52.35/46.98/0.34) and R353Q (95.64/4.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) in these allelic frequencies between the Chinese Han and European populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that increased plasma FVII levels may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>And there was no significant difference in genotype frequencies of these five FVII gene polymorphisms between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these results showed that the frequencies of protective allele, including -401T, 5'F7 A2 and 353Q were lower, but that -402A, which was previously found to be associated with increased plasma FVII levels, is higher in Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
