<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we superimposed multiparametric MRI (apparent diffusion coefficient, T2, perfusion-weighted, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-enhanced T1-weighted imaging) on tissue sections stained for phagocytes and astrocytes and, moreover, assessed the regional distribution of tissue pH and ATP content by invasive biochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparing the histological data with the various MRI parameters, high-resolution MRI did not allow a spatial discrimination between distinct areas of phagocyte accumulation or astroglial scar formation, based on image contrast or even quantitative parameter value differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, MRI parameters underwent characteristic changes and differentiated distinct stages of tissue remodeling between days 3 and 14 after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and high T2 values indicated an early stage (3 days) with <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and beginning glial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and reduced T2 elevation characterized an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with advanced glial activation and infiltration of hematogenous cells at 7 days after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> together with T2 elevation reflected a late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> stage (14 days) when pseudocystic degeneration and scar formation had occurred </plain></SENT>
