<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> from November 1, 2002, through October 31, 2003, at 3 tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> from 3 tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology centers were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with space-occupying lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients were evaluated with lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The rate of occurrence of CVST in patients with presumed IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding patients with mass lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, the occurrence of CVST was 10 (9.4%) of 106 patients with presumed IIH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients had a diagnosis of suspected CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed in 1 of the 10 patients with MRI alone, whereas it was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients with MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Underlying risk factors for CVST were identified in 9 of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> accounts for 9.4% of patients with presumed IIH in 3 tertiary care neuro-ophthalmology services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography in combination with MRI is recommended to identify this subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
