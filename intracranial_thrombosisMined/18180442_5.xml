<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The TT genotype of a functional factor XII (FXII) C46T gene polymorphism was shown to be a risk factor for peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether this genetic variant also increases the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study including 78 consecutive patients with proven CVT and 201 healthy population controls from South Germany </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FXII C46T genotype was assessed using a PCR technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TT genotype of the FXII C46T polymorphism was more common in patients (16.7%) than in controls (5.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A strong association of the TT genotype with CVT was found, which was independent of covariables (adjusted odds ratio 4.57; 95% CI 1.55 to 13.41; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The TT genotype of the functional factor XII C46T gene polymorphism may be a new independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our finding warrants confirmation in an independent study before this genetic variant should be added to the panel of established risk factors for CVT </plain></SENT>
