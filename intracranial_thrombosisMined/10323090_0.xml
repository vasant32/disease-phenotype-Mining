<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective has been to know the prevalence of these two mutations in a group of patients with thrombophilic pathology and to compare it with its prevalence in a control group of Spanish population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 64 patients were divided in two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT): 24 with an unique episode of DVT; 11 with more than one episode; 3 with DVT and pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, and one with DVT and more than one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, 25 patients with other pathologies, such as pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (9 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (10 patients) and 6 who came to our Department because there were some carrier in their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 20210A allele was analyzed in 37 of the 64 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some of the 64 patients had haematological determinations of the activated protein C resistance (APC resistance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As well, 103 unrelated subjects with unknown thrombotic pathologies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We have found a prevalence of factor V Leiden in the group of patients of 14.1% (9 carriers in 64 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them in the first group of 39 patients with DVT) versus 1% in the control group (1 carrier in 103 controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the difference between the prevalence of the 20210A allele was not statistically significant between the group of patients and the control group (2.7% vs 2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 75% of the patients no haematological results of APC resistance were obtained, generally because they were with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment, and in 11.1% of the carriers the result of the determination was considered as ambiguous or false negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Factor V Leiden is well established as risk factor in the thrombophilic pathology, but more studies are needed to know the meaning of the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene </plain></SENT>
