<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first was to determine whether a combination of measurements of subarachnoid clot volume, clearance rate, and density could improve prediction of which patients experience vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second was to determine if each of these three measures could be used independently to predict vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Digital files of the cranial computerized tomography (CT) scans obtained in 75 consecutive patients admitted within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) were analyzed in a blinded fashion by an observer who used quantitative imaging software to measure the volume of SAH and its density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clot clearance rates were measured by quantifying SAH volume on subsequent CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm was defined as new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a focal neurological deficit or altered consciousness 5 to 12 days after SAH in the absence of other causes of deterioration, diagnosed with the aid of or exclusively by confirmatory transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and/or cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that vasospasm was significantly associated with the SAH grade as classified on the Fisher scale, the initial clot volume, initial clot density, and percentage of clot cleared per day (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, initial clot volume and percentage of clot cleared per day were significant predictors of vasospasm (p &lt; 0.05), whereas Fisher grade and initial clot density were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative analysis of subarachnoid clot shows that vasospasm is best predicted by initial subarachnoid clot volume and the percentage of clot cleared per day </plain></SENT>
