<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We encountered a 43-year-old female who was hospitalized for investigation and treatment because of intermittent <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsive</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right brain cortical vein <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; therefore, a 3 mg dose of WF was empirically initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prothrombin time (PT), expressed as the international normalized ratio (INR), did not change at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, even when WF was increased to a dose of 11 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct sequence analysis revealed *3 in CYP2C9 and 3673 GA, 6484 CT, 6853 GC and 9041 GA in VKORC1, indicating that the genotypic pattern of the two genes is the responsible SNP for the moderate phenotype on WF sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusively, our case may present an unknown mechanism other than the concern mentioned above </plain></SENT>
