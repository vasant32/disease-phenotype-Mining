<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these patients, presence of vessel occlusion is an important factor governing treatment decisions and possible endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to assess the value and diagnostic accuracy of angiographic thin-slice volume perfusion CT reconstructions for the detection of intracranial large vessel occlusion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> received nonenhanced CT, CTA, and volume perfusion CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> images were obtained on a 128-slice multidetector CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT angiographic axial and coronal maximum-intensity projections of the head were reconstructed from conventional CTA and from the peak arterial scan of the volume perfusion CT data set (4-dimensional CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Images were assessed for the presence of intracranial vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of ischemic lesions was analyzed on perfusion parameter maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On CTA, 30 patients (52%) had a total of 33 occluded intracranial artery segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight occlusions were identified on 4-dimensional CTA, resulting in an 85% sensitivity with a positive predictive value of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When combined with an analysis of the perfusion parameter maps, sensitivity of 4-dimensional CTA increased to 94% with a positive predictive value of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, angiographic volume perfusion CT reconstructions may be a feasible option to detect intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and evaluate patients for endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity for detection of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> can be increased by simultaneous assessment of perfusion parameter maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Future studies should assess whether time-resolved 4-dimensional CTA may offer additional diagnostically relevant information compared with single-phase CTA </plain></SENT>
