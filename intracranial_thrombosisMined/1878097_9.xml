<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 children with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>cortical blindness</z:hpo> remained blind on subsequent examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 27 children with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, 16 (59%) had poor visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor visual outcome occurred in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, and head trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Good visual outcome occurred in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypotensive episodes</z:e> after cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 children with recovery of vision, the interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> to partial or total recovery was 2 weeks to 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven children had complete recovery of vision with no residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of children (87%) had focal or multifocal spike-and-waves and slow sharp-wave discharges on electroencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None had photic recruitment response or occipital spike-and-wave discharges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flash visual evoked potential studies performed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>cortical blindness</z:hpo> documented 11 with absent response, 10 with bilateral increases in latency, and 6 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual evoked potentials and a good visual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only 2 of 6 children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Abnormal or absent responses are more predictive of a poor recovery of vision because only 3 of 21 (14%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vision on subsequent examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abnormal electroencephalographic findings with focal or multifocal spike-and-wave discharges or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> on cranial computed tomography are also poor prognostic signs </plain></SENT>
