<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of a proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> should not be viewed as an insurmountable predictor of tPA failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because tPA works by induction of partial recanalization of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, early augmentation of fibrinolysis to improve recanalization is desirable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This augmentation is feasible and can be safely achieved at the bedside with diagnostic Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the CLOTBUST trial, 83% of patients achieved any recanalization (46% complete, 27% partial) with tPA+transcranial Doppler vs 50% (17% complete, 33% partial) with tPA alone within 2 hours of treatment (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sustained, complete recanalization at 2 hours was 38% vs 13%, respectively (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis of 6 randomized and 3 nonrandomized clinical studies of sonothrombolysis showed that any diagnostic ultrasound monitoring can at least double the chance of early complete arterial recanalization at no increase in the risk of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because application in humans of frequencies below the diagnostic range resulted in increased symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> rates, mechanisms by which megahertz and kilohertz frequencies interact with the clot-residual flow interface and endothelium are currently under renewed investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Catheter-based ultrasound delivery to arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and intraventricular clots is the subject of ongoing clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of gaseous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31980">perflutren</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> microspheres to tPA and transcranial Doppler can further facilitate early flow improvement, with a 50% rate of early, complete recanalization in a recent feasibility study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transcranial ultrasound delivery in an operator-independent and dose-controlled manner is being tested in a clinical trial </plain></SENT>
