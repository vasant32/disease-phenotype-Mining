<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It could be stated that out of the total of 1550 cases of cerebrovascular diseases registered the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thromboses</z:e> was essentially higher and that of cerebral haemorrhage markedly lower as compared to data given in the international literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients with cerebrovascular diseases treated in the hospital of the 7th District were also included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed cerebral haemorrhages to occur more frequently as compared to the number of those treated in the territory; the number of thromboses was also significantly higher in these clinical patients as compared to international data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of a more precise diagnosis the autopsy results of patients with cerebrovascular diseases who were treated and died in hospital were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>-cerebral haemorrhage ratio corroborated the clinically established diagnostic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autopsy results revealed the existence of a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of severity in patients with a cerebrovascular disease revealed no difference as compared to other patients who died primarily because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It showed, however, a pronounced deviation in patients who died because of <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A more detailed investigation of these findings will be a future task </plain></SENT>
