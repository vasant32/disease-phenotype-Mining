<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: A new embolic agent, bioabsorbable polymeric material (BPM), was incorporated into Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) to improve long-term anatomical results in the endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated whether BPM-mounted GDCs (BPM/GDCs) accelerated the histopathological transformation of unorganized blood clot into fibrous connective tissue in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> created in swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were created in 12 swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each animal, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was embolized using BPM/GDCs and the other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was embolized using standard GDCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparative angiographic and histopathological data were analyzed at 2 weeks and 3 months postembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 14 days postembolization, angiograms revealed evidence of neck neointima in six of eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with BPM/GDCs compared with zero of eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with standard GDCs (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months postembolization, angiograms demonstrated that four of four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with BPM/GDC were smaller and had neck neointima compared with zero of four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with standard GDCs (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 14 days, histological analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> healing favored BPM/GDC treatment (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p &lt; 0.05): the grade of cellular reaction around the coils was 3 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- standard deviation) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated using BPM/GDCs compared with 1.6 +/- 0.7 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated using GDCs alone; the percentage of unorganized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was 16 +/- 12% compared with 37 +/- 15%, and the neck neointima thickness was 0.65 +/- 0.26 mm compared with 0.24 +/- 0.21 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 months postembolization, only neck neointima thickness was significantly different (p &lt; 0.05): 0.73 +/- 0.37 mm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> filled with BPM/GDCs compared with 0.16 +/- 0.14 mm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> filled with standard GDCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in swine, BPM/GDCs accelerated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and intensified neck neointima formation without causing parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of BPM/GDCs may improve long-term anatomical outcomes by decreasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recanalization due to stronger in situ anchoring of coils by organized fibrous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The retraction of this scar tissue may also decrease the size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and clinical manifestations of mass effect observed in large or giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
