<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) vascular hyperintensities (FVH) are commonly encountered on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies performed shortly after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior reports have speculated regarding the pathogenesis of this finding, yet definitive correlative angiographic studies have not been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the pathophysiologic and hemodynamic correlates of FVH on conventional angiography and concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of FLAIR and gradient-refocused echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging sequences acquired immediately before conventional angiography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was conducted in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence, location, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of FVH were noted and correlated with markers of thrombotic occlusion and collateral flow on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic collaterals were graded on a 5-point scale incorporating extent and hemodynamic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> registry of 632 patients was searched to identify 74 patients (mean age, 63.4 +/- 20 years; 48% women) having undergone FLAIR sequences immediately before angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time from FLAIR to angiography was 2.9 hours (interquartile range, 1.1-4.7 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FVH were present in 53/74 (72%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases with subsequent angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FVH distal to an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were associated with a high grade of leptomeningeal collateral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FVH are observed in areas of blood flow proximal and distal to stenosis or occlusion and are noted with more extensive collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
