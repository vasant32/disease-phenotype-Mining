<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the role of lamina terminalis fenestration combined with cisternal blood evacuation in HGSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/MATERIALS AND METHODS: A clinical, prospective, non-randomized study of a series of HGSAH patients (Modified Fisher&gt;or=3) treated in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microsurgical treatment included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping, cisternal blood evacuation, and fenestration of the lamina terminalis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A comparable, non-blood-cleansed, endovascular-treated group, was included as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical results were evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a period of 30 months, 95 patients who met the selection criteria were treated by microsurgical procedures and 28 by endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of GOS scores was superior for the microsurgical group: good results (GOS 4-5) were obtained in 85.3%, with a mortality rate of 5.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, 60.3% of patients in the endovascular group achieved GOS 4-5 scores, and 15.8% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good results for the endovascular group correlated inversely with delay of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A permanent ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was necessary in 3.2% and 7.1% of the microsurgical and endovascular groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was 3.1% and 14.3% for the microsurgical and endovascular groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Microsurgical management reduces the usually poor outcome of patients with HGSAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lamina terminalis fenestration diminishes the incidence of shunt-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and, combined with extensive cisternal blood cleansing, can lower the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A procedure for cleansing blood and clots from the cisterns in HGSAH, based on the pathophysiology of vasospasm, is proposed </plain></SENT>
