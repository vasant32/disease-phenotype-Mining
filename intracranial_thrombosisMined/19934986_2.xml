<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess the long-term anatomic and clinical outcomes in patients with giant middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by endovascular coil embolization alone or in combination with cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients with giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> were endovascularly treated at the University of California, Los Angeles, between 1990 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 9 patients had partially thrombosed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with incorporated branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients presented with symptoms of mass effect, 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 2 had episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, and 1 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three wide-neck saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were almost completely coil occluded, leaving only small neck remnants that were intended to preserve the patency of incorporated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other 6 fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were effectively treated by superficial temporal artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or occipital artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass, followed by complete coil occlusion of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate angiograms and mid- or long-term neuroradiological imaging follow-up examinations revealed complete obliteration or near-complete occlusion (90%-99%) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had a favorable long-term clinical outcome, and 1 patient died as a result of unrelated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient required emergent surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> thrombectomy because of inadvertent coil occlusion of the frontal opercular artery, which was not protected by the bypass, and the patient subsequently sustained a moderate neurological disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Giant <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with branch incorporations and other unfavorable features such as intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombus, mural</z:e> calcification, and fusiform configuration can be effectively treated with a team approach, using coil embolization after protective surgical bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches incorporated into the neck rather than the dome are treated by endovascular techniques alone, long-term angiographic follow-up is necessary to assess and further treat any significant remnant </plain></SENT>
