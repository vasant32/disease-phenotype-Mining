<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the relation between intake of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> and subsequent incidence of cerebrovascular disease (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A cohort study carried out among 9208 Finnish men and women 15 y or more of age and initially free from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During a 28 y follow-up period in 1967-1994, a total of 824 cases with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Food consumption data were collected using a dietary history interview method covering the total habitual diet during the previous year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">Quercetin</z:chebi> intake was not associated with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative risk of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> adjusted for age, serum cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, geographical area, occupation and intake of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17579">beta-carotene</z:chebi>, vitamin E, <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, fibre, various fatty acids, and energy between the highest and lowest quartiles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> intake was 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.71-1.38) for men and 0.85 (CI=0.60-1.21) for women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, apples, the major source of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> in the study population, showed a significant inverse association both in men and women, mainly due to an association with thrombotic or embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative risks of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after further adjustment for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> intake were 0.59 (CI=0.35-0.99; P=0.45) and 0.61 (CI=0.33-1.12: P for trend=0.02) for men and women, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the intake of apples is related to a decreased risk of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This association apparently is not due to the presence of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">quercetin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
