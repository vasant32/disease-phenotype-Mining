<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">Lipoproteins</z:chebi> were dialyzed into copper dichloride solution to study the effects of soycreme administration on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was drawn from 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> who were not administered soycreme, 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> who were administered soycreme and 11 healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were dialyzed into 5 mol/l copper dichloride solution for various lengths of time, and then <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> constituents in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were measured by thin-layer chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the dialysis, percentages of cholesteryl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> in various <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01) in both patient groups and in healthy persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spot X1 was found between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and free fatty acid on the thin-layer chromatography, and spot X2 was located between free fatty acid and free cholesterol after dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spots X1 and X2 reflect <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
