<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of CVT associated to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> De <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1405947" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Quervain</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> in a young female who was an heterozygous carrier for the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old female with irrelevant past medical history developed a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagital and right transverse sinus in the initial phase of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was made by thyroid radioactive <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> uptake, and cerebral computerized tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> was started until thyroid function was normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When CVT diagnosis was made, the patient was treated with anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two months later, magnetic resonance imaging showed resolution of the CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed as an heterozygous carrier for the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene by genetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>Subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> might act as a risk factor for CVT, increasing the thrombotic risk in the presence of other acquired or hereditary prothrombotic factors, such as the G20210A mutation of the prothrombin gene in our patient </plain></SENT>
