<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: It is well known that cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) present with variable degrees of contrast enhancement on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is attributed to the presence of a low flow vascular architecture in these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether an additional reason for the different degree of contrast enhancement could be the degree of internal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients with surgically removed CCMs were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, standard preoperative MRI (1.5 Tesla, T1 weighted images without and with contrast agent, slice thickness 5 mm, 0.1 mmol <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>/kg body weight, and delay ∼5 minutes) and a histological specimen were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of contrast enhancement (none, little, moderate, and marked) was rated by two independent neuroradiologists blinded to the results of histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The degree of internal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (none, little, moderate, and marked) was rated by a neuropathologist blinded to the results of MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Contrast enhancement was visible in six (43%) CCMs (Cohen's κ = 0.76 or substantial) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of contrast enhancement was not dependent on the degree of internal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (P = 0.1, Fisher's exact test) and did not correlate with it (r = 0.06, P = 0.83, Pearson's correlation coefficient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The flow characteristics of CCMs seem to be the main factor contributing to the degree of contrast enhancement while the degree of internal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> does not influence their contrast affinity </plain></SENT>
