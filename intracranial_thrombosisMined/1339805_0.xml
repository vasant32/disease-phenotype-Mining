<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is sometimes very difficult to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002622'>dissecting aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (DAA), particularly in its early stage, due to manifold signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to clarify the reasons for such erroneous diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 patients with DAA were referred to our hospitals for further examination and/or surgery from April 1986 to August 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 18 of these patients, the diagnostic possibility of an underlying DAA was overlooked by the referring physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these 18 patients, 2 were mistakenly diagnosed as uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), one as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, 2 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, 6 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdominal disease, one as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001081'>cholelithiasis</z:hpo>, 5 as <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the lower extremities, and one as malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> to the pericardium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following is the detail: In 2 cases thought to be uncomplicated MI, an expanding dissecting ascending aorta had crushed the lumen of the left coronary artery, causing MI, in turn, <z:mp ids='MP_0005150'>wasting</z:mp> clinical treatment and consuming precious time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, enlargement of the descending aorta on the chest radiography was overlooked and the patient's symptoms were mistakenly attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases in which symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were thought to be attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, the real cause turned out to be occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 6 cases which were initially considered to have only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> abdominal disease, 3 presented with symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>, and their exploratory laparotomies yielded no positive findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
