<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although prior studies have demonstrated that 25% to 35% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients have had a recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as a risk factor remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to characterize the effect of infectious/inflammatory syndromes on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case-control and crossover analyses of 233 cases and 363 controls aged 21 to 89 years were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were patients hospitalized with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at a Los Angeles, California, medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Controls were outpatients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and general medical clinics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects were administered a neurological examination, an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> (I/I) examination, and an interview to elicit recent I/I history at baseline (within several days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and again approximately 2 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three physicians classified subjects by the presence or absence of I/I within 1 month of the index dates, based on findings of the I/I examination, the interview report, and laboratory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e>, either total or specific, were not found more frequently in cases than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> suffered more often from large-vessel atherothromboembolic or cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than did patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (48% vs 24%, P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk estimate for these subtypes was 1.75 (95% CI, 0.86 to 3.55) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk was notably high for those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors: 4.15 (95% CI, 1.22 to 14.1) for normotensives, 2.71 (95% CI, 1.04 to 7.06) for nondiabetics, and 1.74 (95% CI, 0.74 to 4.07) for nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory infection</z:hpo> also had a more severe neurological deficit on admission than those without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (P=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> may act as a trigger and increase the risk of large-vessel and/or cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, especially in those without vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
