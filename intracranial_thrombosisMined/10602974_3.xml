<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with various cerebrovascular disorders underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA on a 1.0-T system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty sections (2 mm) were acquired in 29-30 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum intensity projection images and subtracted source images were compared with those obtained by conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the presence or absence of abnormalities in the targeted vessels, as well as the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the sagittal sinuses, was clearly visualized as in conventional angiography, without any obstructions such as hyperintense <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, or intraluminal turbulence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the temporal and spatial resolutions with current hardware are insufficient, these preliminary results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRA with subtraction may be useful for assessing vascular lesions with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, and the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
