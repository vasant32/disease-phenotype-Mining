<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the first year, the annual incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> were 167 and 49 per 100,000 population, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> accounted for 76, 13, 8 and 3% of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rate and distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by type agree well with other population-based studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The large size of the population in the Lehigh Valley means that information on the epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as well as the effects of various therapies on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> frequency and outcome, can be collected in a shorter period of time than in most other communities studied to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, an assessment of concordance in diagnosis between attending physicians and a neurologist using standardized criteria was possible for the entire community </plain></SENT>
