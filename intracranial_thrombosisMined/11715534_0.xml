<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 18 patients with intravascular occlusive disease were treated with pulsed-spray thrombolysis(PST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration of urokinase was 10,000 U/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of urokinase was 10,000 U/min, the total dose was from 300,000 U to 800,000 U, and the average dose was 380,000 U </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 18 cases, 14 were obtained thrombolysis completely(77.8%), the cases of thrombolysis partly and unaffected were 2(11.1%) and 2(11.1%) in number respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time of thrombolysis was 2.8 hours </plain></SENT>
