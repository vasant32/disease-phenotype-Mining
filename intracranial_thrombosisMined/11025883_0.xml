<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We encountered a case with a giant partially-thrombosed vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> successfully treated by endovascular trapping following a surgical parent artery clipping two years previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient complained only of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> on her admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial CT showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and MRI of the left anterior aspect of the pons showed flow void and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiogram showed fusiform <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the left vertebral artery just proximal to the vertebral union </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At first, the patient was treated by surgical proximal clipping of the left vertebral artery, under a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her symptom improved and the angiogram showed a slight retrograde aneurysmal filling after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two years later, she complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo>, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, and hemidysesthesia caused by the compression of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On MRI study, a partially-thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was detected in the left anterior aspect of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The retrograde filling did not change remarkably on the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We performed the GDC embolization of the left distal vertebral artery and non-thrombosed residual neck with an assisting balloon positioned through the right vertebral artery to the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the embolization, the patient's neurological deficits caused by the compression of the brain stem disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI study showed the mass volume reducing gradually over a two-years follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Treatment for a partially-thrombosed giant vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is difficult and controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to shut off the blood flow into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> completely, so we consider that endovascular trapping with intraaneurysmal embolization is the most effective procedure </plain></SENT>
