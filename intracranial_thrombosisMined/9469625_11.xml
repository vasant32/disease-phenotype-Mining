<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, it manifests its <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> effect by binding directly to the active site of thrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A phase II double-blind comparative study was conducted in 52 facilities with a placebo control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The drug was administered by a slow intravenous infusion at 60 mg/d for the first 2 days and then at 10 mg twice daily for the subsequent 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi> was used concomitantly as a basic therapy for both the argatroban and placebo groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated superior improvements, particularly in neurological symptoms (motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>) and daily living activities (walking, standing up, continuous sitting, and eating), in the argatroban group compared with the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These improvements were observed from the early stage of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also found that administration of the drug in the early stage of the disease gave better results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the present study, although a hemorrhagic cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> occurred in one case in the argatroban group, this seemed to be no different from a spontaneous incidence, as it also occurred in two cases in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were not aggravated in any of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that argatroban is an effective and safe drug for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
