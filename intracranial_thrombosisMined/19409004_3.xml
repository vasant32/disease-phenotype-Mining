<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> may grow closer to anterior optic pathways, causing mass effect over these anatomical structures, including visual deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors retrospectively reviewed a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients presenting with visual field deficit caused by mass effect, to analyze the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>'s characteristics, the neurosurgical management of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, as well as their clinical, visual, and radiological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical charts, neuroimaging examination results, and surgical videos of 15 patients presenting with visual symptoms caused by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>'s mass effect over the anterior optic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Center of Neurology and Neurosurgery Associates, Hospital Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo, Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed to identify the variables related to partial or total recovery of the visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent microsurgical clip placement and emptying of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 38.5 months, the mean postoperative Glasgow Outcome Scale score was 4.33, and the visual outcomes were as follows: 1 patient (6.6%) unchanged, 7 (46.6%) improved, and 7 (46.6%) experienced complete recovery from visual deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The variables that influenced the visual outcomes were the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p = 0.039), duration of the visual symptoms (p = 0.002), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall calcification (p = 0.010), and intraluminal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative examination using digital subtraction angiography showed complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion in 14 (93.3%) of the 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>Intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> causing mass effect over the anterior optic pathways usually present with complex features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best treatment option must include not only the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion but also relief of the mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical clip placement with reduction of aneurysmal mass effect achieved improvement in visual ability or recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo>, as well as total <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion, in 93.3% of the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this option is well supported as the first choice of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with mass effect over the anterior visual pathways </plain></SENT>
