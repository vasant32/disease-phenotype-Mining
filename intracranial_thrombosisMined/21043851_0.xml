<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To detect in vivo activated platelets in humans as well as in animal models of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we developed a new murine monoclonal antibody, 2T60, specific for activated human and rabbit platelets by immunizing with human thronibin-activated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2T60 (IgG(1) subclass) showed a great difference between binding to the thrombin-activated and resting human and rabbit platelets on ELISA and flow cytometer analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting analysis revealed that 2T60 reacted with a 130 or 106 kDa protein of human or rabbit platelets, respectively, only under non-reducing conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(125)I-labeled 2T60 inserted into the intermediate gel of CIE of solubilized human platelets was incorporated into a immunoprecipitation line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2T60 immunoprecipitated a protein of 130 or 115 kDa from human or rabbit platelets, respectively, which had been activated and (125)I-surface-labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal sequence of the affinity purified 2T60 antigen of human platelets was identical to that of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> 140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were differences in the carbohydrate chain content of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi> 140 between human and rabbit platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> of rabbits that had been injected with 2T60, the platelets adhering to the exposed subendothelium and contained in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were found to bind 2T60 prominently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that 2T60 may be a useful tool for clinical and experimental studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
