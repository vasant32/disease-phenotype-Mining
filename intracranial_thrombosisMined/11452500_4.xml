<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission she complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> with dizziness but <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> could not be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed a mild high density lesion in the right ambient cistern and the density of the lesion had become much higher 5 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed a homogeneous iso-intense lesion on T1WI, T2WI 2 days after admission and the lesion had changed to homogeneous high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesion was suspected to be a fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right vertebral angiography showed a part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the ambient segment of the right superior cerebellar artery and we diagnosed the lesion as a partially thrombosed superior cerebellar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About forty cases of peripheral superior cerebellar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> have been described in the literature, but cases of spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have been very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was usually thought to occur in large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in our case was not large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suspected that in our case spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> may have been caused by occlusion of the parent artery of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
