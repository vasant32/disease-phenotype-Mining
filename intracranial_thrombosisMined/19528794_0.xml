<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in SCD patients due to vasooclusion, thrombotic manifestations in peripheral vessels are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with homozygous SCD present a variety of renal abnormalities as a result of sickle crisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this group of patients, kidney transplantation has been performed in the renal endstage patients; with graft survival rates similar to that of the general transplant population at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients with SCD experience an augmentation in the frequency of painful crises in the first year after transplantation, which has been attributed to concurrent elevations in hematocrit and plasma viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite etiology, renal transplant patients are at increased risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and renovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after allograft procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These events can be due to a prothrombotic state generated by the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although other factors such as acquired or inherited disorders of the clotting system may increase the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a case of a renal transplant patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> who presented recurrent episodes of DVT and increase painful sickle episodes after kidney transplantation </plain></SENT>
