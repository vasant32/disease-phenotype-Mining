<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A malignant profile of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> has been demonstrated in the Diffusion and Perfusion Imaging Evaluation for Understanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Evolution (DEFUSE) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with a malignant profile had a low chance for an independent functional outcome despite thrombolysis within 3-6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether CT angiography (CTA) could identify a malignant imaging profile within 3 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied consecutive patients (04/02-09/07) with anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who received CTA before intravenous thrombolysis within 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on CTA source images (CTASI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Intracranial thrombus</z:e> burden on CTA was assessed with a novel 10-point clot burden score (CBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed percentages independent (modified Rankin Scale score &lt; or =2) and fatal outcome at 3 months and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> rates across categorized combined CTASI-ASPECTS + CBS score groups where 20 is best and 0 is worst </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 114 patients (median age 73 years [interquartile range 61-80], <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-tPA time 129 min [95-152]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 24 patients (21%) with extensive hypoattenuation on CTASI and extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> burden (combined score &lt; or =10), only 4% (1/24) were functionally independent whereas mortality was 50% (12/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 57% (51/90) of patients with less affected scores (combined score 11-20) were functionally independent and mortality was 10% (9/90; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> rates were 30% (7/23) vs. 8% (7/88), respectively (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA identifies a large hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> population with high mortality and low likelihood for independent functional outcome despite early thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
