<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine if increasing age adversely affects prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Merci thrombectomy cases and compared patients younger than 80 years of age with older individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared these 2 age groups with respect to recanalization rates, hospital LOS, hemorrhagic transformation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elderly patients were more likely to die from their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those younger than 80 years of age, regardless of recanalization success (48% versus 15%; OR, 5.5; 95% CI, 2.1-14.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among survivors, there was no difference in the probability of having a good functional outcome (mRS, &lt;or=2) by discharge (38% versus 40%; OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.3-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation did not vary between age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusions</z:e>, increased age conveys a higher rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, but disability at discharge in this group is similar to that of younger survivors </plain></SENT>
