<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, free and total iron levels in cortical tissue and free iron levels in plasma were measured before and after (1, 4 and 24h) photothrombotic occlusion of cortical vessels in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain ferritin expression and localization were also investigated before and after (24, 72 and 192 h) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that free iron remained below detectable levels in plasma and that the lesion exhibited high levels of free and total iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared to contralateral values, free iron levels in ischemic core and penumbra increased (+50%) at 1h and returned to control values at 4h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increase in total iron levels (+20-30%) was long-lasting, but confined to the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A time-dependent increase in the expression of both chains of ferritin was detected in regions that previously exhibited free iron accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, ischemic damage was reduced by the liposoluble iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30351">2,2'-dipyridyl</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg, i.p.) when injected 15 min or 1 h post-occlusion, yet not later (4 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results show that focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> results in an early and transient elevation in free iron levels in the ischemic tissue and suggest that free iron excess does not originate in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also highlight the importance of starting iron chelation therapy as soon as possible after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
