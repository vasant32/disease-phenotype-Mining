<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> Hounsfield unit quantification as a predictive marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization after intravenous rtPA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: NCCT scans and CTA were performed on patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 4.5 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, vessel hyperattenuation, occlusion site, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> length, and time to thrombolysis were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> origin was categorized as LAA, cardioembolic, or indeterminate according to TOAST criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two blinded neuroradiologists calculated the Hounsfield unit values for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used ROC curves to determine the rHU cutoff point to discriminate patients with successful recanalization from those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We assessed the accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) of rHU in the prediction of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 87 consecutive patients, 45 received intravenous rtPA and only 15 (33.3%) patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rHU values and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism were the highest predictive factors of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Matthews correlation coefficient was highest for rHU (0.901) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for lack of recanalization after intravenous rtPA for rHU â‰¤ 1.382 were 100%, 86.67%, 93.75%, and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LAA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> had lower rHU than cardioembolic and indeterminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Hounsfield unit <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> measurement ratio can predict recanalization with intravenous rtPA and may have clinical utility for endovascular treatment decision making </plain></SENT>
