<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated temporal profiles of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in rats in relation to sensorimotor impairment after photochemically induced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult, male Wistar rats were injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> dye followed by illumination to produce a lesion over the sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain damage including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was determined from postoperative days 1 to 10 by using MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining was used to confirm <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in perfused brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed by limb-placing test during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consistent cortical lesion was detected in T(2) weighted MRI 24h after cortical photothrombosis without any signs of blood in T(2)(*) weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, from postoperative days 3 to 8, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was indicated by almost complete signal void in T(2)(*) weighted gradient echo images and confirmed by Perls' <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> staining on postoperative day 10 for presence of iron in corresponding lesion areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> appearance of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on postoperative days 3-8 and resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> coincides with improved performance in the limb-placing test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> around cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is part of the wound healing process and may not impair functional outcome </plain></SENT>
