<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Recently two classification methods based on the location and the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> detected with CT angiography have been introduced: the Boston <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Imaging Scale (BASIS) and the clot burden score (CBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the performance of BASIS and CBS in predicting good clinical outcome (mRS â‰¤ 2 at 90 days) in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (&lt; 3 h) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-three consecutive patients who underwent multimodal CT were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression model was used to assess how BASIS, CBS, and cerebral blood volume (CBV) ASPECTS predict favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with low CBS and CBV ASPECTS scores and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> according to BASIS had significantly higher admission NIHSS scores, larger perfusion defects, and more often poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression analysis, CBV ASPECTS, CBS and BASIS were significantly associated with the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The performance of BASIS improved when patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery were classified as having minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (M1-BASIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the anterior circulation, the sum of CBS and CBV ASPECTS (CBSV) proved to be the most robust predictor of favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CBV ASPECTS and CBS had high sensitivity but moderate to poor specificity while BASIS was only moderately sensitive and specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CBS, BASIS, and CBV ASPECTS are statistically robust and sensitive but unspecific predictors of good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two new derived imaging parameters, CBSV and M1-BASIS, share these properties and may have increased prognostic value </plain></SENT>
