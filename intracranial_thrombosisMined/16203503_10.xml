<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Scientific evidence that moderate amounts prolonged life, published in 1926, was ignored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further evidence accumulated from the early 1950s but the belief that alcohol was only harmful had become so ingrained that the idea has been taken seriously only since the early 1980s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Now, the evidence that small amounts reduce the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> by about a third and reduce total mortality in middle and old age is massive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Alternative explanations for the observed inverse relationships have been ruled out and beneficial effects have been shown to be biologically plausible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reduction in mortality is mainly attributable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, but some other diseases may also contribute to it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increasing mortality with larger amounts is attributable to many causes that have long been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimum level varies with sex and age and may be zero under about age 45 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The benefit is directly due to <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> and the extra benefit attributed to wine is due to the pattern of drinking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Public policy needs to take account of medical and social effects other than mortality and will vary in different communities depending on background patterns of injury and disease </plain></SENT>
