<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The photosensitizer <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> was injected through the tail vein and then the cool <z:chebi fb="62" ids="24473">halogen</z:chebi> light illuminated the skull region overlying of the olfactory bulb for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after surgery, P-bulbectomy had completely removed olfactory bulb uniformly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P-bulbectomy induced typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>-related behaviors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> in the open field test and an enhancement of immobility time and in the forced swimming test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo>-related neurohistological phenomenon was also seen; reduction of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>-acetyltransferase-positive cell numbers in the medial septum and a decline in cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study shows that P-bulbectomy may be a convenient and reproducible experimental method to produce an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
