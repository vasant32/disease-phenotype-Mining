<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe our initial experience with the use of this device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 27 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> presenting at our center from January to October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the degree of recanalization measured by thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI grade 2/3) at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were the proportion of patients who achieved a modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤2 at 3 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) on non contrast computed tomography at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedural complications were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 27 patients (13 male, mean age 61 years) in the study, 22 (81%) patients had anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and five (18%) had posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (85%) patients achieved TIMI grade 2/3 recanalization at completion of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excluding five patients who needed use of a second device, the Penumbra system achieved TIMI grade 2/3 recanalization in 67% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (48%) patients had mRS ≤2 at 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedural and post-procedural complications included vasospasm (3.7%), distal emboli (48.1%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> is as follows: hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> type 1 (25.9%), parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> type 1 (3.7%), and parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> type 2 (3.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High recanalization rates and good clinical outcomes are achievable with the Penumbra system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complication rates are comparable to a previously published literature </plain></SENT>
