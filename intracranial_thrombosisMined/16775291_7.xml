<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: When using detachable coils to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> is the most feared and frequently reported complication during or after endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to document the therapeutic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> on patency of the parent vessel, rate of rebleedings, and outcome of the patients in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A patient data base was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occurred during endovascular treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> within a 34-month period and who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> during endovascular treatment procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (age range, 52.9 +/- 10.7 years; 10 women, 6 men) were identified with intraprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patency of the parent vessel was assessed in a retrospective analysis blinded to outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received ventriculostomy and had a follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local nonocclusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> at the coil surface was detected in 5 patients, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was dissolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients, partial or total occlusion of the parent vessel occurred during the intervention; in 8 of these, the vessel was recanalized completely and in 2 drug administration was assisted by mechanical means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient, however, the occlusion persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No periprocedural rebleedings of the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occurred; 3 of 8 ventriculostomies had clinically silent small local <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> in the setting of endovascular treatment of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> to dissolve platelet aggregation seems relatively safe and effective </plain></SENT>
