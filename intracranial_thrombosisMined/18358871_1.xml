<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term functional and cognitive outcome in CVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients admitted to the Neurology department of the Amiens university hospital between January 1997 and December 2002 with the diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome between April and June 2003 was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with cognitive complaints or impaired, MMSE were assessed using a standardized neuropsychological battery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004930" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">behavioral disorder</z:e> assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 26 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria, 16agreed to participate and formed the study population (13 women; median age: 46.8years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 34.5months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional ability assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRk) was relatively spared (mRk=0; n=6; mRk=1; n=6; mRk=2; n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with cognitive complaints underwent a detailed neuropsychological assessment: it revealed deficits of long-term memory and executive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite relatively good functional long-term outcome, our results indicate that CVT patients suffer from long-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficit</z:e> and moderate executive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such a pattern is close to that observed in arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> although less severe and this warrants a larger study </plain></SENT>
