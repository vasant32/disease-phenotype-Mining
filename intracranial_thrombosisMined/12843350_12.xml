<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombin-induced clots used in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> differ from clots forming spontaneously under clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether this difference influences the efficacy and outcome of thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In rats, the middle cerebral artery was occluded by intracarotid injection of fibrin-rich clots, prepared either according to established methods by adding thrombin to freshly drawn arterial blood or by spontaneous coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanical properties of clots were determined in vitro by elasticity and plasticity tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hour after embolism, thrombolysis was started by intra-arterial application of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) (10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment efficacy was monitored by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measurements of blood perfusion, apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), T2 relaxation time and blood-brain barrier permeability, and by pictorial measurements of ATP and pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombin-induced clots were classified as elastic, and spontaneously forming clots were classified as plastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery embolism</z:e> with thrombin-induced or spontaneously forming clots led to similar reduction of perfusion and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, but rtPA treatment efficacy differed greatly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the spontaneously forming clot group, blood perfusion returned to or above control within 2 hours, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and ATP normalized, tissue pH exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo>, and T2 and blood-brain barrier permeability did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the thrombin-induced clot group, in contrast, blood reperfusion was delayed, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> and ATP remained reduced, tissue pH was acidic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> developed, as reflected by increased T2 and blood-brain barrier permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rtPA-induced thrombolysis promotes rapid reperfusion and tissue recovery in animals embolized with spontaneously forming clots but not in those embolized with thrombin-induced clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference is explained by the different mechanical and possibly molecular consequences of clot preparation and must be considered for the interpretation of thrombolysis experiments </plain></SENT>
