<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The goal of this study was to determine the frequency with which cerebral intravascular coagulation (IC) complicates traumatic brain injury (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors also investigated the incidence of IC in relation to varying mechanisms, time courses, and severities of TBI and in different species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Tissue was sampled from surgical specimens of human cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp>, from rats with lateral fluid-percussion injuries, and from pigs with head rotational acceleration injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical fluorescent staining for antithrombin III was performed to detect cerebral intravascular microthrombi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abundant IC was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> specimens, and microthrombi had formed in arterioles and venules of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sizes, ranging from 10 to 600 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although it was more pronounced in focal lesions and more severe injuries, considerable IC was also observed in mild and diffuse injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors found a strong association between the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> and the density of IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly support the contention that IC is a universal response to TBI and an important secondary cerebral insult </plain></SENT>
