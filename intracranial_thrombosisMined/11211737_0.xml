<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus and a cortical vein of the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A linear hyperintense area was found in the white matter of the right postcentral gyrus on T 2- and diffusion weighted axial imagings on the 7 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated conservatively, and his clinical course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His neurological dysfunctions recovered within approximately three weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The white matter lesion in the right postcentral gyrus also disappeared one month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi>) in the white matter of the pre- and postcentral gyrus were measured bilaterally on the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> mapping imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in the white matter of the right pre- and postcentral gyrus were 0.50 x 10(-3) mm2/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> and 0.91 x 10(-3) mm2/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The %<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> indicating the ratio of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value of the lesion to that of the contralateral brain tissue was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The %<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> in the white matter of the pre- and postcentral gyrus were 64.9% and 124.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values in the white matter of the right pre- and postcentral gyrus were 0.96 x 10(-3) mm2/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> and 0.99 x 10(-3) mm2/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi>, and the %<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADCs</z:chebi> improved to 106.7% and 106.5% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The lesions in the white matter of the right pre- and postcentral gyrus were reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The former was thought to be mainly ascribed to cellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the latter was vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present case showed when %<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> of the ischemic lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was higher than 60%-70%, conservative therapy alone is sufficient effective for the improvement of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
