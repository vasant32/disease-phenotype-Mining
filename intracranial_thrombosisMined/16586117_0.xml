<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is a common disease associated with high mortality and significant long-term disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment options for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> continue to evolve and include pharmaceutical and mechanical therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of a new device for mechanical thrombectomy, the options available for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> have been expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy is generally given intravenously in the first 3 h and up to 6 h via the intraarterial route for pharmacological clot disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum time-frame for mechanical thrombectomy devices has yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 78-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a dense right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, leftward gaze preference and dense global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, left carotid angiography confirmed a left internal carotid artery terminus occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single pass was made through the clot with an X6 Merci Retriever device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a single pass, the vessel was reopened and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow in the left internal carotid artery was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the time of discharge, her neurological deficits had improved significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging, was probably much smaller than it would have been if the vessel had not been recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We report the use of a new mechanical thrombectomy device 8 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic symptoms, with substantial subsequent improvement in neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, use of the Merci Retriever can result in improved outcomes beyond the traditional 6-h window used for intraarterial pharmacological thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
