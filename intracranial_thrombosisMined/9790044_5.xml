<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the discrepancies in the accumulation of these tracers using dynamic SPECT to detect the super early phase of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with luxury perfusion or high flow states were studied with both dynamic and standard SPECT using Tc-99m HMPAO and Tc-99m <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> within 1-3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard SPECT showed discrepancies in 6 of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> had increased accumulation of Tc-99m HMPAO and decreased uptake of Tc-99m <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> had decreased accumulation of both tracers, but to different degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dynamic SPECT showed increased or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> accumulation (i.e., essentially no discrepancy) in the first few minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, Tc-99m HMPAO had a longer retention time than Tc-99m <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> in the ensuing 5-10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dynamic SPECT revealed a similar accumulation pattern but different washout rates for the two tracers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tc-99m HMPAO might be a more suitable tracer to detect high flow states or luxury perfusion because the findings on standard SPECT were more in agreement with those of dynamic SPECT using this tracer </plain></SENT>
