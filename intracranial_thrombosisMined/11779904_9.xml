<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Platelet activation and deposition in brain microvessels appear to be key events in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that activated platelets in combination with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibrin may play a role in vessel reocclusion leading to the "no-reflow" phenomenon after administration of the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of the novel <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa platelet receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> SM-20302 when administered in combination with tPA on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate and volume to determine whether activated platelets are involved in either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> generation after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred thirty-two male New Zealand White rabbits were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rabbits were embolized by injecting a blood clot into the middle cerebral artery via a catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five or 65 minutes after embolization, SM-20302 (5 mg/kg) was infused intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In drug combination studies, tPA was infused intravenously for 30 minutes starting 60 minutes after embolization, and SM-20302 was administered 5 or 65 minutes after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postmortem analysis included assessment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and location, and clot lysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the vehicle control group, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase (109%) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate in the group of rabbits treated with the thrombolytic tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SM-20302 by itself did not significantly alter the embolism-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate when administered either 5 or 65 minutes after embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The SM-20302 groups had a 42% and 33% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the 5- and 65-minute groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In groups treated with a combination of drugs, the SM-20302/tPA group had a 31% and 71% incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> when SM-20302 was administered 5 and 65 minutes after embolization, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SM-20302 in combination with tPA also significantly increased <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate, but not <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> with the combination of a platelet inhibitor and tPA may have a beneficial outcome on the basis of the following: First, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> administration of SM-20302 did not significantly increase <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Second, SM-20302 in combination with tPA significantly reduced tPA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Third, there appears to be a specific window of opportunity when a platelet inhibitor must be administered to produce a beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Overall, on the basis of our results, we hypothesize that the increased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> observed after tPA administration may be partly due to increased reocclusion of cerebral vessels following lysis of the emboli and that reocclusion can be controlled by administration of a platelet inhibitor </plain></SENT>
