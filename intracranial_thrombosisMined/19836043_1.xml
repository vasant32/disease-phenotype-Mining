<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of our survey was to study the clinical, etiological and progressive aspects of the CVT in Burkina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: We conducted a prospective study for two years, including patients with a diagnosis of CVT based on clinical and imaging criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, clinical findings and results of complementary tests were recorded as was the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 17 patients (seven men and ten women) mean age 42.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inaugural signs were sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in two-thirds of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was a constant finding (n=17 patients, 100%); 15 patients (88%) had unilateral or bilateral motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An infectious syndrome was common (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The brain CT scan generally revealed spontaneous high density signals from a sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>d-dimeres were high in 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients were HIV-1 seropositive and four had rhino-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other etiological factors were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> was administred in 80% of patients, followed by oral anticoagulation for three months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our cohort presents a relatively different clinical picture compared with the literature due to the high frequency of the infectious etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A prospective multicentric study with more specific diagnostic tools could be useful to learn more about the epidemiology of CVT in Subsaharan Africa </plain></SENT>
