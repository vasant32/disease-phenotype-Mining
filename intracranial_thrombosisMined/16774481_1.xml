<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with intravascular coagulation, which may be a result of thromboplastin released following brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clots thus formed are lysed by plasmin, which is activated by tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (uPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the association between traumatic intravascular coagulation and post-traumatic outcome, uPA knockout (uPA-/-) transgenic mice (n=12) or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> littermates (WT; n=12) were anesthetized and subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A second group of uPA-/- (n=12) and WT mice (n=12) were subjected to sham injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor function was assessed over 2 weeks using the composite neuroscore test and cognition (learning) was assessed with the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris Water Maze</z:mp> (MWM) at 2 weeks post-injury, whereupon the animals were sacrificed for cortical lesion volume analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor function was significantly worse in the brain-injured uPA-/- mice when compared to brain-injured WT mice at 48 h (p&lt;0.05) and one week post-injury (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences resolved by 2 weeks post-injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in post-injury cognitive function between uPA-/- mice and WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, at 2 weeks post-injury, the brain-injured uPA-/- had a significantly larger volume of cortical tissue loss than their WT counterparts (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the absence of uPA in mice aggravates <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> motor deficit and exacerbates cortical tissue loss following CCI brain injury, and suggests a neuroprotective role of the fibrinolytic process following TBI </plain></SENT>
