<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 125 participants (24 males and 101 females aged 38 +/- 13 years) were divided into three groups: group 1--SLE patients (n=51); group 2--SLE+APS patients (n=49); group 3--primary APS patients (n=25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients had the disease for 14 +/- 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA) and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) marked APS serologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Homocystein (HC) was assayed by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HHC (HC &gt; 15 mcg/l) was diagnosed in 82 of 125 (66%) patients: in 59% patients of group 1, 67%--of group 2 and 76%--of group 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a relationship between HHC and digital <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (DN): 80% of DN patients had HHC while HHC was diagnosed in 57% patients free of DN (chi-square = 4.76, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Development of occlusions in APS was associated with HHC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of HC in blood was registered in 43 of 55 (78%) APS patients with thromboses vs. 9 of 19 (47%) patients with APS free of thromboses (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HHC occurred significantly more frequently in patients with arterial thromboses (in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 patients) than in patients with venous thromboses (in 16 of 23--69.6%, p = 0.03) and in the absence of thromboses (in 9 of 19, 47.4%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HHC was associated with thromboses of cerebral, peripheral arteries (90 vs. 47% in patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, p = 0.005; 84 vs. 47%, p = 0.04, respectively), coronary vessels (79 vs. 47%, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In APS patients having arterial thromboses with duration of postthrombocytic period (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>), estimated as time from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to entering the trial, less than 2 months, HC concentration was significantly higher (22.9 +/- 7.0 mcg/l) compared to patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> more than 2 years (16.6 +/- 3.7 mcg/l (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More than 50% patients with SLE and APS, irrespective of APS variants, had an elevated HC level in the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Correlation between HHC and development of thromboses, primarily arterial, in APS gives grounds for the role of HHC in development of vascular complications in SLE and APS </plain></SENT>
