<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We describe a methodology for effectively improving the lysis and drainage of intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> during stereotactic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Stereotactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> using a multitrack technique was performed in 20 patients with ganglionic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> perforating into the subcortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) guidance, the trajectories and targets of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> drainage were selected to extract most portions of the irregular and expansive intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Volumes ranged from 36 to 60 mL (mean, 45 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four to 5 drains were inserted into the parenchymal and ventricular clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>Aspiration</z:hpo> and injections of urokinase (5000 IU) were repeated every 2 to 3 hours until the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was almost completely removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The intended catheters for <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> were placed precisely along the predetermined tracks with the aid of 3D-CT visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deep and subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were totally removed within a mean of 10 hours postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple catheter placements itself caused no complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (80%) recovered with a favorable neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The 3D-CT-based multitrack technique is a rapid and effective method for the stereotactic removal of extensive ganglionic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has the advantage of giving better neurological recovery than conventional stereotactic or microscopic surgery for selected patients </plain></SENT>
