<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pregnancy and especially the postpartum constitute supporting circumstances occured of the CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: the aim of our study is to remember the symptomatology of CVT, the importance of the IRM and the angio IRM in the diagnosis of CVT, and its treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: We present a retrospective study relating to 7 cases of CVT during gravidopuerperality over 7 years (1996 to 2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age of our patients is 32.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CVT occured during the first trimester of the pregnancy in one case and in the postpartum in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptomatology was dominated by cephalgia and the signs of intracranian <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>Convulsions</z:mp> occured in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CVT was confirmed by IRM coupled with the Angio-IRM in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment by heparinotherapy was instaured immediately and relayed by the Anti-Vit K as the evolution was favorable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: cerebral venous thrombophebitis (CVT) is a serious pathology (especially in pregnancy and post partum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is performed by the magnetic resonance imaging (IRM) and the early introduction of the heparinotherapy </plain></SENT>
