<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A number of studies have shown that reduced intrauterine growth and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> are associated with raised rates of fatal and nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is modified by growth in childhood or by socioeconomic status in adult life is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied hospital admissions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among 3639 men who were born in Helsinki University Central Hospital during 1924 to 1933 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They had detailed records of their body size at birth, their growth through childhood, and their social circumstances as adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three hundred thirty-one of the men had had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hazard ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> in relation to head circumference (P=0.005) and to short length in relation to head circumference (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These associations were stronger for hemorrhagic than for thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> still had below-average stature at 7 years (P=0.05), but after 7 years their height "caught up" through accelerated growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As adults they had low incomes and low social class (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> may originate through reduced fetal growth, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>low body weight</z:hpo> and short body length at birth but "sparing" of head growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other studies suggest that this pattern of growth is associated with persisting elevation of blood pressure and raised plasma fibrinogen concentrations, 2 known risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is increased by accelerated growth in height during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Accelerated growth has previously been linked to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> risk is further increased by adverse influences linked to low income </plain></SENT>
