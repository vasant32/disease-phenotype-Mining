<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An 18-year-old woman suffered from a deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> located predominantly in the thalami </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stage 2 sleep EEG recorded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting showed preservation of K-complexes but absent 12-14 Hz sleep spindles, which were replaced by spindle-like theta oscillations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One month later, the patient having completely recovered, sleep spindles were normally seen on the control EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates that deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, through a vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, may transiently affect thalamic functions such as spindles generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, thalamic impairment may lead to dissociation of spindle and K-complex activity </plain></SENT>
