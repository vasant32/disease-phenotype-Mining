<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 CVST patients with the mean age of 37.1 +/- 11.7 years and 100 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals from Kermanshah Province of Iran with ethnic background of Kurd were studied for factor V Leiden G1691A, prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR C677T by PCR-RFLP method using Mnl I, Hind III, and Hinf I restriction enzymes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of factor V Leiden was 16.7% in patients and 2% in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant association was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> and CVST with odds ratio (OR) of 9.8 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.68-57.2, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No prothrombin G20210A was found among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients, MTHFR C677T tended to be higher (58.3%) compared to control (44%), OR of 1.8 (95% CI 0.73-4.5, P = .2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study for the first time has determined the prevalence of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in a homogenous ethnic group of CVST patients and suggests that factor V Leiden, and not the prothrombin gene mutation is a risk factor for CVST in Western Iran </plain></SENT>
