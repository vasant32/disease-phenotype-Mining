<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Recent data indicate that both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) exert substantial neuroregenerative effects and improve functional outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we checked for potential differences in the postischemic modulation of various excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors as well as various marker molecules for structural plasticity by BDNF versus G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and subsequently treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi>, BDNF or G-CSF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks, postischemic protein expression of the NR1, GluR1 and alpha2 subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, AMPA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor, respectively, was semiquantitatively determined ipsi- and contralateral to the ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structural plasticity was further analyzed immunohistochemically using antibodies against MAP1B, MAP2 and synaptophysin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only BNDF caused a significantly reduced postischemic protein expression of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor alpha2 subunit and the NR1 subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BDNF compared to G-CSF increased MAP1B protein expression in the periischemic regenerative region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although both BDNF and G-CSF have been shown to improve postischemic functional outcome to a similar extent, exogenous administration results in different underlying structural reorganization processes suggesting specific modulations of plasticity-associated events by these trophic factors </plain></SENT>
