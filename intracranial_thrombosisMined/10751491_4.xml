<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe parenchymal perianeurysmal cystic changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 247 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> described in the medical or radiologic records in three institutions, five had perianeurysmal cystic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These were evaluated with computed tomography or magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and were categorized according to size, appearance, and the presence of hemosiderin deposit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Confirmation at stereotactic needle biopsy was available in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perianeurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> comprised multiple clustered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in three cases and a unilocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> in two, and diameters were 1.5-3.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hemosiderin was depicted at <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in one unilocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had diameters of 0.7-4.0 cm, and prominent aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and calcifications were seen in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings at stereotactic needle biopsy were of mild reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At long-term follow-up in two patients, the cystic regions were stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Parenchymal perianeurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> are rare and may display various morphologic characteristics from unilocular to multilocular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since there may or may not be evidence of previous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, other mechanisms such as <z:mp ids='MP_0000260'>abnormal angiogenesis</z:mp> factors may play a role </plain></SENT>
