<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the recurrence and prognosis of 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with positive IgG aCL who had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular diseases</z:e> with those in 120 patients with negative IgG aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aCL-positive patients comprised 18 females and 2 males aged 43-79 (mean 64) years and the mean follow-up period was 5.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aCL-negative patients comprised 82 males and 38 females aged 40-84 (mean 64.2) years and the mean follow-up period was 5.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in age and mean follow-up period between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the recurrence rate and the intervals from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to the recurrence in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and chronological changes in titer of aCL in patients with positive aCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the effectiveness of antiplatelet agents for the prevention of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A positive aCL level was defined as one which was &gt; 3 standard deviations (S.D.) above the mean level for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high titer of aCL was defined as being &gt; 7 S.D. above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 20 patients with positive aCL, recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 10 (50%) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in 8 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in 2) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> developed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As regards the number of ischemic episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, recurrence occurred twice in 4 and once in 6 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
