<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of treatment in a community hospital setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had received intravenous tPA therapy from 1998 to 2007 in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the characteristics, complications, and outcomes in our patients with those of patients in the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were reviewed with a mean age of 63 years and a male predominance (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median pretreatment National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our patients, cardioembolism was the leading course of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment was 134 minutes, and the mean door-to-computed tomography-time was 34 minutes while the mean door-to-needle time was 93 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within 36 hours symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in two patients (4.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients (9.3%) developed brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> with fatality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, fourteen patients (33%) had a favorable outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (0-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient outcome was not significantly different from that in the NINDS trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although the number of patients with AIS receiving tPA in this study was small, thrombolytic therapy can be performed safely and effectively by physicians in the community hospital setting </plain></SENT>
