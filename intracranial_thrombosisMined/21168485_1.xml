<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human blood clots of 1 ml were incubated with 1 μl of the different <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> dispersions DPPC/CH, DPPC/PEG40S, DSPC/PEG40S and the commercially available ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue® </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clots were stored for 3 days at 5 °C to obtain maximal clot retraction and lytic resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each clot weight was determined before and after continuous insonation for 1h of insonation at 1.4 MHz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pressure in the insonation chamber was 80 mm Hg to mimic middle arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight before insonation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nanoscaled formulations and SonoVue® were able to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight compared to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> of clots that were not insonated but kept under pressure for one hour (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a highly significant weight reduction with DSPC/PEG40S compared to SonoVue® (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nanoscaled DSPC/PEG40S dispersion could be a promising formulation in ultrasound enhanced thrombolysis even without thrombolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stable cavitation is a crucial parameter in fragmentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies of physicochemical properties of DSPC/PEG40S are necessary to corroborate our hypothesis </plain></SENT>
