<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to report the feasibility of using clinical magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging devices for depiction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four rats with photochemically induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the middle cerebral artery were examined at superacute (1 hour, n = 24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (12 hours, n = 12), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> (24 hours, n = 12) phases with 1.5-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging weighted for T1, T2, diffusion, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi>-enhanced perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With reasonable signal-to-noise ratio and imaging times, ischemic lesions were well distinguished on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images as validated qualitatively and quantitatively with postmortem standard-of-reference techniques, including volume-rendered computed tomography, microangiography, and histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the superacute phase, the perfusion defect at perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was well matched with microangiographic and pathologic findings (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in lesion size at perfusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging between superacute and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phases (P &gt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Performance of certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related research in rats is feasible with clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imagers </plain></SENT>
