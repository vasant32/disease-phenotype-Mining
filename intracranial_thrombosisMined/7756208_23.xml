<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> gynaecological, medical, neurological, and neurosurgical departments in Danish hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Seven hundred and ninety-four women in Denmark aged 15 to 44 who suffered a cerebral thromboembolic attack during the period 1985 to 1989 and 1588 age-matched, randomly selected controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESPONSE: Of the 692 case and 1584 control questionnaires sent out, 590 (85.1%) and 1396 (88.1%), respectively, were returned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 590 cases, nine had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> before 1980, 15 refused to participate, 44 had a revised diagnosis (primarily multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>) and 25 had an unreliable diagnosis, leaving 497 with a reliable cerebral thromboembolic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 1396 controls, 26 either refused to participate, were mentally handicapped, lived abroad or returned an uncompleted questionnaire, leaving 1370 controls included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, pregnancy implied an odds ratio (OR) for a cerebral thromboembolic attack of 1.3 (nonsignificant), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> an OR of 5.4 (P &lt; 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> an OR of 3.1 (P &lt; 0.001) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> an OR of 2.8 (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Women with previous non-cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e> had an OR for cerebral thrombo-embolism of 5.3 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Women with other predisposing medical diseases had an OR of 8.3 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These ORs were identical among users and non-users of combined oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study pregnancy implied a non-significant elevated odds ratio of 1.3 for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> whereas <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and past <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> increased the risk of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Women with these increased thrombotic risks should use <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-containing oral contraceptives only after careful considerations of the risks, if at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
