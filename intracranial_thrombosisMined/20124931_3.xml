<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to define the relative contributions of three major pro- and anti-coagulation pathways (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-antithrombin, protein C, and tissue factor (TF)) in the thrombogenic responses that occur in large and small vessels of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was induced by topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> on the superior sagittal sinus, while photoactivation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> was used to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in cerebral microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi>, activated protein C (APC), and antibodies to either APC or TF were used to assess thrombogenesis in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant mice that overexpress the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR-tg) or with TF deficiency in Tie2-expressing endothelial cells (LTFE) were also used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation in the superior sagittal sinus of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice was attenuated by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and in EPCR-tg mice, while treatment with the APC antibodies enhanced thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was largely unresponsive to the interventions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in cerebral venules, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was inhibited by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and in EPCR-tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF antibody treatment also inhibited venular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, with a similar attenuation noted in LTFE mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thrombin promotes while the APC pathway blunts <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in an experimental model of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TF involvement is more evident in cerebral microvascular thrombogenesis, with endothelial cell-associated TF mediating this response in venules, but not arterioles </plain></SENT>
