<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study examined the growth potential and response to multimodality treatment of partially thrombosed large or giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose from nonbranching sites of the vertebral artery (VA) in 6 patients and from branching sites in 11 patients (the VA-posteroinferior cerebellar artery [PICA], 3 cases; basilar artery [BA] fenestration, 1 case; BA-superior cerebellar artery [SCA], 5 cases; and BA tip, 2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endovascular trapping was performed in 5 VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at nonbranching sites, 2 VA-PICA cases with or without revascularization of the PICA, and 1 BA fenestration case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endosaccular embolization was performed in 2 BA-SCA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as the sole treatment or after superficial temporal artery-SCA bypass for a broad-necked lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical proximal occlusion (PO) with or without revascularization of the PICA was performed in 2 VA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment failed to prevent growth in 1 VA-PICA case and the broad-necked BA-SCA case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simple flow alteration by PO of 3 BA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement on T1-weighted images, did not prevent growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum flow reduction by various combinations of bypass (superficial temporal artery-posterior cerebral artery or superficial temporal artery-SCA) and BA PO, aimed at reducing hemodynamic stress on the neck, was tailored to 5 cases, including those refractory to PO; it achieved marked shrinkage in 2 cases and stabilization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> harboring neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement nor hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed significantly lower growth potential before treatment and a lesser degree of shrinkage after tailored treatment than the remaining cases (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, marked shrinkage was achieved in 27%, moderate shrinkage in 20%, stabilization in 47%, enlargement in 7%, and favorable outcome in 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maximum flow reduction strategy for BA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> tended to show higher shrinking efficacy than endovascular trapping for VA and BA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (P = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at nonbranching sites, endovascular trapping may be effective, although its shrinking efficacy may be moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the most formidable BA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at branching sites, maximum flow reduction may cause marked shrinkage, even of aggressive lesions </plain></SENT>
