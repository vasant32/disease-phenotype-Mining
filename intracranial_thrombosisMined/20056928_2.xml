<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deciding whether to use intravenous fibrinolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> is challenging for patients, family members, and health care providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Visual displays can permit individuals to rapidly understand response patterns to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to evaluate, refine, and improve existing visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> fibrinolytic decision-making </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Existing visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> were identified by Medline search and querying of national guideline organizations, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> specialists, and were rated on a formal 8-point quality rating scale (0, lowest; 8, highest) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on available instruments, new visual displays were developed to improve informed decision-making in routine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two existing visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> were identified, one from an emergency medicine society and one from a pharmaceutical company </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both were comparison visual displays of outcomes with and without treatment; no decision matrix visual aid was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both scored 4.0 on the quality scale, showing defects of effect size distortion, privileging less salient outcomes, dissimilar representation by treatment group, and limited stakeholder participation in generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Revised versions of these graphics were developed with higher quality scores (6.75 and 7.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, a new decision matrix display with quality score 8.0 was developed that complements the numeric text of a national patient education tool developed jointly by US neurology, emergency medicine, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient organizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Existing visual <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> fibrinolysis decision-making have deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>New visual displays are now available to convey the health benefits and risks of fibrinolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy efficiently and informatively to patients and family members </plain></SENT>
