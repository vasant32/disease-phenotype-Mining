<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: It is often difficult to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), an uncommon condition that more frequently affects young subjects, is responsible for 1%-2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in adults and has a subtle clinic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in the emergency setting and to discuss the risk factors, clinical presentation, outcome and follow-up of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 40 patients with CVT admitted to the emergency department between 1996 and 2006 and examined with unenhanced CT, MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients also underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most common presenting feature (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unenhanced CT showed typical signs (cord or empty delta sign) in 11 cases and nonspecific signs in the other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was achieved with MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in 38/40 cases (95%) and with DSA in 2/40 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients died, and only one of the remaining patients developed serious disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the CT, MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-venography signs of CVT is crucial and enables an early diagnosis and timely treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DSA should be reserved for doubtful cases only </plain></SENT>
