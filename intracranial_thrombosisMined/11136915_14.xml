<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> is a proposed causal risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, but this remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations immediately after atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in the convalescent period to investigate this controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred six patients (59 men and 47 women, mean age 57.2 [25 to 70] and 56.5 [26 to 69] years, respectively) were recruited within 24 hours of admission, and 82 patients were resampled at least 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median tHcy in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not significantly higher than in matched control subjects (men 9.2 [range 4.4 to 22.8] versus 8.7 [4.9 to 20] micromol/L, P:=0.09, Mann-Whitney U: test; women 8.1 [4.8 to 32.3] versus 7.6 [3.3 to 14.4] micromol/L, P:=0.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median plasma concentrations increased significantly in the convalescent period (from 8.5 [4.8 to 19.2] to 10.1 [4.3 to 31.5] micromol/L, P:&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and were then significantly higher than in control subjects in both men and women (P:=0.03 and 0.05, respectively, Mann-Whitney U: test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This did not appear to be explained by alteration in the known covariates red-cell <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, serum B(12), or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations are not elevated after recent atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but rise in the convalescent period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data do not support the hypothesis that raised plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations predate atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Instead, they offer an explanation for the discrepancies between prospective and retrospective studies and suggest that elevated tHcy levels may be caused by the disease process itself </plain></SENT>
