<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to describe the sonographical course of the affected arteries in patients with a MRI-proven sCAD by repetitive nUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients aged&lt;60 years with 1.5 T MRI-proven sCAD were prospectively investigated by nUS, and within 48 hours after admission before MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were re-investigated after 6 months and again after a period&gt;12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-nine sCAD were detected in 37 patients; 24 lesions (49%) were located in the internal carotid arteries (ICA), and 25 (51%) in the vertebral arteries (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was found in 13 arteries (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recanalization rate of occluded arteries was 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression of stenosis/occlusion within the first 6 months was found in 34 (69%) of the affected arteries, while between 6 and &gt;12 months, the improvement rate was lower (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A complete recanalization without residual stenosis after 6 months was found in 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only one artery, initial high grade ICA stenosis progressed to complete persistent occlusion (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion caused by sCAD is highly dynamic during the first 6 month after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of arteries show regression of stenosis or recanalization of initial occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only a minority of patients experience a persistent deterioration of the vessel status </plain></SENT>
