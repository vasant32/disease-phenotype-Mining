<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate the cell proliferation process in the ischemically challenged region-at-risk after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the adult rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reversible photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model was used, which features sustained hypoperfusion followed by late spontaneous reperfusion and a remarkable morphologic tissue recovery in the anatomically well defined somatosensory cortical region-at-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve-week-old male Wistar rats received repeated intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation specific marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemistry of coronal brain sections revealed that the majority of BrdU-positive cells were of glial, macrophage, and endothelial origin, whereas 3% to 6% of the BrdU-positive cells were double-labeled by BrdU and the neuronspecific marker Map-2 at 7 and 100 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the region-at-risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were distributed randomly in cortical layers II-VI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional confocal analyses of BrdU and the neuronal-specific marker Neu N by double immunofluorescence confirmed their colocalization within the same cells at 72 hours and 30 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that, as a potential pathway for brain repair, new neurons can be generated in the cerebral cortex of adult rats after sublethal focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
