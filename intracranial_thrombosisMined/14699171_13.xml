<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted MRI at the site of venous occlusion have previously been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of these signal changes according to late venous recanalization was not determined yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a series of 28 patients with recent CVT, the frequency of hyperintense signals as seen on diffusion-weighted MRI in vein(s) or sinus(es) (HSVdwi) was assessed at the time of diagnosis, as was rate of recanalization 2 to 3 months after anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HSVdwi was detected in 20 occluded vein(s) or sinus(es) in 12 patients (41%) with recent CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean apparent diffusion coefficient measured in 5 patients within HSVdwi in the superior sagittal sinus was 4.88+/-1.49x10-4mm2/s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delay since clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was larger in the presence than in the absence of HSVdwi as detected at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No HSVdwi was visible at the second MRI although some vessels remained occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization of the vessel was less frequent when HSVdwi was observed on the first MRI (35% versus 88%, P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that the movements of water molecules are more or less restricted within the venous clot according to the stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of HSVdwi in occluded veins at the time of diagnosis might be predictive of a low rate of vessel recanalization 2 or 3 months later </plain></SENT>
