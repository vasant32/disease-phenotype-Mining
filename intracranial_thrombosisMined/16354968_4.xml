<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prenatal ultrasound (US) at 22 weeks' gestational age (GA) in a 27-year-old patient (G2 P1) revealed a nonspecific avascular echogenic mass above the cerebellum evaluated with MRI at 23 weeks' GA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With MRI an enlarged occipital pericerebral space with a layered ovoid mass at the torcular herophili was demonstrated and MRI characteristics suggested a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> cloth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In follow-up, an important enlargement of the mass was noticed on US examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After multidisciplinary consult and parental consent, a <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> induction was performed at 25 weeks' GA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baby died immediately after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> at the torcular herophili with extension into the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our case, MRI findings were helpful in diagnosing an intracranial fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
