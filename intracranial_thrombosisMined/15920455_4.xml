<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 990 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and 1124 controls were recruited from six medical centres in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of 825T carriers is significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in male subjects (OR=1.35, 95% CI, 1.01-1.82, P=0.046) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After further adjustment with traditional risk factors to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the association is not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the GNB3 825T allele is not an independent risk factor to ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
