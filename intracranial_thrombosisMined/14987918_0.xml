<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the expression of calpains and their substrates in an animal model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was induced in seven male rats by rostral and caudal ligation of the superior sagittal sinus and injection of a thrombogenic cephalin suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each animal survived 3 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a polyclonal antibody against the 80 kD subunit of micro-calpain, immunohistochemistry of the region of interest (venous infarction) showed a loss of microtubule-associated protein-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The micro-calpain-positive cells in the region of interest and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue were measured using a video-imaging microscopy unit with magnification power of 400x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A cell was considered calpain positive when the nucleus and the periplasma were stained by the micro-calpain antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was 13.4+/-3.7% of one whole coronal section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 57+/-14% of the cells were found to be calpain positive in the region of interest, whereas 5+/-2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cellular elements in unaffected tissue were calpain positive (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> causes an increase in calpain expression in affected tissue which is manifested by a loss of microtubule-associated protein-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increase might mediate secondary neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
