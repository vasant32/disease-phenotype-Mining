<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of his heart revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001718'>mitral stenosis</z:hpo> and hematological study confirmed the diagnosis of essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> (ET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 1100 ml pre-operative phlebotomy, mitral valve replacement with a 29 mm Bj√∂rk-Shiley prosthesis was performed utilizing routine cardio-pulmonary bypass using only his prestored blood and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We had no difficulty in hemostasis at the operation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As medical care was in vain, emergent distal gastrectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As we used urokinase for fear of thrombosed valve formation, residual gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was continued on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then, we began to use Gabexate-Mesilate (FOY) instead of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively, Gabexate-Mesilate was very useful drug for preventing the left atrium and prosthesis from thrombo-formation until the start of oral intake of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
