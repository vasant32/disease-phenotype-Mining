<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-w and Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax may mediate cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival via regulation of the mitochondria including second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac)/direct inhibitor of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> protein (IAP)-binding protein with low pI (DIABLO) release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to explore alterations in Bcl-w, Bcl-2, and Bax and the relationship between these proteins and Smac/DIABLO by means of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and Western blots after low- and high-intensity photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 4 h after low-intensity irradiation, we found widespread bcl-w overexpression on both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in the bilateral cortex except the ring lesion region and in subcortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prolonged elevation of Bcl-2 with relatively unchanged Bax in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fraction was demonstrated from 4 to 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These upregulated anti-apoptotic proteins combined with little Smac/DIABLO release might be associated with increased cell survival and thereby remarkable morphological recovery after low-intensity irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After high-intensity irradiation, we observed decreased bcl-w and bcl-2 mRNA with increased Bcl-2 protein in the cytosolic fraction, whereas the Bax protein remained in scattered ischaemic cells in the ring lesion and the region at risk that corresponded with release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria to the cytosol at 1-24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes might be related to the massive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> observed after high-intensity irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the balance and the location of anti-apoptotic proteins vs. pro-apoptotic proteins could be associated with the translocation of Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytosol and therefore closely related to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or survival after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
