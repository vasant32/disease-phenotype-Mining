<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to investigate the clinical presentation and predisposing factors for cerebral vein and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) in Isfahan, Iran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CVST referred to the largest tertiary-care hospital of Isfahan during a five-year period (1997 to 2001) were extracted and reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of cases with CVST diagnosed annually was 6, 9, 11, 14 and 15 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen men and 42 women were diagnosed to have CVST with the mean age of 35.1 +/- 3.8 and 28.7 +/- 1.3 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most frequent complaint (95%) and 63% of patients had focal neurological symptoms, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among possible predisposing factors, oral contraceptive pill was the most prevalent one, which was used by 38.1% of affected women for a period of as short as 1-3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anticardiolipin antibodies were detected in 14% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the annual incidence of CVST is increasing in Isfahan, perhaps due to more extensive intake of oral contraceptive pills and usage of more accurate modern diagnostic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of oral contraceptive pills was the most frequent predisposing factor; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and postpartum factors were infrequently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite other reports from the Middle East, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease is not a principal risk factor for CVST in Isfahani patients </plain></SENT>
