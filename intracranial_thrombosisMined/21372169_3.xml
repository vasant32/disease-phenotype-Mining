<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: BBA is a rare type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> that is difficult to treat both surgically and endovascularly and is often associated with a high degree of morbidity/mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to present clinical and angiographic results, as well as antiplatelet/anticoagulation regimens, of endovascular BBA treatment by using predominantly stent-assisted coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients (men/women, 6/7; mean age, 49.3 years) with ruptured BBAs were included from 2 different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings, treatment strategies, anticoagulation/antiplatelet protocols, and clinical (mRS) and angiographic outcome were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven BBAs were located in the supraclinoid ICA, and 2 on the basilar artery trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of 13 were â‰¤3 mm in the largest diameter, and 8/13 showed early growth before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary stent-assisted coiling was performed in 11/13 patients, double stents and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> in 1 patient, each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early complementary treatment was required in 3 patients, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stent-placement procedures, altered periprocedural antiplatelet (11/12) and postprocedural <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (6/12) protocols were used without evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had early rehemorrhage, including 1 major fatal SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 13 BBAs showed complete or progressive occlusion at late angiographic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical midterm outcome was good (mRS scores, 0-2) in 12/13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent-assisted coiling of ruptured BBAs is technically challenging but can be done with good midterm results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reduced periprocedural and postprocedural antiplatelet/anticoagulation protocols may be used with a low reasonable risk of thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, regrowth/rerupture remains a problem underlining the importance of early angiographic follow-up and re-treatment, including <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> if necessary </plain></SENT>
