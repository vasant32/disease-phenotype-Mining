<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1995 to 2002, 149 pediatric patients aged newborn to &lt;18 years (median 6 years) with CVT were consecutively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients and in 149 age- and gender-matched children with similar underlying clinical conditions but without CVT, the factor V G1691A mutation, the factor II G20210A variant, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)], protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, as well as associated clinical conditions, were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four (56.4%) of the patients had at least 1 prothrombotic risk factor compared with 31 control children (20.8%; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 105 (70.5%) of 149 patients with CVT presented with an underlying predisposing condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, factor V, protein C, protein S, and elevated Lp(a) were found to be significantly associated with CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in multivariate analysis, only the combination of a prothrombotic risk factor with an underlying condition (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.6), increased Lp(a) (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0 to 8.7), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> (OR 11.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 104.4) had independent associations with CVT in the children investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CVT in children is a multifactorial disease that, in the majority of cases, results from a combination of prothrombotic risk factors and/or underlying clinical condition </plain></SENT>
