<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of an incidental, nonruptured posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo>, which was successfully occluded by coil embolization after a bypass between the occipital artery and the distal posterior cerebral artery was created </plain></SENT>
