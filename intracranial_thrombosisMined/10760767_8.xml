<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are cytokines with nonoverlapping pleiotropic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prior Phase Ib study, this combination of agents exhibited antitumor effects in the lungs of four of eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted this Phase Ib/II trial to determine the response rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> treated with continuous infusion IL-2 plus GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastases</z:e> were treated with 1.5, 2.25, or 4.5 x 10(6) IU/m(2)/day 96-hour continuous infusion IL-2 on Days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18, and 1.25, 2.25, or 2.5 microg/kg/day GM-CSF on Days 8-19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were treated per protocol, 14 of whom could be evaluated for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these 14 patients had &gt;50% shrinkage of either total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153676" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pulmonary metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient developed Grade 5 neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> multifocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> subdural and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IL-2 and GM-CSF may be associated with marked morbidity and, as in one case in this study, mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant antitumor activity was appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the combination of IL-2 and GM-CSF, when administered at this dose and according to this schedule, does not appear to be active in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and is associated with significant toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies using this combination of agents should only be undertaken with extreme caution and particular attention to neurotoxicity </plain></SENT>
