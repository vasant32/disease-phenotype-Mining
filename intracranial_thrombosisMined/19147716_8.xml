<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a novel clot burden score (CBS) and collateral score (CS) are important determinants of clinical and radiologic outcomes and serve as useful additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome predictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one patients with anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> presenting within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Spearman correlation was performed to assess the correlation between CBS and CS and clinical and radiologic outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were dichotomized by using a 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Uni- and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess variables predicting favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristic and intraclass correlation coefficient (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic performance of a CBS threshold of &gt;6 was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 85 patients (mean age, 70 +/- 14.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher CBS and CS demonstrated smaller pretreatment perfusion defects and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and better clinical outcome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBS (P = .009) and recanalization (P = .015) independently predicted favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A CBS &gt;6 predicted good clinical outcome with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.84; P = .0001), sensitivity of 73.0 (95% CI, 55.9-86.2), and specificity of 64.6 (95% CI, 49.5-77.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The recanalization rate with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was higher in patients with CBS &gt;6 (P = .04; odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1-9.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.91) for CBS and CS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CBS and CS are useful additional markers predicting clinical and radiologic outcomes </plain></SENT>
