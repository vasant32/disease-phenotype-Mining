<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with deep or extensive venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a combination of treatment modalities may be required including systemic anticoagulation, selective venous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study the authors report on a patient who presented with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, a depressed level of consciousness, and a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and in whom a right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with hemorrhagic conversion was initially diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of diagnostic cerebral angiography demonstrated a patent right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and a deep venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> involving most of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite adequate systemic heparinization, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated and direct administration of alteplase into the transverse sinus in conjunction with mechanical clot disruption using a coronary AngioJet was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous flow was successfully reestablished in the deep and superficial venous sinuses by using a 0.014-in exchange wire routed from the right common femoral vein through the sinuses and out the left common femoral vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Excellent angiographic results were obtained, and the patient had recovered completely by the 7-month follow up </plain></SENT>
