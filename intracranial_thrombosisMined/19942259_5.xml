<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wondered whether clot structure/function is altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS), like in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 45 consecutive patients with AIS (24M, 21F), aged 67.4+/-10.9 years, and 45 healthy controls matched for age and sex, we investigated plasma fibrin clot structure/function by permeation, turbidity, and efficiency of fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared to controls, AIS patients produced clots that had 30.5% less porous network (p&lt;0.0001), were less susceptible to fibrinolysis (10.8% longer lysis time, p=0.001), were 20.5% more compact (p&lt;0.0001), had 17.1% higher clot mass (p&lt;0.0001), and showed increased (by 10.2%) overall fiber thickness (p&lt;0.0001) with 8% shorter lag phase of fibrin formation (p=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum rate of D-dimer release from clots was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects (n=90) showed that being a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient (p&lt;0.0001), fibrinogen (p&lt;0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) (p=0.0075) were independent predictors of clot permeability (model R2 0.79) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only fibrinogen (p&lt;0.0001) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) (p=0.0026) predicted lysis time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other fibrin parameters were predicted only by being a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clot compaction was associated with neurological deficit on admission (r=-0.81; p&lt;0.0001) and at discharge (r=-0.69; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with 0 or 1 point in the modified Rankin scale (n=19) had 13.3% higher clot permeability compared to the remainder (p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show that AIS is associated with unfavorably altered fibrin clot properties that might correlate with neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
