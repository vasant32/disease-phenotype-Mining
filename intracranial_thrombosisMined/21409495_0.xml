<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pseudoaneurysms occur at the rupture site of true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and appear as irregularly shaped and partially thrombosed outpouchings of the main sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> inside pseudoaneurysmal sac is one of the putative mechanisms of rebleeding of unsecured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and of coil migration after endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We document "real time" pseudoaneurysm formation after rerupture of an anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 55-year-old man with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from an anterior communicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> underwent catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the diagnostic angiogram while awaiting for the anesthesia team to proceed with endotracheal general anesthesia, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding was suspected and confirmed by a dynamic CT in the angio suite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A repeat angiogram showed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the previously ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> which had not been present on the original angiogram a few minutes earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Uneventful coiling of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was undertaken and the patient was discharged home a week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We document angiographic formation of a "pseudoaneurysm" at the site of rupture of an anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>. "Pseudoaneurysm" formation occurs after rupture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They represent a weak spot in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac at the site of rupture and probably the result of persistent flow within the clot forming at the site of rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Presence of a pseudoaneurysm with characteristic angiographic features like the one herein described represents an unstable area within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This case also highlights the observation that, in patient harboring unsecured ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>-like phenomena are the clinical expression of rebleeding unless proven otherwise </plain></SENT>
