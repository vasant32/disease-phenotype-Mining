<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 'n : m' matched case-control study was conducted to analyze the risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cox regression model of survival analysis was selected to deal with non-geometric proportional matched data which was difficult to analyze by logistic regression model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty-three cases together with nine hundred and twenty-five controls were interviewed with an uniformed questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis, the odds ratio and 95% CI of these risk factors appeared to be: physical labor as 1.396 (1.092-1.785); smoking as 1.551 (1.021-2.359); higher level of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as 1.354 (1.102-1.664); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> in the serum as 1.543 (1.232-1.932); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> in the serum as 1.299 (1.060-1.592); lower level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in the serum as 1.263 (1.031-1.547); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as 1.967 (1.438-2.689); diabete: 1.381 (1.139-1.675); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e>: 1.406 (1.110-1.780); <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> as 1.593 (1.307-1.943); higher SBP as 1.331 (1.129-1.569) and ApoEepsilon 4 carrier as 1.462 (1.140-1.873) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratio and 95% CI on protection factors appeared to be: reading newspaper frequently as 0.610 (0.503-0.740); frequently doing housework as 0.804 (0.665-0.973); frequently engaging in social activities as 0.617 (0.502-0.757); reemployment after formal retirement as 0.759 (0.636-0.906); having acumen olfaction as 0.900 (0.845-0.958); having extrovert personality as 0.829 (0.699-0.984); being decisive as 0.811 (0.662-0.993) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The major measures to prevent MCI seemed to be including the following factors as: being intellectuals, engaging in healthy life style and decreasing the risk in developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0868892,C0868894,C0011581,C0012706,C0868893" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">depressive disorder</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, olfactory <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>hypoesthesia</z:hpo>, cowardice and having introvert character, ApoEepsilon 4 carrier etc could be treated as early indications to signify MCI </plain></SENT>
