<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with isolated middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and tandem <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/internal carotid artery (ICA) obstruction have similar presenting symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate early recanalization of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and clinical outcomes in patients with tandem ICA/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> obstructions and isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion on pretreatment transcranial Doppler were treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICA lesions were detected with carotid duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early neurological improvement (ENI) was defined by reduction of National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) &gt; or =10 points or total NIHSS &lt; or =3 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good outcome at 3 months was a modified Rankin score of &lt; or =2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 104 patients, 31% had tandem lesions and 69% had isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization rate was 39% in isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group and 9% in tandem group (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ENI at 24 hours occurred in 46% of the isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group and in 25% of the tandem group (P=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was achieved by 30% and 39% respective patients (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The tandem lesion group showed lower early recanalization rate and ENI rate than the isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite this, good outcomes were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
