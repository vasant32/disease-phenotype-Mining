<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Radioimmunal analysis was applied to detect the serum beta-endorphin concentration in the peripheral blood of 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, aged 65.5 +/- 13, 28 age-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, and 28 sex and age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells from peripheral blood of these 3 kinds of subjects were cultured and then beta end 10(-8) g/L, beta end 10(-11) g/L, beta end 10(-14) g/L, or beta end 10(-11) g/L + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> 10(-5) g/L were added into the media respectively and the MNCs were cultured for more 24 hours (beta end 10(-8) g/L group, beta end 10(-11) g/L group, beta end 10(-14) g/L group, and beta end 10(-11) g/L + Nal group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another MNCs were cultured without addition of beta end (beta end 0 g/L group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the MNCs were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was used to detect the expressions of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-8 and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum beta-end level of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage was 129 +/- 82 ng/L, significantly lower than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (321 +/- 62 ng/L, P&lt;0.01) and that of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (264 +/- 163 ng/L, P&lt;0.05), but not significantly different from that of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the convalescent stage (160 +/- 72 ng/L, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-1beta and the expression of IL-2 of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage were significantly lower than those of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and the controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-1beta of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the convalescent stage were higher than that in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, however, the difference was not significant (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-2 of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the convalescent stage was higher than that at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-8 and the expression of iNOS of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage were significantly higher than those of the patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and the controls (both P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of IL-8 and the expression of iNOS of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the convalescent stage were significantly lower than those in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage (both P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expressions of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-8, and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the peripheral blood MNCs in vitro in the beta end 10(-8) g/L group and beta end 10(-11) g/L group were significantly higher than those of the beta end 0 g/L group, beta end 10(-11) g/L group, and beta-end 10(-11) g/L + Nal 10(-5)g/L group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The expressions of IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-8, and iNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the peripheral blood MNCs in the beta-end 10(-11) g/L +Nal 10(-5) g/L group were higher than those of the beta end 0 g/L group, however, not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The endogenous beta-endorphin level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> patients is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The immune system function is up-regulated at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and then down-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thereafter the immune system function is invariably low </plain></SENT>
