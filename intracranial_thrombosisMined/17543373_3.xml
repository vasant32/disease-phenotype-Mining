<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) have been associated with thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to DVT or PE, CVT is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a study to identify differences in thrombotic risk profile, predisposing to CVT rather than DVT or PE, particularly the contribution of oral contraception and 11 thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single center case-control study (63 CVT cases and 209 controls with DVT or PE) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of CVT patients, 11% had experienced prior DVT or PE, and none had recurrent CVT at 5 years follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVT was more frequently observed in females (79% versus 51%, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was more often secondary (75% versus 50%, P&lt;0.001), mainly due to the difference in age between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At presentation of CVT and DVT/PE, oral contraceptives were used by 78% and 74% of non-pregnant fertile women (P=0.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Any thrombophilic defect was demonstrated in 88% of CVT and 75% of DVT/PE patients (P=0.22), sex and age matched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individual and two or more defects were equally distributed among both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a majority of CVT and DVT or PE patients show single or multiple thrombophilic defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At presentation, oral contraceptive intake was observed more frequently in CVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, no differences were observed in thrombotic risk profile between both groups of comparable age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence, additional unknown risk factors should be considered to explain the different sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
