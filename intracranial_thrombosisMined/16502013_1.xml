<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclooxygenase-2 expression is regulated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> receptors, which form heterodimers with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> receptors and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> has been reported to have neuroprotective qualities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine whether the biologically active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi>-metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3</z:chebi> (1,25-D3), influences the expression of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 in photothrombotically lesioned brain or is part of an independent neuroprotective mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared groups of nonlesioned control rats and infarcted animals, which were treated with either 1,25-D3 or solvent at different times postlesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control animals, cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity was readily evident in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cortical neurons of layers II/III as well as in a few pyramidal cells in layer V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following photothrombotic infarction of the right cortical hindlimb area, there was a significant, but transient, increase in cyclooxygenase-2 labeling which was restricted to neurons of the injured hemisphere in both 1,25- D3-treated and solvent-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Highest levels of cyclooxygenase-2 immunoreactivity were seen at 12 and 24 h postlesion, followed by a gradual decrease at later time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no significant differences were detected between 1,25-D3-treated and solvent-treated lesioned rats, indicating that postischemic neuronal cyclooxygenase-2 upregulation is not influenced by 1,25-D3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the neuroprotective effect of 1,25-D3 does not depend on modulations of neuronal COX-2 expression caused by postlesional hyperexcitation </plain></SENT>
