<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children and their relationship to outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed charts of children with ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> seen at Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal between 1991 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>: 46 arterial and 5 sinovenous thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were variable and multiple in 12 (24%) of the 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> recurred in 3 (8%) patients with a single or no identified risk factor and in 5 (42%) of 12 patients with multiple risk factors (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also found 21 hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 14 (67%) of which were caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had multiple risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurred in two patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Outcome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 72 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients was as follows: asymptomatic, 36%; symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> or persistent neurologic deficit, 45%; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (40%) than in those with nonrecurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple risk factors are found in many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and may predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> tends to increase rate of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because of the high prevalence and importance of multiple risk factors, a complete investigation, including hematologic and metabolic studies and angiography, should be considered in every child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, even when a cause is known </plain></SENT>
