<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a critical event for disruption of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the MMPs, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression were reported to be significantly elevated after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate which one is more significant for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption in the photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g received focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were assessed by gelatin zymography at various times from 2 h to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> integrity was assessed using Evans blue dye with a spectrophotometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The Evans blue extravasation was increased within 2 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and was maximal at 12 and 24 h after the injury, and then gradually decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-9 protein activity was detected as early as 2 h after the focal ischemic event; it rapidly increased at 6 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and reached a maximum level 48 h after the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the MMP-9 level abruptly decreased and returned to the baseline at 72 h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the MMP-2 protein activity was up-regulated at 6 h after the focal ischemic insult, and reached a maximum level at 72 h after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The elevated MMP-2 levels persisted for 7 days after the injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The early activation of MMP-9 was correlated with the increase in the permeability of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that MMP-9 is the key factor involved in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption and subsequent brain injury after photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
