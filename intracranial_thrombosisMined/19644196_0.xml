<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through the cranial window local area of cerebral surface was irrigated by artificial CSF heated up to 41, 43 or 45 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial brain coronal sections 50 microm thick were analyzed under light microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local Cerebral Blood Flow was measured by thermo-clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood rheological properties were changed by injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">Dextran</z:chebi> T-500 and free radicals existence was controlled by DMSO injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High sensitivity of cerebral tissue to hyperthermic exposure even at a temperature of 41 degrees C has been confirmed </plain></SENT>
