<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In about 20% no risk factor is identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the clot formation by thromboelastography (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi>) in patients with a history of CVT compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> analysis was performed on recalcified blood samples of 19 CVT patients from a single centre cohort and 1:1 sex/ age (+/-3 year) matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> parameters were monitored: reaction time (r) to clot initiation, time to reach a 20 mm level of clot formation (K), slope angle alpha from r to K (alpha) and maximum vertical amplitude (MA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were tested for thrombophilic defects, including deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A mutation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, and high factor VIII levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing identified a prothrombotic abnormality in 11 patients (58%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (84%) had one or more transient risk factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> parameters between CVT patients and controls, neither between the subgroup of patients with a thrombophilic defect and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (37%), including 5 patients with abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> testing, and 5 controls (26%) had one or more <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> hypercoagulable parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> which could have predisposed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in CVT patients and in the subgroup of patients with a thrombophilic defect could not be demonstrated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44926">TEG</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
