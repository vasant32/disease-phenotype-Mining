<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report the off-label use of intraarterial eptifibatide during endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> revascularization procedures for reocclusion after documented recanalization or formed fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in distal vessels that were inaccessible to endovascular devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients who received intraarterial eptifibatide were identified from a prospectively collected database of patients in whom endovascular revascularization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was attempted between 2005 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intraarterial eptifibatide dose was a single-bolus dose of 180 μg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome measures were angiographic recanalization (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Grade 2 or 3), symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> rate, overall mortality rate, and favorable 3-month modified Rankin Scale score (≤ 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 35 patients (mean age 62 years, range 18-85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median presenting National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator before endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to therapy initiation was 230 minutes (range 90-1370 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (34%) received intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator without mechanical measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanical revascularization measures used were Merci retriever in 19 (54%), Penumbra device in 1 (3%), balloon angioplasty in 15 (43%), and stent placement in 22 (63%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean dose of intraarterial eptifibatide was 11.6 mg (range 5-16.6 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Partial-to-complete recanalization (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Grade 2 or 3) was achieved in 27 patients (77%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 13 patients (37%), causing symptoms in 5 (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the 5 symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients but one presented more than 8 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received intraarterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The median discharge National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 7 (range 0-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>At 3 months postprocedure, 21 patients (60%) had a modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2, and 8 patients (23%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive intraarterial eptifibatide is a feasible option for salvage of reocclusion and thrombolysis of distal inaccessible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> during endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Its safety and efficacy need to be studied further in larger, multicenter, controlled studies </plain></SENT>
