<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported successful repair of tetoralogy of Fallot of a male case aged 59 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no palliative operation prior to this correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative clinical features were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on effort and at rest, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001217'>clubbing</z:hpo>, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> without symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Polycytemia was remarkable at Hb 23.3 g/dl and Ht 73.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PaO2 was 39.2 mmHg and hypoxemia was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTR was 59% and pulmonary vascular shadows were decreased but bilateral pulmonary arteries were well developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization showed that high RV systolic pressure equal to that of LV and severe RV outflow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary artery was well developed (the diameter ratio of PA and aorta: 0.84) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collateral arteries to the pulmonary vascular system were not significant by aortography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures were performed under conventional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary valvular stenosis was released by comissurotomy and RV outflow tract obstruction was also released through minimal right ventriculotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The conus branch of coronary artery crossed the outflow tract, so that we preserved this artery for preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001708'>right ventricular failure</z:hpo> post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no need to use trans-annular patch for reconstruction of the outflow tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In post operative course, only a low dosage of catecholamin was required but no other special treatment was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Ventricular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005115'>supraventricular arrhythmia</z:hpo> had appeared in short period but after administration of anti arrhythmic drugs, heart rhythm was converted to sinus rhythm easily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings of RV muscle which resected at the operation showed marked fibrous degeneration and irregularity of cells, and it suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264097" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sever</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and high pressure for long time affected the ventricular muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We concluded that even older patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> were corrected safely and were able to get good quality of life after operation </plain></SENT>
