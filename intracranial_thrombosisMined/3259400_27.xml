<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because large molecular weight multimers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) have been demonstrated to cause platelet aggregation under conditions of elevated fluid shear stress as occurs in atherosclerotic vessels, we investigated his plasma vWF at the time of the event and compared it to baseline values obtained 2 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unusually large vWF multimers induced by the DDAVP infusion were present and likely contributed to the thrombotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we believe DDAVP should be given with greater caution to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
