<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about the gender-specific manifestations of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a disease that is much more common in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data of the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> (ISCVT), a multicenter prospective observational study, to analyze gender-specific differences in clinical presentation, etiology, and outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-five of a total of 624 patients were women (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Women were significantly younger, had less often a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, and had more often <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no gender differences in ancillary investigations or treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A gender-specific risk factor (oral contraceptives, pregnancy, puerperium, and hormonal replacement therapy) was present in 65% of women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women had a better prognosis than men (complete recovery 81% versus 71%l P=0.01), which was entirely due to a better outcome in female patients with gender-specific risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women without gender-specific risk factors are similar to men in clinical presentation, risk factor profile, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the absence of gender-specific risk factors is a strong and independent predictor of poor outcome in women with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR, 3.7; CI, 1.9 to 7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified important differences between women and men in presentation, course, and risk factors of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and showed that women with a gender-specific risk factor have a much better prognosis than other patients </plain></SENT>
