<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and 20 healthy subjects as controls for expression of CD11a and CD11b (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules on surface of leucocytes) were tested in vitro by flow cytometry (FCM) method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared with the control group, the patient group had significantly higher rates for expression of CD11a on monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD11b expression in the patient group was positively elevated on monocytes and granulocytes (P &lt; 0.05), but it was of lower positive rate on lymphocytes and no statistical difference was noted between the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These indicate that the expression of CD11a and CD11b on leucocytes increases in cerebral ischemic damage; thus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of leucocytes and endothelial cells obviously increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This change may aggravate post-ischemic delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
