<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor (vWF) as a marker for the endothelial system, and coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in addition to platelet functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The platelet aggregation and markers for platelet activation were monitored for the adequate inhibition of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were treated with 200 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>9 patients with 100 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> and 60-150 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, and 18 patients with 200 mg cilostazol daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow up was 8.4 +/- 3.0 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A patient was attacked by a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but no fatal vascular events occurred during the period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease was observed in the collagen- and <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-induced platelet aggregation and markers for platelet activation such as platelet factor 4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>) and beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG) by the antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the activities of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and vWF, markers for vascular damages, showed a significant decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the antiplatelet therapy could ameliorate the vascular damage through the inhibition of platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex (PIC), markers for the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, decreased significantly, suggesting that the treatment inhibits the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems induced by the platelet activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The activities of FVIII and vWF decreased significantly when the level of beta TG or that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> lowered sufficiently by the treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
