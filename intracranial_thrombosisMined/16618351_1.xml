<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the frequency of recurrence of cerebral or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and factors influencing recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients with CVT in the period 1985-2002 who were admitted to the University Hospital Gasthuisberg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed a chart review and a semi-standardized telephone interview that focused on recurrent CVT or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four CVT patients with a mean age of 42 years were followed up for a mean of 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Coagulation disorders</z:e> were found in 17 patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient (1.9%) had recurrent CVT and seven patients (12.9%) suffered systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> after a median of 2.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo> more often had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> (P = 0.04) or a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with early recurrent venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> often were not treated with oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was evident from the above study that a substantial number of patients suffer <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo> after CVT </plain></SENT>
