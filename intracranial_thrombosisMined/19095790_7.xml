<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to describe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging features, including T2*gradient-echo (GE) sequence, in presumed ICoVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examinations were performed in 8 patients with ICoVT (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and digital substraction angiography in 4) at the time of diagnosis and during the follow-up at 15 days (4 patients) and at 3 (8 patients), 6 (6 patients), 12 (3 patients), and 18 months (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the presence of a magnetic susceptibility effect (MSE) on T2*GE imaging at each site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and the presence or absence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow void and iso-, hypo-, or hyperintense signal intensity on T1, T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal signal-intensity changes were also assessed on the same sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MSE was detected on T2*GE imaging at the site of a cortical vein in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects at the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occluded vein appeared as hyperintense in 3 patients, iso- to slightly hyperintense in 1 on T1, hypointense in 6 on FLAIR images, and as signal-intensity loss on DWI in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, persisting signal-intensity abnormalities on T2*GE imaging were detected at the venous sites in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, whereas signal-intensity changes on T1- and T2-weighted images were no longer present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal hyperintensities on FLAIR and DWI (increased apparent diffusion coefficient [<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>]) were observed in close vicinity to the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 6/8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Petechial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> (n = 3) or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (n = 2) was present on T2*GE imaging in 5/8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral tissue signal-intensity changes on T1, T2, and FLAIR images decreased both in volume and intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values normalized within the tissue after 3 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
