<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent clinical trial of transcranial low-frequency ultrasound-mediated tPA thrombolysis (LFUT) showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> associated with high spatial peak pulse average intensity (I(SPPA)), wide beam and long pulse duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We developed an alternative approach to LFUT wherein diagnostic power M-mode Doppler (PMD) ultrasound is combined with LFUT, with a goal of increased safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of such a dual mode ultrasonic thrombolysis (DMUT) was explored in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DMUT system emitted PMD (2 MHz) and LFUT (550 kHz) beams in alternating fashion from a small 12 mm diameter probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LFUT had a low I(SPPA) (2 W/cm(2)) and a short pulse duration (55 micros) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusive clots made in plastic tips from bovine plasma and thrombin were placed in flow models pressurized to 800 mH(2)O, with 600 IU/mL monteplase injected upstream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization times were then compared among three groups: the control (monteplase alone), PMD (monteplase + PMD) and DMUT (monteplase + PMD + LFUT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The capability of the DMUT device to monitor recanalization was demonstrated by observing with Doppler the degree of flow of a blood-mimicking fluid in the vicinity of the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization times were 37.9 +/- 22.9, 38.9 +/- 12.4 and 18.5 +/- 8.0 min, respectively, for the control, PMD and DMUT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences between DMUT and the control (p = 0.0004) and between DMUT and PMD (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recanalization flows were clearly detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is anticipated that this DMUT method presents a safer and more efficient approach than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LFUT </plain></SENT>
