<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>)-mediated inhibition has been revealed by electrophysiological recordings associated with a diminished immunostaining of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> handling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes were found in ipsi- as well as in contralateral brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition is mediated by interneurons using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> as neurotransmitter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells use GAD (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> decarboxylase) to synthesize <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To analyze the vulnerability of GABAergic neurons in rats with a lesioned hindlimb area, cells expressing GAD65/67 mRNA were labeled using in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive somata were counted 7 and 30 days after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in different cortical (hindlimb cortex, frontal cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex) and hippocampal subsectors (pyramidal cell layer, stratum oriens and stratum radiatum/lacunosum-moleculare) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesioned hemispheres were compared with the intact brain sides and with control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GABAergic interneurons survived the injury for up to 30 days in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is unlikely that a <z:mp ids='MP_0003246'>loss of GABAergic neurons</z:mp> contributes to the reduced inhibition </plain></SENT>
