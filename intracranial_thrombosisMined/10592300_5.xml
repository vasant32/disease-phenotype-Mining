<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exposed crania of adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a ring-shaped laser-irradiation beam (o.d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>5.0 mm, 0.35 mm thick) for 2 min simultaneously with intravenous erythrosin B (17 mg/kg) infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcardial carbon-black perfusion revealed that a laser intensity of 0.90 W/cm(2) resulted in late, that is, starting at 72 h, spontaneous reperfusion, whereas the lowest laser intensity that produced lack of reperfusion at 7 days post-irradiation was 1.84 W/cm(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laser-Doppler flowmetry showed prompt cortical cerebral blood flow (cCBF) reduction both in the ring lesion and region at risk (12% and 25% of control values) after high-intensity irradiation; these reduced flow values were more rapid and pronounced than in the low-intensity irradiation setup as previously shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high- compared with low-intensity irradiation setup produced more frequent occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the ring-lesion region and a larger ischemic cortical lesion with a more rapid pace of ischemic cellular changes in the ring-lesion region and the region at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The region at risk transformed into pannecrosis in the high-intensity, but recovered morphologically in the low-intensity irradiation setup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This dual photothrombotic setup with or without spontaneous reperfusion enables the study of events related to ischemic cell survival or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in an anatomically predefined region at risk </plain></SENT>
