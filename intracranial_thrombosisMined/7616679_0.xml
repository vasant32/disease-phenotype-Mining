<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In large-sized platelets, the enzyme activity is increased, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and release potential as well as coagulability are also increased, resulting in particularly active involvement in thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This indicates that changes in the platelet count (PLT) and mean platelet volume (MPV) reflect the state of thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there have been only a relatively few reports on PLT and MPV in the elderly, although <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> frequently occurs in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we measured platelet parameters in men without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic diseases</z:e>, or <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, in order to determine changes in PLT and MPV in aged men and the effects of various factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and smoking/drinking) on these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,061 men, aged 30-83 (264 cases in their 30s, 810 cases in their 40s, 742 cases in their 50s, 209 cases in their 60s, 32 cases in their 70s and 3 cases in their 80s), were used as subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, 36 men aged 30-34 (mean age 32.6 +/- 1.2 years) and 35 men aged over 70 (mean age 73.0 +/- 3.5 years) were designated as the young and aged groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the young group, the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were significantly higher or tended to be higher in the aged group, whereas the frequency of smoking tended to be smaller in the aged group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
