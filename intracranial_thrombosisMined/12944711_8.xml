<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were selected from 2000 consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients registered in a prospective hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry in Barcelona, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A comparison of data between the nonseizure (n = 442) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (n = 10) groups was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were assessed by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> than in those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (70 vs. 19.5%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality included very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, 85 years of age or older, altered consciousness, dizziness, parietal and pons involvement, and respiratory and cardiac complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariate analysis, atherothrombotic infarction of occipital topography and decreased consciousness appeared to be independent predictors of atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> constitute an important risk factor for in-hospital mortality after atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
