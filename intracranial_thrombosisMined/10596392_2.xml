<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore we experimentally studied the effect of external contact on femoral vessels of the rat to assess its possible role in the cerebral vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major direct effect of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> fluid on the femoral vessels was vasospasm, appearing on the fourth day after instillation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasospasm was observed in 83% of femoral vessels studied between 4-15 days and one of the vessels showed intra-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in the vessel diameter after instillation (4-15 days) was compared with the controls and was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings correspond well with the observed deterioration on post-operative days 5-7, due to vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No histopathologic (light-microscopic) changes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> were found in the femoral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that contact of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> fluid to arteries leads to vasospasm, and spillage during surgical excision may contribute to vascular complications encountered in the post-operative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevention of spillage of this fluid and the routine use of cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> to prevent ischemic complications after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> surgery needs further evaluation </plain></SENT>
