<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid atherosclerotic plaque rupture is thought to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological hallmarks of these plaques have been identified through observational studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although generally accepted, the relationship between cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and in situ atherosclerotic plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> has never been directly observed noninvasively in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive acutely symptomatic patients referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protocol magnetic resonance imaging/angiography underwent additional T1- and T2-weighted carotid bifurcation imaging with the use of a 3-dimensional technique with blood signal suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two blinded reviewers performed plaque gradings according to the American Heart Association classification system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Discharge outcomes and brain magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Image quality for plaque characterization was adequate in 86 of 106 patients (81%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/IS patients with noncarotid pathogenesis were excluded, yielding 78 study patients (38 men and 40 women with a mean age of 64.3 years, SD 14.7) with 156 paired watershed vessel/cerebral hemisphere observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients had 40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/IS events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association between type VI plaque (demonstrating cap rupture, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/IS (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression model including standard Framingham risk factors and type VI plaque was constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Type VI plaque was the dominant outcome-associated observation achieving significance (P&lt;0.0001; odds ratio, 11.66; 95% confidence interval, 5.31 to 25.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In situ type VI carotid bifurcation region plaque identified by magnetic resonance imaging is associated with ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/IS as an independent identifier of events, thereby supporting the dominant disease pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
