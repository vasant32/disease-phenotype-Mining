<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA) has been used to image the development of an ischemic core following photochemically induced infarction in rats up to 1 h post-lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using LASCA, we have been able to image a central ischemic core which had little or no perfusion surrounded by a penumbral region with reduced perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have shown the existence of a surrounding region of hyperemic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A potential feature of this imaging approach is its capability to track cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the region within and outside the ischemic core besides demonstrating the real-time progression of the ischemic core into the penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated the continuous disruption of CBF to the ischemic core that eventually affected the blood supply to the surrounding regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The penumbral flow is shown to exhibit a sudden increase post-ischemic induction followed by a slow decline to the final baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we observed an interaction (P &lt; 0.03) between penumbral flow peak and the time effects of increase in pixel area from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region to the surrounding penumbral region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a paired-sample t test, we observed that the mean pixel area was larger for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region than for the penumbral region (P &lt; 0.004) during the time interval between the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the time point of peak flow in the penumbral region </plain></SENT>
