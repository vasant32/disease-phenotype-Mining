<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a 34-year-old woman who developed severe CVT with mental symptoms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> with central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aggressive medical therapies including unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, a mixture of concentrated glycerin and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>, and intravenous administration of thiamazole, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31709">iohexol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with plasma exchange (PE) two times, in addition to aggressive medical therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neurologic symptoms and laboratory data including high levels of thyroid hormones began to improve soon after the first PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged after PE although the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> dose was not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 6 months, her modified Rankin Scale score was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PE should be considered for severe CVT as a result of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e>, because it not only reduces thyroid hormones, but also might remove multiple prothrombotic factors </plain></SENT>
