<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty-four consecutive intraarterial thrombolysis candidates underwent noncontrast CT followed immediately by CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Axial source and two-dimensional collapsed maximum intensity projection reformatted CTA images were rated for the presence or absence of large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five hundred seventy-two circle-of-Willis vessels were reviewed; arteriographic correlation was available for 224 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of large vessel occlusion were 98.4 and 98.1%; accuracy, calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis, was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean time for acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis of CTA images was approximately 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA is highly accurate for the detection and exclusion of large vessel intracranial occlusion and may therefore be valuable in the rapid triage of hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients to intraarterial thrombolytic treatment </plain></SENT>
