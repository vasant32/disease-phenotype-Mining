<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient had undergone lumbar puncture at varying times prior to clinical presentation (4 days to over 1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only two of the patients had received intravenous (i.v.) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> 48 h prior to CVT and were under oral contraception, a risk factor for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other two patients had not undergone recent lumbar puncture, were not taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and did not present vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> routine blood work-ups and none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients dramatically improved with full systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Minor sequelae were noticed in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis underlying the occurrence of CVT in MS patients remains unclear and we discuss the relationship between lumbar puncture, steroid treatment and CVT </plain></SENT>
