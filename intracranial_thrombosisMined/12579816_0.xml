<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the effect of 3,4-oxo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29858">isopropylidene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16119">shikimic acid</z:chebi> (ISA) against arteriovenous shunt and middle cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (MCAT) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Arteriovenous shunt model was adopted to measure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight; The neurologic deficit (ND) and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size (IS) of the middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (MCAT) model induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> were observed; The effect of ISA on platelet aggregation rate of rat and rabbit by giving ISA in vivo and in vitro was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ISA 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg.kg-1 ig was shown to reduced the weight of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in arteriovenous shunt model; ISA 50, 100 and 200 mg.kg-1 ig for 2 times in 24 hours, attenuated the ND of rats subjected to MCAT; ISA 100 and 200 mg.kg-1 reduced IS of rats after MCAT by 27.8% and 31.6%, respectively; ISA 50, 100 and 200 mg.kg-1 ig inhibited platelet aggregation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats; ISA 10(-3)-10(-5) mol.L-1, inhibited rabbit platelet aggregation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ISA inhibited <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by anti-platelet-aggregation </plain></SENT>
