<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this 15-year Danish historical cohort study, we followed nonpregnant women, 15 to 49 years old, with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data on use of hormonal contraception, clinical end points, and potential confounders were obtained from four national registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,626,158 women contributed 14,251,063 person-years of observation, during which 3311 thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (21.4 per 100,000 person-years) and 1725 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (10.1 per 100,000 person-years) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared with nonuse, current use of oral contraceptives that included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> at a dose of 30 to 40 μg was associated with the following relative risks (and 95% confidence intervals) for thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> type: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7627">norethindrone</z:chebi>, 2.2 (1.5 to 3.2) and 2.3 (1.3 to 3.9); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi>, 1.7 (1.4 to 2.0) and 2.0 (1.6 to 2.5); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>, 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9) and 1.3 (0.9 to 1.9); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>, 2.2 (1.8 to 2.7) and 2.1 (1.5 to 2.8); gestodene, 1.8 (1.6 to 2.0) and 1.9 (1.6 to 2.3); and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50838">drospirenone</z:chebi>, 1.6 (1.2 to 2.2) and 1.7 (1.0 to 2.6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> at a dose of 20 μg, the corresponding relative risks according to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> type were as follows: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi>, 1.5 (1.3 to 1.9) and 1.6 (1.1 to 2.1); gestodene, 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1) and 1.2 (0.8 to 1.9); and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50838">drospirenone</z:chebi>, 0.9 (0.2 to 3.5) and 0.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For transdermal patches, the corresponding relative risks were 3.2 (0.8 to 12.6) and 0.0, and for a vaginal ring, 2.5 (1.4 to 4.4) and 2.1 (0.7 to 6.5) </plain></SENT>
