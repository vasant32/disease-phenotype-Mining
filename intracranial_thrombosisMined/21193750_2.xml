<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against annexin A2 (anti-A2Ab) coincide with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e>, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> (aPLA) are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in any vascular bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Annexin A2, a profibrinolytic receptor and binding site for Î²2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I, the main target for aPLA, is highly expressed on cerebral endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluate the prevalence of anti-A2Ab in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty individuals with objectively documented CVT (33 women and 7 men) and 145 healthy controls were prospectively studied for hereditary and acquired prothrombotic risk factors, classical aPLA, and anti-A2Ab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One or more prothrombotic risk factors were found in 85% of CVT subjects, (pregnancy/puerperium in 57.5%, classical aPLA in 22.5%, and hereditary procoagulant risk factors in 17.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-A2Ab (titer &gt;3 SD) were significantly more prevalent in patients with CVT (12.5%) than in healthy individuals (2.1%, P&lt;0.01, OR, 5.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-A2Ab are significantly associated with CVT and may define a subset of individuals with immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
