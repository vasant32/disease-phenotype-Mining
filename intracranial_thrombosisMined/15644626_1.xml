<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information regarding race-ethnic differences in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 50 CVT patients from Brazil, comparing clinical and laboratory data among white (W) and African-Brazilian (AB) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy percent of the patients were female, 26 W and 23 AB, mean age 34.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple sinus CVT, deep CVT and worse outcome were significantly more frequent in AB than in W patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a trend towards a higher frequency of factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutation in W than in AB, and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> in AB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CVT was more severe in AB patients than in W patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Race-ethnic differences may account for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> distribution of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in this series </plain></SENT>
