<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To induce targeted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> we describe a simple adaptation of a commercial upright Olympus BX51WI microscope, permitting light from a 532 nm laser to be directed into the back aperture of a high numerical aperture fluorescence objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The system involves using a filter slot available on an Olympus BX series microscope to direct a collimated laser beam through the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> epifluorescence path to the objective back aperture resulting in focused photoactivation, with lateral and axial dimensions less than 3 and 5 microm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Existing fluorescence filters and dichroic mirrors are employed permitting one to safely target the green laser beam and view the clotting process based as red epifluorescence, either through the eye pieces or using a CCD camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interruption in blood flow can be confirmed using laser speckle microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positioning of the photothrombotic laser in this manner does not impede subsequent analysis of brain microcirculation using two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy or other imaging methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that this modification and laser system can also be used for other scenarios where targeted photoactivation or photobleaching would be required </plain></SENT>
