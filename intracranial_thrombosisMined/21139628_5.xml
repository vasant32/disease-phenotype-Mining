<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we addressed this issue using a <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI)-induced thrombotic model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in adult mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 6, 15, and 24 â€‰hours after injury, animals were divided into three groups for (1) in vivo T2- and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, followed by histochemistry, (2) ex vivo DTI and electron microscopy, and (3) additional biochemical or immunochemical assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temporal changes of diffusion anisotropy and histopathology were compared in the fimbria, internal capsule, and external capsule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that HI caused a rapid reduction of axial and radial diffusivities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three axonal bundles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A large decrease in fractional anisotropy, but not in axial diffusivity per se, was associated with structural breakdown of axons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the decrease in radial diffusivity correlated with swelling of myelin sheaths and compression of the axoplasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gray matter of the hippocampus also exhibited a high level of diffusion anisotropy, and its reduction signified dendritic degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that cross-evaluation of multiple DTI parameters may provide a fuller picture of axonal and dendritic injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
