<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a British heat wave with little or no distortion due to air-conditioning, outside temperatures of 34.6 degrees C (maximum) and 20.8 degrees C (minimum) were followed by peak mortalities from coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> one to two days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experimental exposure of volunteers to moving air at 41 degrees C for six hours caused core temperature to rise 0.84 degree C, weight to fall 1.83 kg with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> despite access to water, heart rate to increase 32 beats per minute, and arterial pressure to fall, particularly on standing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The red blood cell count increased 9 percent, and blood viscosity increased 24 percent, mostly after the first hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The platelet count rose 18 percent, and the platelet volume fell, mostly in the first hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The plasma cholesterol level increased 14 percent without a change in distribution among <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes seem able to explain the increased mortality from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in hot weather </plain></SENT>
