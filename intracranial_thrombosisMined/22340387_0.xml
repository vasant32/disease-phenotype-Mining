<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have demonstrated a relatively low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among young women, though both pregnancy and delivery can substantially increase the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> may manifest different characteristics during pregnancy and postpartum as a result of their specific physiological statuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to identify the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy and postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> who were assigned to either group A (during pregnancy) or group B (during postpartum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relevant risk factors, initiation and development of the disease, clinical presentations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis were compared between the two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> occurred during both pregnancy and postpartum, but was more common postpartum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in group A had a longer hospitalization period than those in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Confirmed predisposing factors in 85.7% of patients of group A were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and underlying cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No obvious predisposing factors were identified in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptom was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, hemiparalysis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> being less frequent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Focal neurological symptoms (P = 0.022) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (P = 0.014) occurred more frequently in group A than in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy proved to be safe for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> patients during puerperium, regardless of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, more attention should be paid to spontaneous in-site placental <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in pregnant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both groups had similar prognoses (P = 1.000), with 36.3% patients suffering from consequential dysfunction or recurrent intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Delayed diagnosis was associated with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> manifests different clinical characteristics during pregnancy and postpartum, though both have a good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and prompt anticoagulation therapy are essential </plain></SENT>
