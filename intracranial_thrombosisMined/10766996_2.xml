<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present pregnancy was successfully managed with intravenous administration of AT III (6,000-8,000 U/wk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) for exons 3A and 4 of the AT III gene (AT3) using her DNA revealed extra expansion bands with altered migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The DNA sequencing demonstrated novel mutations in exon 3A of AT3: a G to T substitution at nucleotide position 5333 in codon GAG for Glu 113, causing a stop codon (E113X), and an A to T substitution at position 5338 in codon AAA for Lys 114, forming Asn (K114N) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These novel mutations, especially E113X, in AT3 may be related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> in the pregnancy </plain></SENT>
