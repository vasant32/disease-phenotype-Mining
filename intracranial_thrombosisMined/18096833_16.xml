<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx-3) is a major <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme in plasma and the extracellular space that scavenges reactive oxygen species produced during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> metabolism or after oxidative insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A deficiency of this enzyme increases extracellular oxidant stress, promotes platelet activation, and may promote oxidative posttranslational modification of fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently identified a haplotype (H(2)) in the GPx-3 gene promoter that increases the risk of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> among children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The aim of this study is to identify possible relationships between promoter haplotypes in the GPx-3 gene and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the GPx-3 gene promoter from 23 patients with CVT and 123 young controls (18 to 45 years) by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and sequencing analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over half of CVT patients (52.1%) were heterozygous (H(1)H(2)) or homozygous (H(2)H(2)) carriers of the H(2) haplotype compared with 12.2% of controls, yielding a more than 10-fold independent increase in the risk of CVT (OR=10.7; 95% CI, 2.70 to 42.36; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among women, the interaction of the H(2) haplotype with hormonal risk factors increased the OR of CVT to almost 70 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a novel GPx-3 promoter haplotype is a strong, independent risk factor for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As we have previously shown that this haplotype is associated with a reduction in transcriptional activity, which compromises <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity and antithrombotic benefits of the enzyme, these results suggest that a deficiency of GPx-3 leads to a cerebral venous thrombophilic state </plain></SENT>
