<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a recognized association between pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e> (IBD) and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (CTEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Historical reporting had described the association as strongest between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (UC), rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the incidence and outcome of CTE in pediatric IBD patients from a single center over 5 years and the relative proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reported in the literature in patients with UC and CD before and after January 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic data were extracted on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> newly diagnosed cases of IBD in our center from January 2003 to January 2008 to ascertain patient characteristics, disease type, risk factors for CTE, modality of neuroimaging, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A literature search was performed to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> articles describing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in pediatric IBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> identified studies were stratified into those published before and after January 1 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 154 new patients diagnosed with IBD (male 56%) (UC 30%, CD 64%, IBD unclassified [IBDU] 6%) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four cases of CTE occurred in our population over 5 years (2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a risk factor for CTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen case series were identified with 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the proportion <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> affecting patients with CD reported after January 2000 (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTE affects a proportion of pediatric IBD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although resolution of physical impairment is the norm, significant morbidity exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our study suggests a secular trend toward CTE in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Primary prevention with the identification and amelioration of identifiable risk factors should be the clinical objective in future studies </plain></SENT>
