<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For determining risk factors, we retrospectively analysed hemostatic markers in 19 pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who were treated with either 1 of the 2 L-asparaginase-containing regimens; 11 were treated with VLP1 and the remaining 8 were treated with the VLAD protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data indicated that low coagulation factors in association with increased plasma D-dimer levels during or post-L-asparaginase administration combined with fresh frozen plasma infusion might have activated coagulation processes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Careful management is required to prevent such episodes in patients with markedly decreased coagulation factors and increased D-dimer levels following L-asparaginase administration </plain></SENT>
