<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hyperacute surgical evacuation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> is associated with a high rebleeding rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The peri-operative administration of rFVIIa to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> may decrease the frequency of post-operative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and improve outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients receiving recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIA) therapy immediately prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> surgery were collected at two centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) score and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> Grading Scale were determined, as was long-term outcome using the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residual/recurrent clot was evaluated by comparing pre-operative to post-operative CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> received 40-90 microg/kg of rFVIIa and underwent surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> evacuation at a median time of five hours following symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median pre-operative clot volume was 60 ml, decreasing to 2 ml post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no thromboembolic adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients survived, 11 (73%) were independent, and two (13%) had a moderate to severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These outcomes were significantly better than expected based on the median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> score (40% mortality) and based on median <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> Grading Scale (18% good outcome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The pre or perioperative administration of rFVIIa resulted in minimal residual or recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> volume and may be an important adjunct to surgery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
