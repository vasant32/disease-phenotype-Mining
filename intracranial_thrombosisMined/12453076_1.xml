<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are currently no data on whether high total serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) is predictive for cerebrovascular events in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether high tHcy levels were related to the evidence of non-fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence of non-fatal atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events was verified in 450 consecutive male patients, admitted for inpatient treatment of symptomatic PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was evaluated by colour duplex Doppler measurement and fasting tHcy was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within the population of 450 PAD patients a documented history of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was evident in 50 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median tHcy values were significantly higher in PAD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (18.6 micromol/l) than in PAD patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (15.1 micromol/l, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analysis revealed that tHcy was an independent and significant predictor (P=0.001) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.37 for an increment of 5 micromol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this multivariate model, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR=2.34, P=0.011) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> &gt; or =50% (OR=2.59, P=0.005) were also independently related to clinical cerebrovascular disease in PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates an association of tHcy and evidence of non-fatal atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic PAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could be important, as a reduction of elevated tHcy concentrations by vitamin supplement might decrease the high frequency of cerebrovascular complications in PAD patients </plain></SENT>
