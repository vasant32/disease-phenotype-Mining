<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Protein Z (PZ), a vitamin Kdependent protein, plays a role in inhibiting coagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its plasma level or PZ gene polymorphisms have been discussed as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with conflicting results reported between various studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only one of these polymorphisms was studied in a cohort of patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective genetic study comparing 100 healthy controls to 54 patients referred to our hemostasis unit after CVT occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the distribution of three PZ gene polymorphisms that may influence PZ plasma levels: A-13G in the promoter and G79A in intron F were tested using previously described techniques, and we developed a technique to evaluate the G-103A in intron A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The G79A polymorphism was significantly more frequent in patients than in controls (p = 0.012): the presence of at least one A allele led to an odds ratio of 2.57 with a 95 % confidence interval of 1.23-5.34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The A-13G polymorphism also showed a nonsignificant trend towards a higher prevalence in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The G79A polymorphism of the PZ gene was shown to be a new independent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these results have to be confirmed by a prospective study including plasma PZ evaluation </plain></SENT>
