<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between long-term prognosis of functional status after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings as well as complications in the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 98 patients with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were enrolled, and 65 patients surviving 5 years after the event, were studied in terms of cognitive function and activity of daily living (ADL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age at registration (3 months after the event) was 72.0 years-old and 44 were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI findings were divided into eight categories including the size and laterality of infarction, in addition to six categories as previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was identified according to the HDS-R and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R scales, and the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, assessed with the CDR scale, was divided into 3 grades: none, mild, and severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of ADL status was also graded into 3 classes: independent, partially dependent, and completely dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e> (hip joint fracture) were counted as complications during the course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was identified in 44, consisting of 30 mild and 14 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During 5 years, 11 cases with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> showed deterioration, and 1 case without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> developed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At registration, there were 46 cases with partially dependent ADL status and 22 cases completely dependent, while deterioration of ADL was seen in 17 during 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analyses showed that diffuse PVH and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> were contributory factors to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e> were risk factors for deterioration of ADL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, especially in patients with diffuse PVH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e> should be taken care of in order to prevent functional decline </plain></SENT>
