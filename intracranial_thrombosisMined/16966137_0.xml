<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The paper describes these new therapeutic devices designed for the minimally invasive approach to vascular thromboloysis, selective dissection of tissues, and drug or DNA delivery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the response of cells to shock loading, a precise method of shock waves generation in space and time has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method has been studied for application in cardiovascular therapy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment, and cranioplasty in close vicinity of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A laser ablation shock wave assisted particle acceleration device has been developed for delivering drug and DNA into soft targets in the human body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The penetration depth of microparticles observed in the experimental targets is believed to be sufficient for pharmacological treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In order to achieve an efficient method for rapid revascularization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, a laser induced liquid jet (LILJ) system has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The LILJ has been successfully applied for selective dissection of soft tissue preserving nerve and blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The system has been further improved by using piezoelectric actuators to drive the liquid jets, as an alternative to pulse laser </plain></SENT>
