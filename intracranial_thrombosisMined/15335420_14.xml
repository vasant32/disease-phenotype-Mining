<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Thrombolytic agents have been administered through external ventricular drains to treat <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, the goals being to accelerate clot clearance, prevent catheter obstruction, and help control intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared these variables in a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients treated by one surgeon who routinely used intraventricular recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for obstructive hematocephalus with those in a group of similar patients treated by other surgeons who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients included in this analysis were those with repaired <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> causing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into at least three ventricles with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo> requiring external ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ventricular system was considered "opened" when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ventricles were patent and reduced in size on computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those treated with rt-PA received 4 mg/d through a ventricular drain until ventricular opening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean number of days to ventricular opening was 3.9 (standard deviation [SD], 1.0) for the 21 patients treated with rt-PA and 7.1 (SD, 3.7) for the 9 who were not (P = 0.001), and the mean intracranial pressure (mm Hg) 24 hours after treatment with rt-PA was 10.4 (SD, 6.1) compared with 14.1 (SD, 5.9) during the same interval for the group that did not receive rt-PA (P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular catheter replacement was required in 1 rt-PA patient (for a misplaced catheter, before rt-PA treatment) and 3 patients who did not receive rt-PA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> for catheter obstructions with blood clot) (P = 0.07), and ventriculoperitoneal shunts were placed in 4 rt-PA patients and 3 patients who did not receive rt-PA (P = 0.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraventricular thrombolysis with rt-PA seems to assist in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management of patients with large aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhages</z:mp>, speeding clearance of aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, normalizing intracranial pressure, and reducing ventricular catheter obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial is needed to confirm these findings, establish treatment safety, and determine whether treatment affects outcome </plain></SENT>
