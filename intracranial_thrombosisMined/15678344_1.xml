<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 72-year-old patient was referred to the neuroradiological department for diagnostic angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging performed elsewhere had demonstrated a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar artery tip 2 cm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000475'>broad neck</z:hpo> that was partially thrombosed, which precluded closure by coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgical management by clipping also appeared to be unsuitable because of the proximity to the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decision was reached to proceed expectantly by closely monitoring the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> increased in size in the ensuing weeks, coiling was performed successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up showed reperfusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck and closure was again achieved by repeat coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion is not a rare complication following coiling and often necessitates renewed intervention </plain></SENT>
