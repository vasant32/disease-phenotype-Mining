<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the effect of the novel plasminogen activator (SUN9216), a plasminogen-plasminogen activator chimera, comprising the fibrin kringle 1 domain of a plasminogen, and the two kringles, and the serine protease domains of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), including a modification of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi> glycosylation site on the kringle 1 of t-PA (PK1de1FE1X), was studied in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the newly described model of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occurred usually within 8 min in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> as a consequence of an endothelial injury subsequent to a photochemical reaction between a systemically administered photosensitive dye (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>) and a transillumination of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with a high-intensity green light with a wavelength of 540 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was quantitated by means of pathological examination of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was observed in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> using electron microscopical analysis based on ion beam bombardment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 hr after induction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, the brain was removed from 13 control animals, nine coronal sections were stained from each brain with triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC), and the ischemic area was quantitated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A constant area of infarction was observed in the cortex and the lateral part of the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a second group (n = 8), at 1 or 8 weeks after induction of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, the coronal sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
