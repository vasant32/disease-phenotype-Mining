<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The subjects who died in the Sicilian municipality of Riposto between 1985 and 1992, and whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates reported diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease, were re-evaluated with the aim of verifying the reliability of the certificates themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relatives of the deceased were interviewed to confirm or exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and about 35% of the cases proved to be false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the causes reported on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>", "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>" and "<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>" presented the smallest number of false positives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the sensitivity and specificity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates was poor, and there would also seem to be a large number of false negatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the official mortality rates for cerebrovascular disease are probably not very far from the truth </plain></SENT>
