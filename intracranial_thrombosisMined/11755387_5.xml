<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the last two decades several studies have suggested the role of photothrombotic occlusion of cerebral microvessels using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>, resulting in small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in rodents that resemble those in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes such a photothrombotic method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction in rats with histopathologic and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) observations from 3 to 6 h after irradiation, which is homologous to a human autopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Utilizing 30 min of irradiation with minimal beam intensity (0.1 W/cm(2)) cold white light in conjunction with 20 mg of intravenous (iv) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> as a rapid infusion, small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were induced photochemically in the frontal lobes of six rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> showed a consistent pattern on histologic and in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sections when examined within 7 h or less of irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both MRI and histologic sections were comprised of (a) a superior zone of infarcted neurons, (b) a middle curvilinear transition zone of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> on MRI and histologically vacuolated neuropil, and (c) an inferior zone of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shorter duration water-sensitive (T2)- and postgadolinium longer duration (T1)-weighted signal decay images both showed a curvilinear hyperintense transition zone of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and transition zone areas measured from the histologic sections were comparable to those measured on the MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> model described above allows in vivo observations using MRI with the potential for use in testing putative neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated by a comparison with the histologic features of such <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in surgical and autopsy brain specimens, the model is relevant to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> human ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
