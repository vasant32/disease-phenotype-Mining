<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurotoxic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> is usually detoxified by the constitutive <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-2 (HO-2) and its inducible isoform HO-1(heat shock protein 32) resulting in the formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> which becomes reduced to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> (CO), and iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">Biliverdin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> have antioxidative properties whereas CO is discussed as a signaling molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Iron if it remains free could catalyze Haber--Weiss and Fenton reactions causing the formation of highly toxic radicals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have studied the alterations of cerebral HO-2 and HO-1 in relation to iron accumulations after defined cortical photothrombosis within the hindlimb area of the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HO-2 immunohistochemistry showed that the number of HO-2-positive neurons in most perilesional regions remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, much stronger systemic immunoreactivity for HO-2 was observed between days 1 and 7 postlesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For HO-1 a systemic increase of immunoreactivity occurred also between days 1 and 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition HO-1-positive astrocytes and microglia appeared as early as 4 h postlesion and increased up to day 3 followed by a sharp decline toward day 14 within the injured hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HO-1-positive astrocytes and microglia occurred in ipsilateral cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally an increase of HO-1 in myelin-associated globulin-positive oligodendrocytes was found in ipsilateral and contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Next to the lesion iron accumulation occurred after day 3 and increased strongly toward day 14 at times when HO-1 and -2 had decreased, suggesting that HO activity does not directly contribute to postlesional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
