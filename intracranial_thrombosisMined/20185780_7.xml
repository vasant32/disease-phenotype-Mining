<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) patients, emergency decompressive surgery has been suggested as a life-saving procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 12 patients with malignant CVT, among whom 8 underwent operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study of 12 patients from 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> units who had a malignant CVT as defined: (1) supratentorial cortical lesions attributable to superficial venous system <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with or without sinus involvement; (2) with clinical (decreased consciousness and <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp>) or radiological signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393985" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transtentorial herniation</z:e>; (3) either at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> or after worsening despite <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery or abstention was decided individually by neurosurgeons on call </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 9 women and 3 men with a mean age of 45+/-15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delay between <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy and signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> ranged from 2 to 30 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At malignant worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient had hemorrhagic lesions; the median deviation of septum pellucidum was 12 mm (interquartile range, 6.7-13); 5 patients (including 3 who underwent operation) had a unilateral dilated pupil; and 4 (2 who underwent operation) had bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent surgical decompression, external decompression in 4, both external and internal decompression in 3, and internal decompression in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 4 patients who did not undergo operation died within 1 to 5 days after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient who underwent operation died of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 7 others survived, with, at last follow-up (median, 23.1 months; interquartile range, 19.7-45.6), an excellent recovery of mRS 0 or 1 in 6 and mRS 3 in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decompressive surgery may save lives and may even allow a good functional outcome in malignant CVT, even in patients with bilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
