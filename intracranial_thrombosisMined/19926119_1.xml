<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between methylenotetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677TT and the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of this polymorphism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) are inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: With a systematic review, we aimed to collect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case-control studies comparing the frequency of this polymorphism in CVT patients (cases) and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and the ISI web of knowledge electronic databases and reference lists of retrieved articles in order to identify published case-control studies that evaluated the presence of MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers independently selected studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the frequency of 677TT between cases and controls using the Mantel-Haenszel method, a fixed and a random-effects model in the pooled data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine case-control studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pooled analysis included 382 patients with CVT and 1217 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of 677TT genotype among CVT patients was not significantly higher compared with controls (15.7% versus 14.6%; OR=1.12, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.80 to 1.58; p=0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirmed that there is currently insufficient data supporting that 677TT genotype is a risk factor for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results imply a continuing searching for the cause of CVT in patients with this polymorphism </plain></SENT>
