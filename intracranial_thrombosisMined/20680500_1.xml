<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> represents a rare type of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a mortality rate of 80%-90% if not promptly treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to review our experience with computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and its treatment with endovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study is based upon 59 nontrauma patients with episodes of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were investigated using unenhanced brain CT followed by intracranial CTA (16-slice CT) when no parenchymal haemorrhage was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a CTA diagnosis of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were considered for endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTA accuracy was evaluated by considering the 12 patients who underwent endovascular angiography (the gold standard) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The success of endovascular therapy was evaluated by considering the degree of microcirculatory reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the exclusion of 33 patients affected by parenchymal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, the final study consisted of 26 patients who underwent CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed in 15 of them, and 12 were treated at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The comparison between CTA and endovascular angiography showed 100% agreement in evaluating occlusion site and extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent intra-arterial lysis, and five underwent mechanical clot removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CTA, with its wide availability and rapid execution times, is the most indicated examination in the case of suspected basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although there is a lack of randomised controlled prospective studies suggesting the most appropriate therapeutic approach to basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, our study lends weight to the role of interventional neuroradiology in the treatment of this condition </plain></SENT>
