<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the systemic mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the relationship between airway and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and pial cerebral venular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 24h after intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of diesel exhaust particles (DEP; 15 or 30 microg/mouse) or saline (control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses of 15 and 30 microg/mouse induced a dose-dependent macrophage and neutrophil influx into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid with elevation of total proteins and Trolox equivalent <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> capacity (TEAC), but without IL-6 release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in plasma, IL-6 concentrations did not increase but the TEAC was significantly and dose-dependently decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of platelets and the tail <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time were both significantly reduced after exposure to DEP (30 microg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the same dose showed platelet proaggregatory effect in mouse pial cerebral venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with the cysteine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi> (OTC, 80 mg/kg) 24 and 1h before i.t </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DEP (30 microg), abolished the DEP-induced macrophage and neutrophil influx, and the increase of TEAC in BAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lung histopathology confirmed the protective effect of OTC on DEP-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001861'>lung inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OTC also reversed the decrease of TEAC concentrations in plasma, the shortening of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, and the thrombotic effect of DEP in pial cerebral venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pulmonary exposure to DEP cause <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> responsible, at least partially, for the pulmonary and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and thrombotic events in the pial cerebral microvessels of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OTC pretreatment abrogated these effects through its ability to balance oxidant-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status </plain></SENT>
