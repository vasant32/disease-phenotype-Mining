<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective case series, the raw data of nonenhanced CT scans from 54 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and proven vascular obliteration of the middle cerebral artery were collected along with the same data from patients not having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but the same sex and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> raw data were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 5 mm and as thin slices with a thickness of 0.625 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three observers independently evaluated the 5-mm nonenhanced CT reconstructions and 5-mm maximum intensity projections of the thin slices and rated the likelihood of a clot obliterating the middle cerebral artery trunk or first-order branches using a 5-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were evaluated in comparison with base data using receiver operating curve analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was measured using Cohen κ for every pair of observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The area under the curve for the receiver operating curve analysis for the thick slices ranged from 0.63 to 0.67, whereas for the maximum intensity projection images of the thin slice reconstructions, receiver operating curve analysis revealed areas under the curve between 0.94 and 0.97 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interobserver agreement was higher for thin-slice (κ, 0.69-0.83) versus thick-slice nonenhanced CT reconstructions (κ, 0.38-0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thin-slice reconstructions of standard cranial nonenhanced CT raw data allow for more sensitive and reliable detection of clots occluding the proximal middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
