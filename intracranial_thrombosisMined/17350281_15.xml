<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes are major components of the glial scar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They are interconnected by gap junctions, with connexin43 (Cx43) being the most prominent channel protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We applied a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> to study the spatio-temporal expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, as well as of Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in gliotic tissue up to 60 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactive astrocytes enveloping the lesion up-regulated their Cx43 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A band of reactive astrocytes filling in the lesion exhibited elevated Cx43 and showed a high degree of proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of these findings, we hypothesize a role for Cx43 in glial scar formation, specifically in the proliferation of astrocytes </plain></SENT>
