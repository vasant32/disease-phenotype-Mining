<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In recent studies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, older age, and infectious origin have been identified as prognostic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no studies of the prognosis of CVT have evaluated hemodynamic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is conceivable that the presence or absence and the efficiency of venous collaterals, as well as recanalization, may have an impact on brain tissue damage and hence on the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVT (mean age, 40+/-15 years) were recruited prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, followed by oral anticoagulation for 12 months, except for 2 patients who were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were graded on the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale on admission, at hospital discharge, and at 90+/-14 days after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The functional clinical outcome was graded on the modified Rankin Scale on day 90 after admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received a venous transcranial duplex sonography (TCCS) on admission and were followed up in case of a pathological result until normalization was recorded (mean follow-up, 316+/-395 days; range, 13 to 1180 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Initial TCCS was pathological in 18 of 26 patients (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four distinct venous drainage types were identified: increased drainage to the cavernous sinus and to the deep cerebral veins, flow reversal in the basal veins, and either compensatory increased or reversed flow in the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> venous TCCS or normalized TCCS within 90 days was significantly related to favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCCS can be used to evaluate venous drainage patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and normalization of initially pathological venous TCCS within 90 days is related to a favorable outcome in this disease </plain></SENT>
