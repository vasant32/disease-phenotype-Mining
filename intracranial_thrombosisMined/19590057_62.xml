<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, single-arm study, 125 patients with neurological deficits as defined by a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &gt; or =8, presented within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and an angiographic occlusion (Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> [TIMI] Grade 0 or 1) of a treatable large intracranial vessel were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented within 3 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had to be ineligible or refractory to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed clinically for 90 days postprocedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 125 target vessels in 125 patients were treated by the Penumbra System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure, 81.6% of the treated vessels were successfully revascularized to TIMI 2 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 18 procedural events reported in 16 patients (12.8%), 3 patients (2.4%) had events that were considered serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 patients (28%) were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> on 24-hour CT of which 14 (11.2%) were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cause mortality was 32.8% at 90 days with 25% of the patients achieving a modified Rankin Scale score of &lt; or =2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the Penumbra System allows safe and effective revascularization in patients experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to large vessel occlusive disease who present within 8 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
