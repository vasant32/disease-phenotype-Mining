<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is no consensus whether to use unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect on clinical outcome of each type of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A nonrandomized comparison of a prospective cohort study (the International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp>) of 624 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients not treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (n = 107) and those who sequentially received both types of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (n = 99) were excluded from the primary analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter were included in a secondary analysis, allocated according to the type of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> given first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was functional independency at 6 months (modified Rankin scale score â‰¤ 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were complete recovery (modified Rankin scale score 0 to 1), mortality, and new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 119 patients received low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (28%) and 302 received unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significantly more patients treated with low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> were functionally independent after 6 months, both in univariate analysis (odds ratio, 2.1; CI, 1.0 to 4.2) and after adjustment for prognostic factors and imbalances (odds ratio, 2.4; CI, 1.0 to 5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the secondary analysis, there was a similar, nonsignificant trend (odds ratio, 1.7; CI, 0.80 to 3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was associated with less new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio, 0.29; CI, 0.07 to 1.3), especially in patients with intracerebral lesions at baseline (adjusted odds ratio, 0.19; CI, 0.04 to 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in complete recovery and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This nonrandomized study in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> suggests a better efficacy and safety of low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> over unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> seems preferable above unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> for the initial treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
