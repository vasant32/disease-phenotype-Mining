<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to establish whether there is an association between changes in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvasculature and lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that might provide clues to the pathology of cerebral small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at three centres in two countries (Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, and Singapore) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had standardised clinical assessments, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photography, and CT or MRI of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvasculature were assessed from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs by graders who were masked to the patients' clinical details </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was diagnosed according to a modified version of the TOAST criteria (Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Trial) or the OCSP criteria (Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project) and by MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We recruited 1321 patients aged 19 to 94 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 410 (31%) had lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were no more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p=0.12), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p=0.51), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> (p=0.91) than were patients with other types of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were more likely to have <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> microvessel signs, particularly when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was confirmed using diffusion-weighted MRI, than were patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, sex, study site, smoking history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the patients with lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were more likely than those with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes to have microvessel signs, and when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype was confirmed by diffusion-weighted MRI the odds ratios were: 3.55 (95% CI 1.77-7.12) for focal arteriolar narrowing; 1.96 (1.19-3.24) for arteriovenous nipping; 2.32 (1.42-3.79) for enhanced light reflex of the arteriolar wall; 1.33 (0.74-2.41) for generalised <z:hpo ids='HP_0008043'>retinal arteriolar narrowing</z:hpo>; 1.45 (0.84-2.51) for small <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriole:venule ratio; and 1.35 (0.80-2.26) for <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venular widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a manifestation of non-atherothrombotic occlusive small vessel disease, which might have implications for the prevention and treatment of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
