<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report and review of literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT(S): A 38-year-old nulliparous woman who developed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085083" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="OHSS">ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome</z:e> on luteal day (LD) 5 during an IVF cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemoconcentration was corrected, ascitis drained, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On LD7, the patient complained of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and neck pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the head showed extensive cortical vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, including the superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION(S): The patient was fully heparinized using low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On LD15 she was discharged home on <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, after confirming a negative pregnancy test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> work-up was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULT(S): Repeat MRI 2 months later revealed patent superior sagittal sinus and transverse sinuses, unremarkable cortical veins, and no evidence of flow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient was asymptomatic, with no neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION(S): Extensive intracranial sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in women undergoing IVF may present with minimal symptoms and can occur in the absence of pregnancy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and despite <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> prophylaxis and correction of hemoconcentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Medical management was successful and left the patient with no neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
