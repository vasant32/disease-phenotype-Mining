<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is recommended in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in adults, then for 3-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In children, 2 consensus reports published in 2008 also recommend use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, whereas conclusions diverge for newborns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These consensus reports are based on observational studies, authors' experience, and comparisons with adult pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the original studies published since then, the French Society of Pediatric Neurology (Société française de neurologie pédiatrique [SFNP]) wished to update the level of evidence and the knowledge in this domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results from the analysis of the literature show that anticoagulation is widely used in pediatrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is well-tolerated in children (class I, level of evidence B) and probably in the newborn (class IIa, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, anticoagulation is probably effective in reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in children (class IIa, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is not possible to draw a conclusion on newborns (class IIb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over the longer term, anticoagulation is effective in reducing the risk of recurrence (class I, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Since this risk is highly dependent on a number of individual factors (the main ones being the child's age, the cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and the kinetics of the sinus recanalization), the duration of anticoagulation should be analyzed individually (class I, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, the convergence of the results, the physiopathologic arguments, and the concordance with the data on adult patients has led to the following recommendations: in the absence of a contra-indication, it is reasonable to propose anticoagulation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonging this treatment for 3-6 months is indicated depending on the number of individual factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a contra-indication, anticoagulation may be considered individually in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in newborns for 6-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
