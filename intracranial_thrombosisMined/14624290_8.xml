<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Malondialdehyde could be a sensor for tissue damage and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, released due to the early arrival of leukocytes in the brain parenchyma, could be a sensor for nonflow phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereby, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the behavior of malondialdehyde and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> within the 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients up to an age of 49 years, admitted to the emergency of University Hospital and Chiquinquir√° Hospital in Maracaibo, Venezuela, were examined by a neurologist and underwent 12-lead electrocardiograms and computed tomography for the diagnosis of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum malondialdehyde and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> were measured as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> adducts and total <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrites</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data were collected within the 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Malondialdehyde for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a significant increase (P&lt;0.001) when compared with healthy controls (47.9 +/- 7.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.2 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, serum nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a significant decrease (P&lt;0.001) when compared with the control group (14.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 41.3 +/- 3.7 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest values of malondialdehyde and the highest values of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> were observed in two patients, who died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of malondialdehyde increase, and serum levels of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> diminish within 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that serum malondialdehyde level could be used as potentially reliable and sensitive marker for reperfusion, whereas nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> levels could acts as potential biochemical sensor for nonreflow phenomenon </plain></SENT>
