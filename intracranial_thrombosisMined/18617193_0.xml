<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) is a known risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, but few studies document the risk in puerperal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nutritional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) deficiency can cause hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and pregnancy may contribute to this deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the association of plasma total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) levels with puerperal CVT through a case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty women with puerperal CVT and 64 healthy puerperal controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma fasting tHcy was estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography using coulometric electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vitamin B(12) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risk of puerperal CVT was estimated for each of the three variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio for the risk of puerperal CVT with hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> (&gt;90th percentile) was 10.8 (95% CI: 4.0-29.4; adjusted for vitamin B(12) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) levels (&lt;10th percentile) did not increase the risk for puerperal CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and tHcy levels (rho=-0.471, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> is associated with an increased risk of puerperal CVT occurring in Indian women and low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels contribute significantly to hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Regular antenatal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and vitamin B(12) supplementation is likely to lower puerperal tHcy levels, but its clinical benefit needs to be tested by large therapeutic trials </plain></SENT>
