<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene-gene or gene-environment interactions may be responsible for the complex trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>How the interactions contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is still under research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to explore the association between gene-gene interactions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Chinese in a large case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nearly 4,000 participants were recruited from seven clinical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight variants in five candidate genes were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gene-gene interactions were explored by using Generalized Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (GMDR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant gene-gene interaction was found by GMDR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best model including MTHFR C677T, ALOX5AP T2354A and NOTCH3 C381T scored 10 for Cross-Validation Consistency and 9 for Sign Test (P = 0.0107) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The individuals with combination of MTHFR 677TT, ALOX5AP 2354AA and NOTCH3 381TT/TC had a significantly higher risk of thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 3.165, 95% CI 1.461-6.858, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that combination of these alleles conferred higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than single risk allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gene-gene interaction may serve as a novel area for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The three-locus combination may change the susceptibility of particular subjects to the disease </plain></SENT>
