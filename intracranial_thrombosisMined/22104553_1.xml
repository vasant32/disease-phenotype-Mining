<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The fibrinolytic and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems cooperate in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> dissolution and extracellular matrix proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The plasminogen/plasmin system activates MMPs, and some MMPs have been involved in the dissolution of fibrin by targeting fibrin(ogen) directly or by collaborating with plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MMP-10 has been implicated in inflammatory/thrombotic processes and vascular integrity, but whether MMP-10 could have a profibrinolytic effect and represent a promising thrombolytic agent is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of MMP-10 on fibrinolysis was studied in vitro and in vivo, in MMP-10-null mice (Mmp10(-/-)), with the use of 2 different murine models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>: laser-induced carotid injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro, we showed that MMP-10 was capable of enhancing tissue plasminogen activator-induced fibrinolysis via a thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor inactivation-mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, delayed fibrinolysis observed after photochemical carotid injury in Mmp10(-/-) mice was reversed by active recombinant human MMP-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a thrombin-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, the reperfusion and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in sham or tissue plasminogen activator-treated animals were severely impaired in Mmp10(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this model, administration of active MMP-10 to <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> animals significantly reduced blood reperfusion time and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size to the same extent as tissue plasminogen activator and was associated with shorter <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This effect was not observed in thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor-deficient mice, suggesting thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor inactivation as one of the mechanisms involved in the MMP-10 profibrinolytic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A novel profibrinolytic role for MMP-10 in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is described, opening new pathways for innovative fibrinolytic strategies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
