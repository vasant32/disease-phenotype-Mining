<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Secreted isoforms of amyloid beta-protein precursor (AbetaPP) that contain the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor domain, also known as protease nexin-2 (PN2), are enriched in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although little is known of its physiological function, the potent inhibition of certain prothrombotic proteinases by PN2/AbetaPP suggests that it may function to regulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> during vascular injury events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To examine the antithrombotic function of cerebral PN2/AbetaPP in vivo, we performed measurements of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in transgenic mice with specific and modest overexpression of PN2/AbetaPP in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and Tg-rPF4/APP mice, a model that possesses specific and modest overexpression of PN2/AbetaPP in platelets and exhibits reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Modest overexpression of PN2/AbetaPP in transgenic mouse brain had no effect on intraluminal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> but resulted in larger <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> volumes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (23.1+/-2.7 mm(3) [n=6; P&lt;0.01] and 1411+/-202 microg/hemisphere [n=12; P&lt;0.01], respectively), compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice (15.9+/-2.2 mm(3) [n=6] and 935+/-418 microg/hemisphere [n=12], respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that cerebral PN2/AbetaPP plays a significant role in regulating <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in brain and that modest age-related increases in the cerebral levels of this protein could markedly enhance the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
