<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (n=10), suture occlusion group (n=12), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> suture occlusion model group (n=12) in which both autologous blood clot and nylon thread were used (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occluded group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as a result of MCAO in suture occlusion group was replicated by insertion of nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occluded group, a <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> catheter containing a nylon thread was inserted into the middle carotid artery via external carotid artery, and the nylon thread was pulled out to an appropriate length to allow blood to coagulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes later, thrombin was injected, and the nylon thread was re-inserted to complete MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specimens were taken after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms were observed, brain water ratio and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> size were measured, and the pathological changes in the brain tissue were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with sham operation group, the evaluation score of neurological symptoms was significantly higher, and water content and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> size were larger in suture occlusion group and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occluded group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.01); the pathological changes of the brain were also more marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with suture occlusion group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> occlusion group showed no differences in evaluation score, water content, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> size and pathological changes of the brain (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In rats, occlusion of middle cerebral artery with autologous blood clot and inserted nylon thread can result in the functional lesion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and the pathological changes in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MCAO reproduced by this method could produce thrombotic obstruction of the middle cerebral artery for the experimental study of cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury, and it could prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the process of replication of animal model and in the course of thrombolysis therapy in the clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The model has the advantages of precision of the occlusion site, production of constant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> size, easier performance and good repeatability </plain></SENT>
