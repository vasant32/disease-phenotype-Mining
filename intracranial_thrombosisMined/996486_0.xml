<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is increasingly accepted that oral contraceptives foster <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic diseases</z:hpo> (chiefly cerebral ictus) by affecting hemostatic mechanisms causing intimal proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since 1968 the antithrombotic activity of Aspirin has been under study, and Aspirin has proven effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if oral contraceptives foster <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>, Aspirin may prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in women on oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six women with cerebral ictus (the incidence is 10 times higher than in men of the same age and in women not on oral contraceptives) have undergone chest X-ray and ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two underwent pulmonary scintigraphy and 1 pulmonary arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They did not exhibit signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in pulmonary veins or in the heart, a fact which suggested primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was verified by cerebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, Aspirin in a dose not exceeding 1 g per day may be effective in the prevention of ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vizw of the well known side effects of Aspirin, this hypothesis would need to be tested in a prospective study </plain></SENT>
