<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aggressive endovascular and microsurgical measures may be necessary to salvage life and minimize <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> morbidity in this extreme situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have treated two middle-aged women who presented within an hour of spontaneous cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, forced head and eye deviation, and declining consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first patient had a carotid occlusion through which a catheter could not be passed, so intracranial thrombolysis was achieved through a microcatheter navigated through the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical intimectomy and thrombectomy of the dissected ICA was then carried out using an intraoperative Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter passed up the dissected ICA, followed by endovascular stenting of the reopened cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient underwent intracranial microsurgical embolectomy and, after an unsuccessful attempt of stenting the dissected and severely narrowed cervical ICA, surgical reopening again with a Fogarty catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients suffered basal ganglionic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but most of the middle cerebral artery territories were preserved and the patients made satisfactory recoveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: "Malignant" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338585" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery dissection</z:e> causing occlusion or near occlusion with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752140" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial embolism</z:e> is an important cause of severe and life-threatening hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment should include aggressive endovascular and microsurgical interventions when the hemisphere is at risk </plain></SENT>
