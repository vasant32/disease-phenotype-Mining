<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains controversial whether elevated plasma levels of small dense <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) are risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to examine the plasma levels of sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and to investigate the associations in a large Chinese case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 299 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (159 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 42 lacunar infarction, 98 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>) and 299 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The semiquantitative analysis of plasma levels of sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was performed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The plasma levels of sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) Multiple regression analysis showed that there were significant relationships between sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, systolic blood pressure and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and a significant relationship between sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (r = 0.286, p &lt; 0.001) even after adjusting for these factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Compared with the controls, the calculation of odds ratios indicated relative risk estimates of 3.111 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (OR = 3.111 , 95% CI = 1.891-5.117, p &lt; 0.001) and 3.164 for hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR = 3.164, 95% CI = 1.632-6.137, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Plasma sd-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was independently associated with both thrombotic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting it may be an independent predictor of as well as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Chinese people, justifying clinical trials for primary and secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> or fibrates </plain></SENT>
