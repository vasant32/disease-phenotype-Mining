<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to compare thin-section NCT with 5-mm NCT in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enrolled were consecutive 51 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction in the anterior or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent both 5-mm NCT and either 1.25- or 1-mm thin-section helical NCT within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to either the single or multisegmental occlusion group, depending on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extent on thin-section NCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thin-section NCT and 5-mm NCT were compared in the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> were identified in 45 patients (88%) on thin-section NCT and 16 on 5-mm NCT (31%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No occlusion was seen in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both sensitivity and specificity of thin-section NCT in detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> were 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> can be detected with higher sensitivity on thin-section NCT than on 5-mm NCT, and its extent is more accurately determined on thin-section NCT </plain></SENT>
