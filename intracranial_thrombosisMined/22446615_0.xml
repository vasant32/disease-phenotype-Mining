<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a 13-year-old girl who presented with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e>. family screening for any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> was 20 negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With no secondary cause apparent for persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, we looked for the JAK2 mutation, but the result was negative. in contrast to linkage of JAK2 mutation positivity with increased thrombotic risk, our case showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can occur in the absence of JAK2 mutation in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e>. the indications for treatment and the best treatment of children with ET are currently not known, and guidelines for the management of children with ET are needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult patients have near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy because of the low rate of leukemic conversion, but no child has been monitored long enough to assess prognosis </plain></SENT>
