<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that thrombophilic abnormalities and the use of oral contraceptives (OCs) are the leading causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the association between CVT and thrombophilic states, OCs, and their interaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For data sources, we used the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases (January 1994 to March 2005), reference lists of retrieved articles, and contact with content experts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We selected studies comparing the prevalence of OC use and the prevalence of prothrombitic abnormalities in patients with CVT compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted study characteristics, quality, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each trial and pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen studies were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an increased risk of CVT in patients using OCs (OR 5.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.95 to 7.91; P &lt; .001), and in patients with factor V Leiden (OR 3.38; 95% CI 2.27 to 5.05; P &lt; .001), with mutation G20 210A of prothrombin (OR 9.27; 95% CI 5.85 to 14.67; P &lt; .001) and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (OR 4.07; 95% CI 2.54 to 6.52; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that OC users, and patients with factor V Leiden, the prothrombin G20 120A mutation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> are at a significantly increased risk of CVT </plain></SENT>
