<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antiplatelet therapy is currently one of the methods for preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because antiplatelet agents are generally administered on a long-term basis, patient compliance is an important factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the compliance of patients during antiplatelet therapy by testing platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To establish the conditions for measuring platelet aggregation, the platelet aggregation test was performed in patients taking 81 mg/d aspirin or 200 mg/d <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> at the following final concentrations of aggregation-inducing agents: 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mumol/L <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and 0.5 and 2 micrograms/mL collagen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The optimum measurement conditions for assessing patient compliance were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions determined in the first study, platelet aggregation was assessed, and the effects of treatment were studied in 159 outpatients and 79 inpatients undergoing antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the antiplatelet effect was insufficient, compliance was checked by interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The agents used and the final concentrations found to be optimum for assessing platelet aggregation were 2 micrograms/mL collagen for patients taking aspirin 81 mg/day and 2 mumol/L <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> for patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> 200 mg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 17 (10%) of the 159 outpatients, platelet aggregation was not adequately reduced because of noncompliance with their antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that monitoring of compliance is important for outpatients on antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is best if platelet aggregation can be checked, but when this is impossible it is necessary to assess compliance periodically and provide patient guidance </plain></SENT>
