<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a patient who was receiving high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: A 43-year-old woman presented with overwhelming proximal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgias</z:hpo>, swelling in her hands, facial and knee <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, numbness in her left arm, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>lower-back pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical examination revealed that she had symptoms consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was initially treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> but developed a severe adverse drug reaction to the medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was discontinued, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for a first-time dose of IVIG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the infusion, the patient was found to have a facial droop, left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, and an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large, significant right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was discovered and initially treated mechanically and then with drugs in an attempt to establish revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subsequent computed tomography scan of the brain demonstrated a large right-middle cerebral distribution <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with slight <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IVIG is increasingly being used for many approved and non-approved indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although rare, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> caused by the administration of IVIG has been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the Naranjo probability scale, this adverse drug event was calculated as a probable reaction due to the administration of IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after receiving a high dose of IVIG for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients should be given a slower rate of infusion and smaller dosages of IVIG, and they should be closely monitored for potential <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during IVIG therapy </plain></SENT>
