<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Environmental stimulation consistently increases dentate neurogenesis in the adult brain and improves spatial learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis whether specific rehabilitative training of an impaired forelimb influences these processes after focal cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Focal cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were induced in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex using the photothrombosis model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One group of infarcted animals and sham-operated controls housed in standard cages received one daily session of skilled reaching training of the impaired or dominant forelimb, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A second group was transferred to an enriched environment, whereas a third group remained in the standard cages without further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bromodeoxyuridine was administered from day 2 until day 6 postinfarct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation and differentiation of newborn cells was analyzed at day 10 and 42 using immunocytochemistry with neuronal and glial markers and confocal laser scanning microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Spatial learning was tested in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> between days 35 and 41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, environmental enrichment as well as daily reaching training of the impaired paw both increase dentate neurogenesis and improve functional performance in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the reaching training-induced neurogenic response was significantly greater in nonlesioned controls associated with the best spatial learning performance in the water maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Skilled forelimb training effectively stimulates dentate neurogenesis and spatial learning in the infarcted and healthy brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this reaching training-induced increase in neurogenesis was reduced after cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
