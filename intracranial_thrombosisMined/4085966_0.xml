<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the clinical importance of tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) on the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, it is essential to be measured t-PA level in human plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Taking advantage of strong affinity of t-PA to fibrin, t-PA was isolated with Fibrin/Celite column chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunological activities of t-PA of plasma samples determined by ELISA and the elution pattern of it on Fibrin/Celite column chromatography were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results are as follows: The t-PA in human plasma was consisted of fibrin adsorbable t-PA and fibrin nonadsorbable t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both types of t-PA could be measured separately by using of Fibrin/Celite column chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fibrin adsorbable t-PA fraction showed two types of molecular size (major peak was Mr congruent to 70,000, minor peak was Mr congruent to 100,000) on Sephadex G-200 chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of t-PA in plasma samples taken from 20 healthy subjects at rest was 2.4 +/- 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>9 ng/ml, and concentration of t-PA increased to 10.4 +/- 3.2 ng/ml after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But the t-PA level of plasma samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> did not increase after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changes of immunologically determined t-PA in plasma samples induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> were not reflected in the fibrinolytic activities of the euglobulin fractions, but well reflected in the fibrinolytic activities of the elution fractions on Fibrin/Celite column chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of fibrin nonadsorbable t-PA did not change by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e>, but the level of fibrin adsorbable t-PA increased from 5.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml to 9.7 +/- 2.7 ng/ml in the case of 6 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that, the plasma t-PA increased by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> was the fibrin adsorbable t-PA, and it may play a very important role in physiological fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
