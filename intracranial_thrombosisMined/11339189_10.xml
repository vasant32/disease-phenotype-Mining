<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective study of cases with a prenatal diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of fetal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dural sinuses was established in three uncomplicated pregnancies at 21, 22 and 28 weeks' gestation by transabdominal and transvaginal sonography, demonstrating a blood clot within the dilated dural sinuses, always in the region of the torcular Herophilii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was further confirmed by the color Doppler demonstration of absence of blood flow within the dilated dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon request of the couples two pregnancies were terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One infant was delivered at term by Cesarean section and died during neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the cerebral venous circulation can occur antenatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accurate diagnosis can be made using fetal real-time and color Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
