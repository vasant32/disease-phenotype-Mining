<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to determine the characteristics of patients with CI, as well as their outcomes as regards the territories affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were collected from 124 patients admitted to our department during a five-year period, with a radiological diagnosis of CI, and with or without involvement of other brain territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age in our series was 65.2 years, with most being male (68.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was the most commonly affected territory at 49.2%, followed by superior cerebellar artery (SCA) at 17.7%, and anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) at 10.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was simultaneous supratentorial involvement in 13.7%, and two or three cerebellar arteries involved in 8.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main aetiology in PICA was atherothrombosis (P=.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, cardio-embolism was the main origin in cases with more than one affected territory (P=.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No particular aetiology could be found in SCA and AICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was haemorrhagic transformation in 29 patients (23.4%), particularly in the PICA and when other territories were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in 15 patients (12.1%, 12 of them PICA; P=.02) in 2.9 ± 1.5 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At discharge, the degree of disability was worse if more than one arterial territory was involved (Rankin ≥ 3, 64% versus 31-36%; P=.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four (3.2%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CI is very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that PICA infarction is the most frequent type and its aetiology is usually atherothrombotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is the territory most frequently associated with severe complications, which take place during the first week of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
