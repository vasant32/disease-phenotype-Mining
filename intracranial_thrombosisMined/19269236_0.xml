<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present an extremely rare autopsy case with traumatic dissection of the extracranial vertebral artery due to blunt injury caused by a traffic accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and numbness of the hands at the scene of the accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His consciousness deteriorated and he fell into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> within 12h, then died 4 days after the collision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain CT/MRI disclosed massive infratentorial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> while MRA imaged neither of the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autopsy revealed a seatbelt mark on the right side of the lower neck, with fracture of the right transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The right extracranial vertebral artery (V2) showed massive medial dissection from the portion adjacent to the fracture throughout the upper end of the extracranial part of the artery and was occluded by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An intimal tear was confirmed near the starting point of the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain disclosed massive infarction of posterior circulation territories with changes to the so-called respirator brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The victim's left vertebral artery was considerably hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that a massive infratentorial infarction was caused by dissection of the right extracranial vertebral artery and consecutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation brought about by impact with the seatbelt at the time of the collision </plain></SENT>
