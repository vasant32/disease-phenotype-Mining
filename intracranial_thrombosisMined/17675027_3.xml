<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients (age: &gt;1 month and &lt;19 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Vorarlberg, Austria, from 1984-2005 were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome was evaluated in terms of neurological deficits, neuropsychological measures, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consequences on therapy were established according to current guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two children, median age 6 years (range, 0.9-14) years, 16 ischemic and 6 hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, correspond to an incidence of 1.96 and 0.74/100.000 child-years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No child died; one had a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty children (12 boys) were included after a median time of 3.7 years (range, 0.4-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were vasculopathy (17/20; 85%), lipometabolic disorders (17/20; 85%), and prothrombotic abnormality (10/20; 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three children had no risk factor; four children had a reduced quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study led to therapeutic consequences in 13 of 20 children (65%): aspirin (5/20; 25%), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> in (3/20; 15%), and rehabilitative therapy (9/20; 45%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most children with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have more than one risk factor, mainly vasculopathies or elevation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall outcome is determined solely by neurological deficits and is positively influenced by good quality of life </plain></SENT>
