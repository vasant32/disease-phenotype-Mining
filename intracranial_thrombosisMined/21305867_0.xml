<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain CT was ordered in an afebrile patient with neck pain and occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since no abnormalities were noted on non-contrast CT study, the patient was discharged with recommendation for routine laboratory tests and plain X-ray of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> developed the next day with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the patient was sent back to the Neurology Clinic where he developed myoclonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> compatible with focal motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging, performed two days later, revealed a huge hemorrhagic venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the left posterior cerebral hemisphere associated with typical signs of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subtle curvilinear hyperdensities were detected within the left parietal cortico-subcortical border zone on reevaluation of the initial brain CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A posteriori these were thought to be compatible with a developing venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, associated with subtle signs most consistent with combined cortical vein and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No improvement was noted after administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment and the patient died 11 days after the initial CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detection of early CT signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is extremely important, since delaying adequate treatment may have catastrophic consequences </plain></SENT>
