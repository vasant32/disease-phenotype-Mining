<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The younger patient also suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, while the other one had protein S and complement C4 deficiencies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both girls developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001285'>spastic tetraparesis</z:hpo> as a sequela of the previous infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two patients were treated with aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, with remission of the infarctions during the next 8 months of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A primary deficiency of protein C or S is proposed which would produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> with exposure of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>; this <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> then, like antigens, would generate antibodies acting on the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, exacerbating the thrombotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of complement C4 deficiency is an additional risk factor </plain></SENT>
