<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As part of an ongoing project to study interactions between neuron and platelet, we used organotypic explant cultures of rat spinal cord to study if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> had a morphologically demonstrable neurotoxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> may be neurotoxic, and that this effect may be prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi>, a specific 5HT2 <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Related experiments, using acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity as a biochemical parameter, indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> hastens the decline of enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> at which neurotoxicity was demonstrated were comparable to the calculated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> concentration potentially present in the vicinity of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0936263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
