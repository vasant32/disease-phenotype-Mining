<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To explore the hypothesis that albumin's protective effect is mediated in part by salutary intravascular mechanisms, we assessed microvascular hemodynamics in a model of laser-induced cortical arteriolar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cortical microcirculation of anesthetized, physiologically monitored Sprague-Dawley rats was studied in vivo via a frontoparietal cranial window (intact dura) by two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> laser-scanning microscopy after plasma-labeling with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was produced in 30- to 50-mum cortical arterioles by laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar flow velocity was measured repeatedly by line-scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 30 minutes post-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, animals were treated with either human albumin, 2 g/kg, or with saline control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline arteriolar flow velocity averaged 3.5+/-1.8 mm/s and was reduced to 10% to 13% of control values by laser-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, which also led to focal vasodilatation (mean, 49% above baseline diameter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Saline treatment at 30 minutes post-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> failed to influence arteriolar flow velocity, which remained depressed at 10% to 22% of control throughout the subsequent 60- to 90-minute observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By contrast, albumin treatment induced a prompt rise in median flow velocity to 38% of control by 10 minutes post-treatment, and to 61% to 67% of control by 50 to 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose albumin therapy induces a prompt, sustained improvement in microvascular hemodynamics distal to a cortical arteriolar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; these data support an important intravascular component to albumin's protective effect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
