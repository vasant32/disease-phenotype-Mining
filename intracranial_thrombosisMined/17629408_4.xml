<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated epileptogenesis after cortical photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> dye in adult Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To detect spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, video-electroencephalograms were recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 months for 7-14 days (24 h/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the end, spatial and emotional learning and memory were assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> and fear-conditioning test, respectively, and the brains were processed for histologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were detected in 18% of rats that received photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency was 0.39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> per recording day and mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> duration was 117 s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over 60% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> occurred during the dark hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats with photothrombotic lesions were impaired in the water-maze (P&lt;0.05) but not in the fear-conditioning test as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histology revealed that lesion depth varied from cortical layers I to VI in photothrombotic rats with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epileptic</z:e> rats had light mossy fiber sprouting in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus both ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study extends the current understanding of epileptogenesis and functional impairment after cortical lesions induced by photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our observations support the hypothesis that photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats is a useful animal model for investigating the mechanisms of post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> epileptogenesis </plain></SENT>
