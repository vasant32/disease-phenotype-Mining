<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Recent findings have indicated the association between APC-resistance and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These reports prompted us to investigate whether resistance to APC could be found in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Therefore, we studied APC-resistance in 50 young adults (&lt; or =45 yrs) with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of fifty cerebrovascular subjects showed APC-resistance, while 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">PC deficiency</z:e> and 3 PS deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No deficiencies in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein AT III and in fibrinolytic proteins were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family history demonstrated a distribution of APC-resistance compatible with dominant autosomal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), which is a marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable states</z:e>, was also measured in patients and family members of resistant subjects (n = 38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA analysis showed factor V R506Q mutation (Leiden mutation) in 11 patients and their relatives with poor response to activated protein C detected by APTT tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 11 investigated subjects with APC-resistance, 9 were heterozygotes and 2, with the lowest APC-ratio values, were homozygotes for factor V mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 38 relatives, 22 showed a poor response to APC and according to the APC-ratio values, 18 were heterozygotes and 4 homozygotes for FV Leiden mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mutation, in heterozygous form, was also found in 2% of our <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population (n = 100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of F1+2 was significantly higher both in 11 individuals carrying the FV:Q506 mutation and in 39 patients without APC-resistance compared to that found in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the patients with FV:Q506 mutation showed the highest values in F1+2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the studied family members F1+2 plasma levels were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a possible involvement of APC-resistance in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in young adults and agree with the hypothesis that individuals with APC-resistance have an imbalance between pro-and anti-coagulant forces leading to increased thrombin generation and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
