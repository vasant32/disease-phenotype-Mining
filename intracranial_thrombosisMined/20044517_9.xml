<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence of atrial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AT/AF) is often sought in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied patients with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (TE) who were implanted with devices capable of continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> monitoring to comprehensively quantify the incidence and duration of newly detected AT/AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study represents a subgroup analysis of the TRENDS trial, which included patients with clinical indications for pacemakers or defibrillators and &gt;or=1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, age 65 or older, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or previous TE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A history of AF was not required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> implanted devices were capable of continuously monitoring the cumulative time spent in AT/AF each day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This analysis focuses primarily on the incidence and duration of newly detected AT/AF (defined as &gt;or=5 minutes of AT/AF on any day) in patients with previous TE, no documented history of AF, and no <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> or antiarrhythmic drug use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 319 patients had a history of TE and &gt;or=1 day of device data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with a documented history of AF (n=80), <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> use (n=56), or antiarrhythmic drug use (n=20) were excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 163 patients, newly detected AT/AF was identified via the device in 45 patients (28%) over a mean follow-up of 1.1+/-0.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AT/AF recurred infrequently, with only 12 patients experiencing AT/AF on &gt;10% of follow-up days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Newly detected episodes of AT/AF were found via continuous monitoring in 28% of patients with previous TE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most episodes would not have been detected by standard intermittent monitoring techniques </plain></SENT>
