<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> can complicate the management of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While the principles of management of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> are similar to the more common cardiogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo>, placing a patient in the prone position may be a helpful maneuver facilitating recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe a case of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis where prone ventilation was employed to treat neurogenic cardio-pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This resulted in rapid resolution of neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> and patient recovery after recanulation of the basilar artery by intra-arterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This technique of prone positioning for ventilation is of importance to physicians who manage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and its complications </plain></SENT>
