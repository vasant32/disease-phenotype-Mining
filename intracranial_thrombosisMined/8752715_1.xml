<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 95 E-PAf patients (mean age 73.6), 79 Y-PAf patients (mean age 52.4), and 95 E-CAf patients (mean age 73.6) were studied </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262935" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain embolism</z:e> occurred in 2.7% of E-PAf patients per year which was significantly lower than in E-CAf patients (5.1%/yr) and higher than in Y-PAf patients (1.3%/yr) (p &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>E-PAf patients suffered more brain <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> than Y-PAf patients, but they had nearly the same incidence as did E-CAf patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven E-PAf patients had only one attack of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and the remaining 38 had more than two attacks </plain></SENT>
