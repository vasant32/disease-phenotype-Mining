<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four-vessel angiography has been considered the most reliable investigation in the diagnosis of BD for &gt;30 yrs, but it is invasive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT provides noninvasive, multiplanar imaging of brain tissue perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to check the reliability of SPECT compared with contrast angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective, blind study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Neurointensive care unit of a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Consecutive clinically brain dead patients with flat electroencephalogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: BD was diagnosed according to Italian law </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT and four-vessel angiography were performed in the same session; the rater of each investigation ignored the results of the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, Sp<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27140">(O2)</z:chebi>, and P(ECO2) were monitored throughout the study: any episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> caused exclusion of the patient from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty brain dead patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cause of BD was head injury in seven cases (35%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in seven (30%), spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in one (10%), <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> in two (10%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in two (10%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sagittal sinus in one (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both angiography and SPECT confirmed BD in 19 of 20 patients: angiography showed the absence of filling of intracranial arteries, while SPECT showed a picture of "empty skull." For the remaining patient, angiography showed slight and late filling of left vertebral, basilar, and posterior cerebral arteries, while SPECT showed faint traces of uptake in the posterior fossa on the right side and on the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For this patient, the tests were repeated 48 hrs later, and both showed the arrest of intracranial circulation, thus confirming BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the reliability of SPECT in the diagnosis of BD; because SPECT is noninvasive, it is a good candidate for the "gold standard" of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
