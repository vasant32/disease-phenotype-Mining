<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We followed and evaluated the potential risks of recanalization of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> embolized with BPCs for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 301 unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 252 patients were treated with BPCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast stasis was observed on initial postembolization angiograms in 104 (34.6%) of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For follow-up, skull images by an angiographic unit (at 3, 9, 15, and 21 months), CE-MRA including TOF source images (at 6, 12, and 18 months), and DSA (at 24 months) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 89 (85.6%) of the 104 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with contrast stasis, the stasis disappeared on 6-month MRAs and occlusions remained unchanged without recanalization for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 15 (14.4%), recanalization occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of contrast stasis was not found to be associated with the obliteration rate (P = .641) or packing attenuation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without contrast stasis 30.7% ± 11.18 versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with contrast stasis 33.0% ± 12.11, P = .113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Contrast stasis was not found to be a risk factor for recanalization (15/104 [14.4%] versus 29/197 [14.7%], P = 1.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contrast stasis is a benign angiographic finding that can disappear within 6 months on follow-up MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, contrast stasis was not found to be associated with a low obliteration rate or packing attenuation or to be a risk factor for recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with contrast stasis on initial postembolization angiograms are no more likely to recanalize than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> without contrast stasis </plain></SENT>
