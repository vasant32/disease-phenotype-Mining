<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate whether the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e> (FVL), the prothrombin gene G20210A variant or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype are risk factors for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH) in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen full-term infants with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> documented with magnetic resonance imaging were assessed with the whole spectrum of assays for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> including the three DNA-based prothrombotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of congenital defects was compared with that observed in 38 healthy full-term infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic defects were also assessed in 55 premature neonates, gestational age &lt;32 wk, 17 of whom developed IVH, grade II-IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 38 premature neonates without IVH were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> group: a prothrombotic factor was detected in 53% of patients and an underlying disease or a triggering event in 61.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of FVL in thrombosed neonates was higher (23%) than in the group of healthy full-term infants (10.5%), although it did not reach statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IVH developed in 30.9% of premature neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apart from several maternal or neonatal risk factors for IVH, FII G20210A was found in a considerably higher prevalence in the cohort of neonates with IVH (12%) than in those without (2%), although the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> or IVH in neonates is multifactorial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Along with underlying diseases or triggering events, congenital prothrombotic factors (FVL or FII G20210A) showed a trend towards a higher frequency in full-term infants with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or premature neonates with IVH than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, their contribution to neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> or IVH remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
