<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The biological <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defence system against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is an integrated array of enzymes such as <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathion peroxidase (GPx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the evolution of SOD and CAT activities as possible markers of oxidative activity in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To establish the relationship between the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the activity of these two enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To analyze the relationship between the degree of neurological deficits of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and SOD and CAT activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study comprising 45 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (24 females and 21 males), aged from 48 to 96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were classified in atherotrombotics and cardioembolics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SOD and CAT activities were measured on days 1, 3, 6 and 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Activities of SOD and CAT in patients on admission were lower than those of controls and showed a gradual increase over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The activity mean of SOD was significantly higher in cardioembolic infarctions than in atherotrombotic infarctions (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SOD activity was significantly lower for Mathew score &gt; 60, while CAT activity was higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a progressive increase in SOD and CAT activity during ictus evolution, a different activity of SOD and CAT in cardioembolic and atherotrombotic infarctions, and that there is a relationship between activity of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzymes and Mathew's score </plain></SENT>
