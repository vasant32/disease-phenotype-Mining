<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the components N1 and P3 of the ERP's to target stimuli, reference-independent measures (latency, global field power, location of maximal or minimal potential, and location of centroids) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> patients displayed P3 abnormalities in latency, amplitude, and electrical field on the scalp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, N1 electrical fields were also abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ERP abnormalities correlated significantly with the extent of mental function impairment in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and they improved after administration of a cerebral metabolic enhancer (Nefiracetam: DM-9384) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ERP's seemed to be sensitive in indicating the effects of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that time-course analysis of the spatial distribution of the ERP electrical field might be useful for evaluation of the extent of mental function impairment and the efficacy of drugs </plain></SENT>
