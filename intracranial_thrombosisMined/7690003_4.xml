<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A radioimmunoassay based on using two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of alpha-granule membrane protein (<z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140) was used to determine whether plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 can be detected in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and in patients during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAb SZ-51 was used as a solid phase, and 125I-labeled MAb S12 was used as a fluid phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assay is so sensitive that it can detect as little as 1 ng/ml of purified <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 4.2% (n = 5) and 7.1% (n = 8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentration of plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 was found to be 10.0 +/- 4.5 ng/ml (mean +/- SD, n = 20) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients undergoing CPB demonstrated a transient increase in the concentration of plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140, especially at 2 h after CPB, and the plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 level was inversely correlated with the decreased platelet counts during bypass (r = -0.81, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was found that the concentration of plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 increased significantly after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 reached the peak within 3 days and changed with the process of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> (n = 16) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concentration of plasma <z:chebi fb="10" ids="17345">GMP</z:chebi>-140 increased significantly in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase but not after relief.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
