<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, treatment with induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is a widely accepted measure to reverse ischemic deficits caused by vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, a combination of the two regimens--nimodipine and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>--may have real benefits for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But it is possible that the benefit of one is abolished by adverse effects of the other, or that a combination of both may not be as effective as the use of only one therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate these problems, the effects of nimodipine and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on cerebral vessel, cerebral blood flow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> using a one hour middle-cerebral-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one anesthetized cats were divided into a control group, the nimodipine-treated group, and the nimodipine-and-induced-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were seven cats in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was continued for one hour in each animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was a little higher than resting values, and it was continued for only one hour during <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, brought on by instillation of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral pial arteries dilated much more prominently during and after the occlusion of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in the nimodipine-and-induced-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group than other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although cerebral blood flow in the nimodipine group, and the nimodipine-and-induced-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> group increased more in the non-ischemic hemisphere, the most remarkable increase was seen around the infarcted cortex in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
