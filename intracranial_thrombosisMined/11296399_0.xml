<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to establish the system for YAG laser-induced reperfusion of photothrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male spontaneously hypertensive rats(5-7 months old, 350-450 g) were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>, endotracheally intubated, and mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The photosensitizing dye <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>(20 mg/kg body weight) was administered intravenously over 90 sec starting simultaneously with 3 min of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="49696">krypton</z:chebi> laser irradiation(568 nm, 20 mW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The irradiated middle cerebral artery was completely occluded by an intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A YAG laser operating at 355 nm(16 mW, 15 Hz) was focused with a cylindrical lens and positioned with a mirror onto the occluded distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This YAG laser irradiation for approximately 3 min caused reperfusion of the thrombosed distal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a novel method of reperfusion in the photothrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reperfusion model should facilitate study of the therapeutic window for reversibility in thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
