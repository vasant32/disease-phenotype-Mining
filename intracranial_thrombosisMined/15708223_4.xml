<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is insufficient data on short- and especially long-term prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 79 consecutive patients, we analyzed factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and functional outcome at hospital discharge and after 6 months as well as long-term prognosis &gt;/=12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were graded on the National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was defined as mRS &gt;/= 3 at 6 months, secondary outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during hospital treatment and number as well as type of complications during follow-up &gt;/=12 months after hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients were recruited prospectively, 37 were identified by chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Information on outcome was based on neurological examinations at our outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Factors significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were age, the NIHSS on admission, more than two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> treatment, venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and hemorrhagic transformation of the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome after 6 months in 74 patients was excellent with 73% of patients reaching a mRS 0-1, 4% a mRS of 2, and 23% a mRS 3-6, including 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly related to a mRS &gt;/= 3 at 6 months in a logistic regression analysis were age and items 1a-c of the NIHSS on admission related to consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight surviving patients had a follow-up &gt;/= 12 months (median: 31; mean: 52 +/- 61 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most frequent complication on long-term follow-up was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in nine patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of illness has been survived, CVT has a good prognosis unlike arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
