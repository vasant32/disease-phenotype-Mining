<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether microbleeds are associated with the incidence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> while on outpatient treatment with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were selected from a consecutive cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-using subjects with no history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> were randomly selected during the same time period (n = 48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared demographic factors, vascular risk factors, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings including microbleeds between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Result: There were more cases of patients with microbleeds in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> than control group (79.2% vs 22.9%: p &lt; 0.001), and the number of microbleeds was much higher for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> group (9.0 +/- 26.8 vs 0.5 +/- 1.03: p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of microbleeds was significantly correlated with the presence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (r = 0.299; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that increased prothrombin time and the presence of microbleeds were independently related to the incidence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (microbleeds: adjusted OR, 83.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that underlying microbleeds are independently associated with an incidence of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Future research should focus on elucidating the risks and benefits of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> medication in patients with microbleeds </plain></SENT>
