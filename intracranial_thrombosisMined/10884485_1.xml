<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>Cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo> in cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) is rare, its pathophysiology remains unclear, and data from electrophysiological examinations in such patients are missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 17-year-old woman with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> who was admitted with extensive multiple CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, she developed isolated right peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography showed segmental occlusion of the ipsilateral transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> occurred concomitant with recanalization of the transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Facial neurography, including transcranial magnetic stimulation of the facial nerve and related motor cortex, ruled out a coincidental idiopathic palsy and revealed conduction block proximal to the facial canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>Facial palsy</z:hpo> in our patient was caused by transient neurapraxia in the intracranial segment of the nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that elevated venous transmural pressure in the nerve's satellite vein, which belongs to the affected drainage territory of the transverse sinus, might have caused venous blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the intrinsic vascular system of the nerve, with leakage of fluids and ions into the endoneurial space and thus an increase in interstitial resistance </plain></SENT>
