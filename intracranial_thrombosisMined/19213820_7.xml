<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With its highly variable clinical presentation, the diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>), and especially of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), as rare but important causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because noncontrast cranial CT (NCCT) is still the imaging technique of choice in most emergency departments, we aimed to investigate its value in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> and DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening our patient data base, we identified 8 patients with DVT and 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also included a control group of 36 patients who had presented with clinical signs of DVT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> but in whom <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was subsequently excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, multidetector row CT angiography (MDCTA), and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were used as the reference standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three independent readers assessed the NCCTs for the presence of direct and indirect signs of DVT or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Direct signs included the presence of hyperattenuated sinuses (ie, cord sign) or veins (ie, attenuated vein sign), whereas parenchymal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were indirect signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the attenuated vein sign for the diagnosis of DVT were 100%, and 99.4%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of the cord sign for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> were 64.6% and 97.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity values of NCCT were 93.7% and 98% for intracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and 94.8% and 98.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although NCCT is insufficient to exclude a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>, its value in the emergency diagnosis of DVT seems to be very high </plain></SENT>
