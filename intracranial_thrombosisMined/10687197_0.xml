<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Throughout 30-35 years 103 male patients aged 40-59 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> and essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were examined (repeated evaluation of protein and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> spectrum, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting and two-step exercise ECG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the entry, the patients had no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo>, discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were verified by the data of autopsy (70.3%) and registry office's records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adequate data were obtained on 93 of 103 patients (90.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the end of the trial 89 of 93 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>78 (87.6%) of them died of MI or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>44 deceased from the subgroup with low TSC level lived, on the average, 65.9 +/- 1.3 years, while 45 deceased from the subgroup with high TSC lived 67.9 +/- 1.4 years, i.e. 2 years longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The worst life prognosis was for patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They lived 60.5 +/- 5.1 years, i.e. 7.5 years less than the rest of the deceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the subgroup with low TSC level there were 5 times more deceased due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> than in the subgroup with high TSC level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients of middle and old age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> require a strictly individual approach to correction of their <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and special alertness for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in low TSC level </plain></SENT>
