<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) occur in approximately 0.14% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common presentations are <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (50%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although they are congenital abnormalities, their angioarchitecture may vary over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rare but well-recognized phenomenon of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> is that of spontaneous obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is not known what factors predispose to spontaneous obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to determine whether spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> can be predicted by their angioarchitecture and whether there is any risk of recurrence once obliteration has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and cross-sectional imaging data amassed over an 18-year period, including follow-up imaging studies and mail surveys of referring and family physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A control group was obtained from contemporaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> of a similar size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 28 cases of spontaneous obliteration in a series of 2162 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time between initial diagnostic angiography and angiographic obliteration was 10 months, during which time there was no intervention and no history of repeat <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>; nor had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> recurred during the follow-up period (mean, 53 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were deep (22/27) with only one draining vein (21/27) and few feeding arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In more than half the cases (15/27) drainage was exclusively into the superficial venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Spontaneous obliteration is rare (1.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Common features include hemorrhagic presentation and few arterial feeding vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although we found no instance of repeat <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> during the follow-up period, <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> can recanalize, and follow-up is therefore recommended </plain></SENT>
