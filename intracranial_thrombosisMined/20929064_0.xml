<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e>] in childhood is a serious disease with reported annual incidence of 0.67 per 100,000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology and pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> in the pediatric population is stilt poorty understood, and the role of thrombophilic risk factors remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In our single tertiary center registry the authors documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> new <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cases of radiologically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> from 1996 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children were consecutively referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> work-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was applied according to treating physicians' decision and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were prospectively followed for a median of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our patient group included 15 males and 8 females whose median age was 2.9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comorbid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic illness</z:e> was present in patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> results were similar in comparison to pediatric controls previously collected at the said medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Short term anticoagulation was immediately initiated in most cases, and neurologic outcome was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither clinical presentation nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase treatment decisions were affected by the presence of thrombophilic risk factors in the specified study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, since <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVT</z:e> is a rare multifactorial disorder, imaging studies are recommended in sick "high-risk" children for better diagnosis and early initiation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of comorbid conditions in most cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> work-up is recommended to determine treatment length and assess potential further future risks </plain></SENT>
