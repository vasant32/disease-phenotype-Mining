<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Information about causes might influence decisions about the use of carotid endarterectomy in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied patients with unilateral symptomatic carotid-<z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and asymptomatic contralateral stenosis from 1988 to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The causes, severity, risk, and predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of the asymptomatic artery were examined and quantified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at five years after study entry in a total of 1820 patients increased with the severity of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 1604 patients with stenosis of less than 60 percent of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter, the risk of a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 8.0 percent (1.6 percent annually), as compared with 16.2 percent (3.2 percent annually) among 216 patients with 60 to 99 percent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group with 60 to 99 percent stenosis, the five-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the territory of a large artery was 9.9 percent, that of lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 6.0 percent, and that of cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 2.1 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some patients had more than one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of more than one cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the territory of an asymptomatic occluded artery (as was identified in 86 patients), the annualized risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.9 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> with different causes had different risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and a higher degree of stenosis; for cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; for lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, age of 75 years or older, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and a higher degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among patients with asymptomatic carotid-<z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-five percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients with asymptomatic stenosis of 60 to 99 percent are attributable to lacunes or cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These observations have implications for the use of endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Without analysis of the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> according to cause, the absolute benefit associated with endarterectomy may be overestimated </plain></SENT>
