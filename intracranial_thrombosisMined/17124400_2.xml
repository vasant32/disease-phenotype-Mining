<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the event of early failure of standard extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass, elective but prompt revision surgery is generally attempted under the assumption that early occlusion is permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the occurrence of spontaneous revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency and time course of spontaneous recanalization in primary extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass occlusion and re-evaluate diagnostic and therapeutic options facing spontaneous development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In a retrospective analysis 176 patients with standard superficial temporal artery/middle cerebral artery bypass were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had primary bypass occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases spontaneous recanalization was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of these cases is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early bypass occlusion has a high incidence of spontaneous recanalization within the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In stable patients the first choice may be noninvasive follow-up and postponing revision operation </plain></SENT>
