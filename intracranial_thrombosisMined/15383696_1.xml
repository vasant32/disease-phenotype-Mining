<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to evaluate the relationship, if present, between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a competitive, chemoluminescence assay, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> were measured in blood samples taken within 24 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences and correlations were tested using frequency test, student-t test and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean serum <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower in the patients than in the control subjects, 245.40 (S.D.: 72.9) and 343.2 (S.D.: 113.0) pg/ml respectively (p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
