<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the role that intravascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> volume plays in mechanical thrombectomy and dose-titrated algorithms using pharmaceutical thrombolytic therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The angiographic studies of 33 consecutive patients (19 women; mean age 66+/-11 years) who underwent endovascular treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A double-injection technique was utilized that involved 2 catheters for simultaneous injection of contrast proximal and distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> to delineate its boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> volume was calculated using the formula for cylindrical objects after measuring its length and diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The volume of the 36 thrombi measured in the study group was 46+/-59 mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean length and diameter were 10+/-6 and 2+/-1 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The time between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and acquisition of angiographic images ranged from 167 to 589 minutes (mean 336+/-109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> volume was not associated with any recanalization (odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 0.02-191) after adjusting for initial occlusion grade, time between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and angiography, and previous intravenous use of thrombolytic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Volume capacities for retrieval devices to retain 50% and 75% of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were estimated as 29.2 mm3 and 55.3 mm3, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The large variation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> volume must be considered in designing retrieval devices to optimize their performance </plain></SENT>
