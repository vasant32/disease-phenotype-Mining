<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of FXII on fibrinolysis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma level of FXII:C, FXII:Ag, FXIIa and beta FXIIa and fibrinolysis activities were examined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Screening of FXII gene mutation by MOEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FXII:C in 22 of 107 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> decreased, which was similar to the feature of FXII cross-reacting material positive (FXII CRM(+)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant increase in plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53373">PLG</z:chebi>:A and alpha(2)AP:A and decrease in D-dimer, moreover, plasma levels of FXIIa and betaFXIIa were lower in patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FXII gene mutation was not found in 22 of 107 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decrease of FXII:C may play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> by reducing activation of plasminogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene mutation of FXII CRM(+)-like abnormal FXII was different from the known FXII gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the regions of FXII Arg (334) and Arg (353) may be more important for the reducing of FXIIa, beta FXIIa levels and fibrinolysis activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FXII assay should be included in thrombotic disorder screening </plain></SENT>
