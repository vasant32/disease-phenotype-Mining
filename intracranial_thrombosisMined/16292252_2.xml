<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study sought to establish the photothrombotic 'ring' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model with late spontaneous reperfusion in adult mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By applying a 3.0-mm diameter laser ring-beam (514 nm, 0.21 mm thick, 0.65 W/cm2) onto the exposed skull for 60 secs with concurrent erythrosin B (4.25 mg/kg) intravenous infusion for 15 secs, the centrally located cortical region within the ring locus was progressively encroached by an annular ring-shaped perfusion deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this region, local cerebral blood flow (lCBF) measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry declined promptly after irradiation to 43% of the baseline value at 30 mins poststroke </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using double tracer autoradiography, quantitative lCBF measured with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine was 46 to 17 to 58 ml/100 g/mins at 4 h to 48 h to 7 days postischemia in this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protein synthesis (CPS), as detected by [3H]leucine incorporation into protein, transiently decreased to 57% to 38% to 112% at 4 h to 48 h to 7 days postischemia in the center region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morphologically, some neurons in the center region appeared swollen at 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 48 h, the majority of neurons were severely swollen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and pyknosis, whereas at 7 days poststroke' the tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> became partly restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The center within the mouse photothrombotic ring lesion thus exhibits reversible alterations of local CBF, CPS and tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> that are reminiscent of the cortical penumbra in other models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
