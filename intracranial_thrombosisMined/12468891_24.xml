<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These long-lasting alterations contribute to the functional deficit and influence long-term recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory neurotransmission is primarily mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>)A receptors assembled of five subunits that allow a variety of adaptive changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the regional distribution of five major <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A)-receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, and gamma2) was analyzed immunohistochemically 1, 7, and 30 days after photochemically induced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When compared with sham-operated controls, a general and regionally differential reduction in immunostaining was found within the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus of both hemispheres for almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within ipsilateral and contralateral neocortical areas, a specific pattern of changes with a differential decrease of subunits alpha1, alpha2, alpha5, and gamma2 and a significant upregulation of subunit alpha3 was observed in the contralateral cortex homotopic to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This dysregulation was most prominent at day 7 and still present at day 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a single application of the noncompetitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>-receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 during lesion induction completely blocked these bihemispheric alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> induced by topical application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> do not change <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A)-receptor subunit expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As alterations in subtype distribution crucially influence inhibitory function, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced modifications in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A)-receptor subtype expression may be of relevance for functional recovery after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
