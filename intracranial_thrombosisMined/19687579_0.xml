<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: It is known that the risk of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence in post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is comparatively higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, and it is suggested that autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system dysfunctions elevate this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the anti-hypertensive effects of cilnidipine, a Ca <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> which suppresses sympathetic nerve activation, in hypertensives with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-stage cerebrovascular disease in a comparison with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> 5-7.5 mg/day, or cilnidipine 5-10 mg/day was administered to 78 hypertensive subjects (greater than 140 mmHg systolic, or 90 mmHg diastolic) undergoing outpatient treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">Amlodipine</z:chebi> or cilnidipine was also administered similarly, to 30 subjects having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> associated with a cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> which occurred more than one month earlier due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> or embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3 months administration, the subjects' blood pressures and pulse rates were recorded with an ambulatory blood pressure monitor over 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference was recognized in patient age, gender, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure before treatment between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the cilnidipine groups, no difference in average 24-hour or waking systolic blood pressure values was seen between cerebrovascular disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) subjects and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects, although in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2668">amlodipine</z:chebi> groups, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects had significantly higher blood pressure values than non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cilnidipine group, the coefficient of variation values of pulse rate were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects than in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a Ca <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> with no sympathetic nerve suppression had weaker blood pressure-lowering effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased pulse rate variability, shown in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> subjects administered cilnidipine, suggests that cilnidipine enhanced the parasympathetic function in hypertensive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
