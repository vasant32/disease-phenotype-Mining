<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials have been widely interpreted as demonstrating that combined menopausal hormone therapy (HT) fails to protect against-and may increase-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in menopausal women, regardless of whether initiated early in the menopause or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This conclusion does not agree with results of large epidemiological studies showing protection by HT and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement alone (ET) against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One possible reason for this inconsistency is that the epidemiologic data are confounded by "healthy user bias." Another possible explanation is that most women in the observational studies initiated ET or HT at or near the menopausal transition, at which point there is little or no arterial injury, whereas, in the WHI studies, older women, averaging approximately 12 years postmenopausal, many of whom would have had significant asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Substantial data demonstrate atheropreventive effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> before vascular damage occurs, whereas adverse effects of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> may predominate once complex atheromas are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> observed in older WHI women treated with oral conjugated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> could be due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thromboses</z:e> (multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the uncertain relevance of the WHI (and other published randomized clinical trials) to initiation of HT in perimenopausal women, and its subsequent continuation for atheroprevention, new trials will be needed to resolve whether early intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> may prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kronos Early <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> Prevention Study (KEEPS), which began in mid-2005, is a randomized, controlled multicenter trial of HT in recently menopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It will examine surrogate end points as well as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
