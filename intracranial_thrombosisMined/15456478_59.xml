<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is increasingly used as an alternative to FEIBA; however, the thrombotic safety profile of rFVIIa remains incompletely characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence rates of thrombotic adverse events (AEs) after infusion of rFVIIa and FEIBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from the MedWatch pharmacovigilance program of the US Food and Drug Administration, as supplemented by published case reports, were used in conjunction with estimated numbers of infusions available from manufacturers to assess comparative incidence of thrombotic AEs in patients receiving rFVIIa or FEIBA in the period from April 1999 through June 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reported thrombotic AEs were rare, with incidence rates of 24.6 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 19.1-31.2 per 10(5) infusions) for rFVIIa and 8.24 per 10(5) infusions (CI, 4.71-13.4 per 10(5) infusions) for FEIBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic AEs were significantly more frequent in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients (incidence rate ratio, 2.98; CI, 1.71-5.52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most commonly documented single type of thrombotic AE after rFVIIa infusion was cerebrovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> was the most frequent type in patients receiving FEIBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrasting AE reporting patterns between rFVIIa and FEIBA may have contributed to the observed difference in thrombotic event incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this comprehensive pharmacovigilance assessment does not support superior thrombotic safety of rFVIIa and suggests that thrombotic AE risk may be higher in rFVIIa than FEIBA recipients </plain></SENT>
