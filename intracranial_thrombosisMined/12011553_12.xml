<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A follow-up of symptomatic CVDST admitted to Portuguese hospitals since 1980 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one patients (retrospective cases) were re-evaluated during 1996; 91 consecutively admitted patients from 6/1995 to 6/1998 were followed up to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 1996, 4 (8%) of the retrospective cases had died (3 patients died in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase), 4 (8%) could not be reached, 33 (64%) had recovered completely (Rankin 0 or 1) and 3 (6%) were dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prospective cases had a mean follow-up of 1 year: 6 (7%) patients died in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, one (1%) died during follow-up, 75 (82%) recovered completely, and only 1 (1%) was dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the prospective cases, worsening after admission (OR = 18.2; 95% CI = 2.9-112.4) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> as the presenting syndrome (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 1.2-40.9) predicted <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency, while absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> (OR 6.7, 95% CI = 1.6-33) and no worsening after admission (OR = 5.9; 95% CI = 1.6-20) predicted total recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up of the prospective cases, 4 (5%) patients had thrombotic events, 8 (10%) patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 9 (11%) complained of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and 1 patient suffered severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-term functional prognosis of patients with CVDST was fairly good with complete recovery in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these patients had a moderate risk of further thrombotic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
