<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Giant or large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> are the vascular neurosurgeon's greatest challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At our department, we have treated one hundred and thirty nine patients with giant or large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> between 1975 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These included 37 partially thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>75 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were giant (&gt; 2.5 cm) and 64 were large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (2-2.5 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional computed tomography angiograms were performed in patients besides MRI angiography and digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were found to be very valuable in the preoperative assessment of surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with respect to the branch arteries and perforators origin besides knowing the relations to the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With our experience in surgical treatment of these 139 cases, we find that the basic technique is trapping and evacuation and not just clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck but also reconstruction of the artery bearing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, especially with wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Use of multiple clipping, tandem clipping or dome clipping as per the intraoperative situation, is very helpful in dealing with giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as also is the use of different types of clips like fenestrated clip with straight clip (combination clipping), booster clip, dome clips etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While selecting surgical strategy for partially thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, securing the neck is most important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If the neck is too narrow to reconstruct, aneurysmectomy with anastomosis is one of the surgical strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An extracranial intracranial bypass should be considered in cases where clipping or parent artery ligation is expected to be associated with compromise of cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
