<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Nonaneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) accounts for 15% to 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its prognosis may vary from complete recovery to different and serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a series of cases with nonaneurysmal SAHs, their clinical and tomographic characteristics and causes as well as long term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 50 patients diagnosed of SAH and two negative brain angiographies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were followed-up for an average period of 62 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The demographic data of importance, vascular risk factors, were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were evaluated during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase with the Hunt and Hess clinical scale and Fisher topographic scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was listed as absent, perimesencephalic, focal, ventricular or diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presence of rebleeding, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the functional course, measured by the Rankin modified scale, were recorded during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to this scale, Rankin of 0 to 2 was considered as a favorable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This series represents 8.6 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the SAH cases in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 6 cases (12%), there was a causal relationship between the use of sympathicomimetic drugs and the development of SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 80% of them, it was not possible to document the cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, while difference causes )<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in 4 [8%], spontaneous dissection of the vertebral artery in 2 [4%], <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> secondary to neurocystecerosis in 2 [4%], cavernous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in 1 [2%] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002390'>spinal arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> in 1) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding did not occur in any of the cases and only one patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In 45 patients (90%), the final functional prognosis was good (Rankin 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We found no significant differences between the tomographic pattern of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, initial clinical condition and long term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show a low frequency of nonaneurysmal SAH in our population and a diversity of causes greater than those reported by other series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The good functional prognosis in these cases was confirmed </plain></SENT>
