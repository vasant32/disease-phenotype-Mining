<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we tested the hypothesis of an in vivo proapoptotic role of HIF-1alpha after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, HIF-1alpha and procaspase-3 mRNA and protein expressions were examined in rat brain subjected to 12- and 24-h permanent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the presence of an HIF-1 binding activity to the caspase-3 gene promoter was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that HIF-1alpha and procaspase-3 expressions increased with a similar pattern in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, caspase-3 activation was observed in cells that express HIF-1alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, electrophoretic mobility assay revealed a specific HIF-1 binding activity to the caspase-3 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altogether the present data provide strong arguments for a causative relationship between HIF-1alpha and caspase-3 inductions through a functional binding activity to the caspase-3 gene promoter </plain></SENT>
