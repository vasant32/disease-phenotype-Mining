<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present data concerning the extraction of clots using the newly invented "GP" mechanical thrombectomy device (MTD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Artificial and porcine clots of various lengths were used in plastic tube models of an artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigate the pressures and times taken for clot extraction together with the volumes of fluid extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigate the impact of using a funnel structure mounted on the end of the device, on clot removal times and fluid removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, we present results involving clot extraction from the posterior popliteal artery of a cadaver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicated that: The embedded GP MTD is the most effective device regarding artificial and porcine blood clot removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with previous published data on this device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The GP MTD was effective in removing clots positioned in the posterior popliteal artery of a cadaver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The embedded GP device removes less fluid compared with the end-mounted GP device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This confirms previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There appears to be a relationship between funnel angle and pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lower extraction pressures are required for larger funnel angles mounted on the GP device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Shorter times of clot extraction are required for larger funnel angles </plain></SENT>
