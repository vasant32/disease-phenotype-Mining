<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> has been one of the most important means to examine the function of the vestibulo-oculomotor system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Especially in Japan, it has been used as a mean to analyze the function of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated directional preponderance of the optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> in supratentorial lesions especially unilateral lesions, in the cerebral hemisphere which had been nearly neglected as an object for investigation of the vestibular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined 30 cases of unilateral lesion in the cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases CT-scan confirmed that these lesions have no mass effect which might affect the function of the surrounding brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was also confirmed that these cases had no spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases consisted of 11 cerebral infarctions, 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo> and 4 cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the result, 27 cases showed directional preponderance of the optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> to the ipsilateral side, while there was none to the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three cases showed no directional preponderance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some cases showed marked inhibition of optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> of the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These markedly inhibited cases are very similar to cases of pontine lesion which usually manifest marked inhibition of the optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> to the ipsilateral side </plain></SENT>
