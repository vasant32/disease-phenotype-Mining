<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To describe preliminary experiences and the procedural details of retrieval thrombectomy using a self-expanding and fully retrievable Solitaire stent (ev 3 Inc., CA, USA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) patients with large <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with AIS were treated by mechanical thrombectomy using a self-expanding, fully retrievable stent (Solitaire, ev 3 Inc., CA, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stent was deployed to cover the whole intra-arterial clot and then it was slowly retrieved while occluding the internal cerebral artery (ICA) with a balloon guiding catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, continuous negative pressure was applied through the balloon guiding catheter with a specially designed gun device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occlusion sites were M1 in six cases including one combined supraclinoid ICA occlusion and the other combined M2 occlusion, M2 in 1 case and one basilar artery top </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete recanalization was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedure time was 45 min or less in seven cases and 70 min in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Distal emboli occurred in one case in which the balloon guide catheter was not used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only in this case was intraarterial fibrinolytics infusion necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no post-operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, retrieval thrombectomy with the Solitaire stent was a simple and effective method for reopening large cerebral arteries in AIS patients </plain></SENT>
