<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Given that women have demonstrated a greater margin of benefit than men from treatment with thrombolytics in certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials, the current study explored whether this sex effect extends to mechanical embolectomy and can be explained by revascularization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study included the 305 patients enrolled in the Mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> Removal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral Ischemia</z:hpo> (MERCI) and Multi MERCI trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, risk factor, and procedural characteristics were evaluated in women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for outcomes by sex were compared in patients with revascularization and those without revascularization, defined as a Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> score of 2-3 at the end of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes included a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 and mortality at 90 days, as well as the presence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (sICH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient and procedural characteristics did not differ between women and men except for mean age (women, 70.1 years; men, 64.8 years; P = .003), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (women, 78.0%; men, 65.5%; P = .021), and number of vertebrobasilar occlusions (women, 8/159 [5.0%]; men, 20/146 [13.7%]; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was significantly associated with favorable outcomes in both women and men (P &lt; .0001), and rates of favorable outcome, mortality, and sICH did not differ between women and men when the vessel was revascularized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Likewise, mechanical embolectomy with the Merci Retriever was not associated with different outcomes in women and men when the vessel was revascularized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the sex differences seen in thrombolytic trials might be due to factors other than immediate postprocedural large vessel opening </plain></SENT>
