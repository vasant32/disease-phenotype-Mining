<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> due to occlusion of perforating branches were excluded from the study, to equalize the size of the involved arteries in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 60% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> showed a level of consciousness lower than stupor, while less than 15% did so in the thrombotic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical signs such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo>, conjugate deviation, etc., were more frequently seen in the embolic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mean size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on CT (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath>-Index) was significantly larger, and a shift of the midline structure was more frequently noticed in the embolic group than in the thrombotic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> showed more unfavorable outcome than those with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperdense area developed in 40% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> during the period of observation, while in only 2% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of the attack was very common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-four percent experienced more than two episodes of cerebral and/or systemic embolization; of these recurrences 51% (27% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases) occurred within 2 weeks before and/or after the present episode that caused the admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The importance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> as the source of emboli was reemphasized </plain></SENT>
