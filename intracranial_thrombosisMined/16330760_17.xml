<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The amyloid beta-protein precursor (AbetaPP) is best known as the parent molecule to the amyloid beta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that accumulates in the brains of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Secreted isoforms of AbetaPP that contain the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor domain are analogous to the previously identified cell-secreted proteinase inhibitor known as protease nexin-2 (PN2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although PN2/AbetaPP is enriched in brain and in circulating blood platelets, little is understood of its physiological function and potential role in disease processes outside of amyloid beta-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the potent inhibition of certain procoagulant proteinases by PN2/AbetaPP, coupled with its abundance in platelets and brain, indicate that it may function to regulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we show that specific and modest 2-fold overexpression of PN2/AbetaPP in circulating platelets of transgenic mice caused a marked inhibition of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, deletion of PN2/AbetaPP in AbetaPP gene knockout mice resulted in a significant increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, platelet PN2/AbetaPP transgenic mice developed larger <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, whereas AbetaPP gene knockout mice exhibited reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that PN2/AbetaPP plays a significant role in regulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and that modest increases in this protein can profoundly enhance <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
