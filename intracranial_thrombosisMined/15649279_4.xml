<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals at 5 weeks of age were separated into four groups: (i) control group; (ii) vitamin E group, which was given 1000 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>/kg diet; (iii) sesamin group, given 1000 mg sesamin/kg diet; and (iv) vitamin E plus sesamin group, given 1000 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> plus 1000 mg sesamin/kg diet for 5 weeks from 5 to 10 weeks of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resting blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method once weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A closed cranial window was created in the right parietal bone of the rat and platelet-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were induced in vivo using a <z:chebi fb="64" ids="30217">helium</z:chebi>-neon laser technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of laser pulses required for formation of an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was used as an index of thrombotic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control rats, systolic blood pressure and the amount of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) became significantly elevated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the elevation in blood pressure and 8-OHdG were significantly suppressed in rats administered vitamin E, sesamin, or vitamin E plus sesamin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 10 weeks, the number of laser pulses required to induce an occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in arterioles of the control group was significantly lower than in the other groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ingestion of vitamin E and sesamin attenuated both elevation in blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and thrombotic tendency, suggesting that these treatments might be beneficial in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
