<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The survival of viable tissue affected by secondary injury largely depends on the balance between endogenous protective mechanisms and the ongoing degenerative processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inducible enzyme, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 metabolizes and thus detoxifies free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> to the powerful endogenous <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17033">biliverdin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> therefore enhancing neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35788">secosteroid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17823">1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3</z:chebi> (1,25-D3) is a modulator of the immune system and also exhibits a strong potential for neuroprotection as recently shown in the MCAO model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of 1,25-D3 treatment on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 expression following focal cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> elicited by photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postlesional treatment with 1,25-D3 (4 microg/kg body weight) resulted in a transient, but significant upregulation of glial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 immunoreactivity concomitant with a reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in remote cortical regions affected by a secondary spread of injury, whereas the size of the lesion's core remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1,25-D3 did not produce a temporal shift or extension of injury-related <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 responses, indicating that 1,25-D3 did not prolong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to glial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 upregulation, glial fibrillary acidic protein, a sensitive marker for reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings support an additional protective action of 1,25-D3 at the cellular level in regions affected by secondary injury-related responses </plain></SENT>
