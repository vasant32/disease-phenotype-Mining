<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether BSF468248 is effective against focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we evaluated the change of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and infarction volume using a photochemically-induced cortical vein occlusion model in rats in blind studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 22 Wistar rats, two adjacent cortical veins were occluded by photochemical <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and fiberoptic illumination under controlled anesthesia and ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Just after the occlusion, BSF468248 or physiological saline was administrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the low-dose study, a treatment group (n = 7) was administered BSF468248 1 mg/kg bolus and 1 mg/kg continuously for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The same volume of saline was given to a vehicle group (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the high-dose study, a treatment group (n = 5) was administrated BSF468248 1 mg/kg bolus and 12 mg/kg continuously for 180 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same volume of saline was given to a vehicle group (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the experiment, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in both the low-dose study (120 min) and the high-dose study (180 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the experiment, the animals were killed in order to evaluate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rCBF at the end of the experiment showed a similar decrease in both the low-dose study (at 120 min: treatment group: 66.5 +/- 10.2%; vehicle group: 69.3 +/- 10.2%) and the high-dose study (at 180 min: treatment group: 62.1 +/- 7.5%; vehicle group: 65.1 +/- 12.3%), with no significant differences (t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume also showed no significant difference in either group of the low-dose study (treatment group: 3.46 +/- 0.84 mm3; vehicle group: 3.56 +/- 1.40 mm3) or the high-dose study (treatment group: 2.27 +/- 0.43 mm3; vehicle group: 1.76 +/- 0.31 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our study found that BSF468248 is not effective in improving the rCBF and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
