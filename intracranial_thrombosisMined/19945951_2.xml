<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD), who are known to have abnormalities in coagulation and platelet function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who consecutively received intravenous thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at our hospital from 2005-2009 (n = 74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alteplase was administered to patients deemed eligible by National Institute of Health criteria per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied associations between admission <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60ml/min/1.73 m(2)] and in-hospital outcomes: intracranial haemorrhage (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), poor functional status (modified Rankin score 3-6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- SD age was 66.4 +/- 16.9 years with 39 (52.7%) men and 46 (62.2%) Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (27.0%) had eGFR &lt;60 and were older, with a higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> than patients with eGFR &gt; or =60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, blood pressure and time to alteplase were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> occurred in two patients with eGFR &gt; or =60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> considered together showed no difference in these event rates (20% in eGFR &lt;60 vs 11.1% in eGFR &gt; or =60, P = 0.321) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in poor functional status (70.0% in eGFR &lt;60 vs 57.4% in eGFR &gt; or =60, P = 0.324) or in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> outcomes (10.0% in eGFR &lt;60 vs 7.4% in eGFR &gt; or =60, P = 0.717) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed no association between eGFR &lt;60 and in-hospital outcomes, while increasing age was associated with poor functional status [odds ratio 1.03 (1.00-1.06, P = 0.047)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our limited sample size study, presence of eGFR &lt;60 in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was not found to be associated with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, poor functional outcome or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that use of thrombolytics in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is appropriate in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
