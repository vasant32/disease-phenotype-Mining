<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors introduce the azygos anterior cerebral artery (ACA) bypass as an option for revascularizing distal ACA territories, as part of a strategy to trap giant anterior communicating artery (ACoA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this procedure, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is exposed with an orbitozygomatic-pterional craniotomy and distal ACA vessels are exposed with a bifrontal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The uninvolved contralateral A(2) segment of the ACA serves as a donor vessel for a short radial artery graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contralateral pericallosal artery (PcaA) and the callosomarginal artery (CmaA) are connected to the graft in the interhemispheric fissure using the double reimplantation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three anastomoses create an azygos system supplying the entire ACA territory, enabling the surgeon to trap the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> incompletely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retrograde flow from the CmaA supplies the ipsilateral recurrent artery of Heubner, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> lumen thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The azygos bypass was successfully performed to treat a 47-year-old woman with a giant, thrombotic ACoA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> supplied by the A(1) segment of the left ACA, with left PcaA and CmaA originating from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the azygos ACA bypass is a novel option for revascularizing PcaA and CmaA, as part of the overall treatment of giant ACoA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
