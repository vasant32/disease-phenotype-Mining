<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the common 4G/5G polymorphism in the promoter of the PAI-1 gene was suggested to be a risk factor for some of the thrombotic disorders, its significance in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents the data on a total of 357 patients with different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 281 unrelated healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that the 4G/4G genotype is associated with a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into five distinct groups according to the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes were associated with a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> development in a group of 69 patients with internal organ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (OR, 6.35; 95% CI, 2.5-16.1 and OR, 4.85; 95% CI, 2.0-12.1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this association was even stronger in a subgroup of 33 patients with portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (PVT) and 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes conferred more than 10- and 6-fold increases in the risk of developing PVT (95% CI: 2.3-47.1 and 1.4-28.8), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant association was found between 4G/4G genotype and the groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (126 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (80 patients), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (72 patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> fulminans (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A mutations did not emerge as additional risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in any of the groups studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To conclude, this study suggests that there may be an association between 4G/4G and 4G/5G genotypes and the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in vessels of internal organs especially in the portal veins </plain></SENT>
