<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolism</z:hpo> is one of the most serious complications in coil embolization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, and antiplatelet premedication may reduce this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, interindividual variation exists in the efficacy of CPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to elucidate the clinical implications of preinterventional CPG response variability in patients who undergo coil embolization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: CPG premedication was given to 186 consecutive patients with 209 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who underwent elective coil embolization, and the response to the premedication was measured by a point-of-care antiplatelet function test (VerifyNow assay) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into 4 quartiles according the test results, and their correlation with the occurrence of periprocedural complications was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The contribution of a variety of variables to the high PRU was also tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this cohort, rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> adverse events were 7.5% and 9.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The quartiles of the P2Y12 reaction unit of the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> channel (PRU) showed a significant tendency toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (P = .013) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedure-related adverse events (P = .009), while those of the BASE and percentage inhibition did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>Thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred in 17.0% and procedure-related adverse events, in 21.3% of the patients in the fourth quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Female sex was the only significant factor related to the fourth quartile of PRU in the multiple logistic regression analysis (P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Procedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in patients in the upper quartile with higher PRU, especially in the fourth quartile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study including a large number of patients is expected to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
