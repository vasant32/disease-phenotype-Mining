<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Length of stay (LOS) is the main cost-determining factor of hospitalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to derive and validate a simple score for the assessment of the risk of prolonged LOS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients in a national setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) patients in the National <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Israeli Surveys (NASIS 2004 and 2007) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predictors of prolonged LOS (LOS &gt; or =7 days) in the NASIS 2004 (n = 1,700) were identified with logistic regression analysis and used for the derivation of the Prolonged Length of Stay (PLOS) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The score was validated in the NASIS 2007 (n = 1,648) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) LOS was 6 (3-10) days in the derivation cohort (42.3% prolonged LOS) and 5 (3-8) in the validation cohort (35.7% prolonged LOS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The derivation cohort included 54.8% men, 90.8% IS and 9.2% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, with a mean (SD) age of 71.2 (12.5) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity was the strongest multivariable predictor of prolonged LOS: odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) increased from 2.6 (2.0-3.3) for NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (NIHSS) 6-10 to 4.9 (3.0-8.0) for NIHSS 16-20, compared with NIHSS &lt; or =5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity and type, decreased level of consciousness on admission, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> were used for the derivation of the PLOS score (c statistics 0.692, 95% CI 0.666-0.718) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The score performed similarly well in the validation cohort (c statistics 0.680, 95% CI 0.653-0.707) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A simple prolonged length of stay score, based on available baseline information, may be useful for tailoring policy aimed at better use of resources and optimal discharge planning of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
