<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is an infrequent variety of cerebrovascular disease with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and a notoriously difficult diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have emphasized the potential clinical utility of D-dimer assay in CVT diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A rapid sensitive D-dimer assay was performed at entry in 73 patients with CVT &lt;30 days duration, examined in our institution between 1999 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean value of D-dimer levels was 1521 ng/mL; 7 patients (10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 26% of those presenting with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>) had values &lt;500 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was the only variable associated with a negative D-dimer assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A negative D-Dimer assay does not confidently rule out CVT, particularly in the setting of recent isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
