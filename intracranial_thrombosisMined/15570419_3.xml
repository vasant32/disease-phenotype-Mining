<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of three patients diagnosed with dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (DAVF) and cortical venous reflux (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated by transarterial endovascular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Residual shunting and cortical venous drainage continued to be present at the end of the treatment procedure, despite the fact that during endovascular embolization glue penetration into the proximal venous component of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> had been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, follow-up angiography showed total obliteration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and absent associated CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were no longer opacified, and no additional treatment was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that residual aggressive DAVF may progress to total <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> if strategic deposition of the glue into the venous side has been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early follow-up angiogram is recommended prior to a planned complementary surgical approach </plain></SENT>
