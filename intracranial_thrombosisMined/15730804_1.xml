<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Samples of venous blood were collected from 1634 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, lacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> confirmed by CT or MRI, and sex-, and age-matched 1171 controls without cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined with polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific restriction enzyme analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the THBS-1 gene 1678 AA genotype (0.503 vs. 0.441) was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> group than in the controls (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the G allele (0.299 vs. 0.339) was significantly lower in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> group than in the controls (P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen in THBS-1 gene 1678 AA polymorphism either between the lacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> group and the control group or between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> group and the control group (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the AA genotype of THBS-1 gene G1678A carriers had a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (OR: 1.4; 95% CI 1.083 - 1.693; P = 0.008) after adjustment for age, sex, SBP, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, BMI, smoking, TC, TG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> and Glu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AA genotypes in THBS-1 gene G1678A polymorphism may be a genetic risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in Chinese population </plain></SENT>
