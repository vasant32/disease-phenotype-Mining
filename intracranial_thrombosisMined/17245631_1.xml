<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an uncommon condition with many clinical manifestations, and hereditary prothrombotic conditions such as factor Leiden V, deficiency of protein S, protein C and antithrombin III, as well as prothrombin gene mutation, may account for 10-15% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, conflicting results have been reported for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the patients with factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation, since some studies have shown a higher risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in carriers of these two mutations than in non-carriers, and the last study showed higher risk only for carriers of double defect (homozygous or double heterozygous for this mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case report is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report a case of cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as a recurrent thrombotic event in a patient with heterozygous prothrombin G20210A genotype after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Since many facts are controversial, the use of secondary prophylaxis for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in these patients is still a matter of debate without clear consensus recommendation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data on the risk of recurrent thrombotic events in thrombophilic patient is insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="?"><plain>The main unclear question concerning these patients is: how long and whom should we treat with long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy as secondary prophylaxis of DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The problem for practitioner is that we do not have guidelines and precise recommendations for secondary thromboprophylaxis in this or similar cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case is remarkable for its favorable and quick outcome and its rarity, because CSVT is an uncommon condition and heterozygous prothrombin G20210A genotype was only found predisposing factor for CSVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies of risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004850'>recurrent venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with heterozygous prothrombin G20210A genotype with the larger sample size are required </plain></SENT>
