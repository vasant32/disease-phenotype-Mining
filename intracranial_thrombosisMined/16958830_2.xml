<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> induced by the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> enoxaparin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: Three female patients were treated initially with direct intrasinus urokinase, and then followed by low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (LMWH) enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg given subcutaneously twice daily for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was switched to oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> at 5 mg daily for another 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nearly 3 weeks after the initiation of anticoagulation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the three patients complained of excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo> with large areas of patchy, non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hair growth returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 1 month after the completion of enoxaparin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> remains the first-line treatment of CVT because of its efficacy, safety and feasibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>Alopecia</z:hpo> has been reported as a side effect of LMWHs dalteparin and tinzaparin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263518" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">telogen effluvium</z:e>, involves the induction of the hair follicle into a resting phase without apparent pathologic implication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, this article also reviewed other medications taken by the patients that are possibly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: From the review of literature, there is no report of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> caused by urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the Naranjo ADR Probability Scale, a score of 6 suggests that enoxaparin was the probable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> in our three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This report introduces evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> as a probable side effect of enoxaparin, but stresses the efficacy and safety of LMWH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As this is not a life-threatening disorder, we hope to increase the awareness of pharmacists and clinicians to this relatively rare but important side effect </plain></SENT>
