<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a novel miniaturized confocal laser scanning probe for in vivo visualization of blood vessels, blood flow, cell tracking and perfusion in both healthy rodents and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease models</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The hand-held confocal microscopy system allowed a 500- to 2,400-fold magnification at a dynamically variable imaging depth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different intravital stains were used alone or in combination for tissue, nuclear, plasma and vascular endothelial cell staining and for blood flow visualization, and targeted staining for individual cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Precision optical sectioning yielded high-resolution images in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leucocyte-endothelium interactions in brain microvasculature were followed in serial sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A microthrombosis was identified after sequential injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-labelled erythrocytes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and acriflavine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Glomerular alterations were visualized in the MRL/lprmouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000123'>nephritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Intravital confocal microscopy with a miniaturized hand-held probe combines high-resolution subsurface imaging in real time for dynamic visualization of vessels, cells, blood flow and associated pathologies, permitting a truly comprehensive vascular imaging in vivo at the cellular level </plain></SENT>
