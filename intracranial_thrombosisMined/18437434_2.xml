<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the role of CT scan as the primary modality of imaging in suspected cases of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between October 2006 and September 2007, 53 patients, suspected to have CVT, underwent CT scan of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 33 patients were included in the study, who underwent non-contrast CT (NCCT), CT venous angiogram (MDCTA) and magnetic resonance venogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two blinded readers evaluated the NCCT and MDCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Final diagnosis was obtained after consensus reading of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the imaging by the two readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of the total 33 patients, 20 patients were detected to have <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of one or more of the cerebral venous sinuses or veins, at the concluding consensus reading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MDCTA together with NCCT could identify <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 20 patients, i.e., 100% sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four-slice MDCTA together with NCCT provided 100% sensitivity and specificity for the identification of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It can be considered as a cost-effective and widely available, primary imaging modality in emergency situations </plain></SENT>
