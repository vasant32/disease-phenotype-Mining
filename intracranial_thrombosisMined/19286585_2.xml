<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low cholesterol level is known to be associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the associations of hemorrhagic transformation (HTf) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and the low levels of total cholesterol (TC) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi>) are largely undiscovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 1034 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who were consecutively admitted to our hospital, 377 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to large artery atherothrombosis (LAA; n=210) or cardioembolism (n=167) were selected for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical information was collected and HTf was evaluated through follow-up T2*-weighted gradient-echo MRI performed usually within 1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurement of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters included TC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 377 patients, HTf was noted in 74 patients (19.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When patients were divided into 4 groups according to their TC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi> levels, the incidence of HTf was significantly elevated in the lowest quartile of each TC (P&lt;0.01) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) level in LAA subgroup, but not in cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting covariates, a low level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi> (OR, 0.46 per 1 mmol/L-increase; 95% CI, 0.22-0.98) was independently associated with HTf in LAA, but not in cardioembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between low levels of TC (OR, 0.63 per 1 mmol/L-increase; 95% CI, 0.35-1.15) and HTf in LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDLC</z:chebi>, and possibly TC, are associated with greater risk of hemorrhagic transformation after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributable to LAA </plain></SENT>
