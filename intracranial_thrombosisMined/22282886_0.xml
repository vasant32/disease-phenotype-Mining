<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We elucidated whether MDCT-detected AAD is associated with an increased risk of early ischemic lesion recurrence on diffusion-weighted MRI after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> confirmed using diffusion-weighted MRI who were hospitalized within 48 hours after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and underwent MDCT were identified in a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AAD on MDCT was defined as the presence of plaque formation that was noncalcified and ≥4 mm thick, ulcerative, or soft and thrombosed (vulnerable) in the proximal aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesion recurrence on diffusion-weighted MRI was defined as the occurrence of any new lesion separate from the index lesion on follow-up diffusion-weighted MRI performed within 14 days after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 138 patients was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MDCT detected AAD in 24 of 138 (17.4%); ≥4 mm thickness in 17 of 138 (12.3%); ulcerated plaque in 20 of 138 (14.5%); and vulnerable plaque in 16 of 138 (11.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With respect to diffusion-weighted MRI lesion recurrence, the crude ORs (95% CIs) were as follows: AAD, 3.56 (1.43-8.89); vulnerable plaque, 3.21 (1.11-9.30); ulcerated plaque, 3.37 (1.27-8.95); and ≥4 mm thickness of the noncalcified plaque, 4.23 (1.11-16.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results remained significant after adjustments for potential confounders were made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that AAD detected by MDCT increases the risk of early ischemic lesion recurrence after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, thus supporting the role of MDCT in diagnosing AAD and assessing its contribution to recurrence </plain></SENT>
