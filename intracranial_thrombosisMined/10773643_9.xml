<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar artery (BA) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been shown to reduce mortality and avoid a fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical outcome following intra-arterial fibrinolysis of occlusions of the BA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records and neuroradiologic results of 20 consecutive patients who had intra-arterial fibrinolysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions of the BA between 1982 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed neurologically for a period of up to 12 years, including assessment of the Barthel index (BI) and brain CT or MRI studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of treatment, 6 patients were somnolent and 14 comatose, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> was present in 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and treatment ranged from 1 to 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 35% (7/20 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was excellent in 9, 78%, of 13 survivors (BI &lt;85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the cumulative follow-up period (125 patient years) there was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular events during follow-up were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 3) and a single cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that our series was biased towards patients with severe symptoms, 65% (13/20) survived, and 78% of the survivors reached independence in daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that local fibrinolysis of BA occlusion reduces mortality, and the long-term prognosis of the survivors is better than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of our patients had a further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up period, which indicates that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion is not a strong indicator for advanced arteriosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
