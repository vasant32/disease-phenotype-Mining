<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with AF is not always attributable to embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of the risk of embolic versus atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> should lead to the optimal individualized management of patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HYPOTHESIS: The goal of the study was to determine the relation between cortical infarction and perforating infarction and TEE findings in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated the clinical usefulness of TEE in the risk stratification of clinical subtyping of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> which were divided into two territories of the cortical branch (cortical infarction due to embolism) and deep perforators (perforating infarction due to atherothrombosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast, peak flow velocity in the left atrial appendage, and generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as estimated by the intima-media wall thickness of the thoracic aorta were assessed by TEE in 118 consecutive patients with either paroxysmal (n = 44) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n = 74) AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent either brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cortical and perforating infarction was found in 39 and 18% of patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The grade of spontaneous echo contrast was higher in patients with than in those without cortical infarction (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with perforating infarction showed significant increase in the aortic wall thickness when compared with patients without perforating infarction (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, multivariate logistic analysis revealed that spontaneous echo contrast was an independent predictor of cortical infarction, while intima-media wall thickness of the aorta, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and age were useful in predicting the risk of perforating infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transesophageal echocardiography has a potential role in the risk stratification for cortical and perforating infarction in patients with AF </plain></SENT>
