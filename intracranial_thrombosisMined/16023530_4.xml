<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate imaging findings, risk factors and outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with diagnosis of CVT between 1992 and 2002 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011450'>CNS infection</z:hpo> and with CVT secondary to invasive procedures were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inherited and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> were searched in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (18 women, 6 men) with mean age of 29.5 years (range 3-48 years) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 44 months (range 11-145 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (75%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (33%) and impairment of consciousness (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Probable causes of CVT could be determined in 21 (88%) patients: pregnancy or puerperium in six (25%), oral contraceptive use in four (17%), head trauma in two (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> in one (4%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> in one (4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> in three (13%), and inherited thrombotic risk factors in four (17%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CVT associated with pregnancy, puerperium and use of oral contraceptives had a significant better outcome than CVT caused by inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> (OR=14.4; p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT scans were abnormal in 15 (62.5%) patients and MRI with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> was abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Those with parenchymal involvement had neurological sequelae during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi>, and none had new or worsening of pre-existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI is superior to conventional CT for diagnosing CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with parenchymal lesions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> had greater risk to be left with neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy did not predispose to further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
