<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 1982 report (J <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Dis 1982;35:703-14) that a relatively high white blood cell (WBC) count predicted increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> could not establish whether this association was independent of smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors examined data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, conducted in 1971-1987, to assess WBC count as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a sample of the US population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White men with a WBC count of &gt; 8,100 cells/mm3 had a 39% increase in age-adjusted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence compared with those with a WBC count of &lt; 6,600 cells/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, controlling for cigarette smoking reduced the association and rendered it statistically nonsignificant (relative risk = 1.26, 95% confidence interval 0.93-1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant associations of WBC count with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence were seen in white women or in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In white men, elevated WBC count may be a mediator of cardiovascular effects of smoking, an indicator of smoking exposure, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate mechanisms for the effect of smoking and WBC count on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
