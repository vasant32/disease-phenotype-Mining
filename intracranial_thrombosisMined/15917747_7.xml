<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to visualize developing vessel occlusion in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cortical photothrombosis (PT) was induced in rats, which in addition received superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> (SPIO) particles intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When SPIO particles were applied simultaneously during illumination of the brain for induction of PT, animals showed a markedly hypointense cortical lesion on T2-weighted (T2-w) magnetic-resonance images (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 h after PT, this hypointense area was surrounded by a small hyperintense rim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 48 h after PT the hyperintense rim had further extended, whereas the hypointense lesion core did not change in size or signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On histological sections areas of signal loss on T2-w MRI corresponded to local accumulation of iron particles, which were trapped within vessel <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When SPIO particles were applied at 2 h after PT, the lesion appeared hyperintense on T2-w MRI, but was surrounded by a small hypointense rim indicating ongoing vessel occlusion at its outer margins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, delayed SPIO application at 24 h after completion of PT produced a merely hyperintense cortical lesion on T2-w MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, no iron deposits were seen on tissue sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, early SPIO-enhanced MRI provides a reliable in vivo tool to delineate areas of developing vessel occlusion in experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and identifies vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as one mechanism of secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth in the PT paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This new imaging technique may aid to evaluate antithrombotic treatment strategies in the future </plain></SENT>
