<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 5-year case-control study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish hospitals was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women 15-44 years old, suffering a first ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> (PE) during the period January 1, 1994, to December 30, 1998, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were selected annually, 600 per year in 1994-1995 and 1200 per year 1996-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response rates for cases and controls were 87.2% and 89.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of nonvalid diagnoses, pregnant women, and women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic disease</z:e>, 987 cases and 4054 controls were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate, matched analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controls were matched to cases within 1-year age bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustment was made for confounding influence (if any) from the following variables: age, year, body mass index, length of OC use, family history of VTE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, years of schooling, and previous birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of VTE among current users of OCs was primarily influenced by duration of use, with significantly decreasing odds ratios (OR) over time: &lt;1 year, 7.0 (5.1-9.6); 1-5 years, 3.6 (2.7-4.8); and &gt;5 years, 3.1 (2.5-3.8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> compared with nonusers of OCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounders, current use of OCs with second- (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>) and third- (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi> or gestodene) generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> when compared with nonuse resulted in ORs for VTE of 2.9 (2.2-3.8) and 4.0 (3.2-4.9), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi> types and length of use, the risk decreased significantly with decreasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With 30-40 microg as reference, 20 and 50 microg products implied ORs of 0.6 (0.4-0.9) and 1.6 (0.9-2.8), respectively (p(trend) = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After correction for duration of use and differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose, the third/second-generation risk ratio was 1.3 (1.0-1.8; p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, use of OCs was associated significantly to the risk of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The risk among current users was reduced by more than 50% during the first years of use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The risk increased more than 100% with increasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose, and the difference in risk between users of third- and second-generation OCs, after correction for length of use and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose, was 33% </plain></SENT>
