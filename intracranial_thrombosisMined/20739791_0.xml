<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aims : To identify possible inherited and acquired prothrombotic risk factors and also identify the factors associated with mortality in pregnancy associated CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective cohort study to identify prothrombotic risk factors and case control study of influence of local traditional practice of puerperal water restriction on postpartum CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with pregnancy associated CVT seen over a period of three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic workup included genetic markers, protein assays, and other factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Univariate and chi-square analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results: Of the 41 patients studied during the study period, 71% of patient had a single and 34% had multiple prothrombotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">Methylene</z:chebi> tetrahydro-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) heterozygosity (19.5%) and factor V Leiden heterozygous (7.3%) were the commonest genetic markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (34%) and elevated factor VIII levels (14.6%) were the other important risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this cohort the mortality was 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mortality increased by odds of 1.3 for every additional prothrombotic marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with increased mortality included: status <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptics</z:e> (P = 0.05, OR 13.2, 95% CI 1.002 - 173), deep venous system involvement (P = 0.016, OR 9.64, 95% CI 1.53 - 60.6), presence of midline shift (P = 0.012, OR 24.7, 95% CI 2.05 - 29.8) and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (P = 0.006, OR 14.5, 95% CI 2.18- 96.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The traditional practice of decrease intake of water during puerperium was significant in woman with pregnancy associated CVT when compared to control subjects (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with pregnancy associated CVT, prothrombotic markers can be multiple and are associated with increased odds of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Deep venous system involvement, presence of midline shift and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Peuperial water restriction may be a modifiable risk factor </plain></SENT>
