<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preintervention MRI patterns may be helpful in predicting prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Merci thrombectomy cases of either terminal ICA or M1 occlusions and classified them according to diffusion MRI patterns of (1) completed basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (pure M1a), (2) near-completed basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (incomplete M1a), and (3) relative sparing of deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> field (M1b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the M1a and M1b patients with respect to neurological deficit on presentation, recanalization rates, hospital length of stay, and disability on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also determined whether deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> compromise predicted hematomal hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and whether this correlated with worse clinical outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The M1a group had worse pre-Merci NIHSS (21 versus 14, P=0.004), worse discharge NIHSS (12 versus 4, P&lt;0.001), longer hospital length of stay (11.5 versus 6.4 days, P=0.003), and higher rates of discharge mRS &gt; or = 3 (OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 44.7) despite equivalent recanalization rates when compared to the M1b group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The M1a group had a higher rate of parenchymal hematomal HT (OR 6.7, 95% CI 1.02 to 183.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with such hematomal HT had higher rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency discharge (100% versus 60%, OR=infinite) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ICA and M1 occlusions, preintervention diffusion MRI evidence of advanced injury in the basal ganglia bodes worse dysfunction and disability at discharge, longer hospital stays, and higher rates of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after intervention when compared to other diffusion patterns </plain></SENT>
