<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22696">Beh</z:chebi>Ã§et's disease (BD) and to determine the patients at high risk for this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 113 patients with BD according to the international criteria for classification of BD, those with DVT were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of DVT was made in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases using conventional venous angiography, venous ultrasonography and/or thoracic or abdominal computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided in two subgroups according to the occurrence of DVT other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thromboses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medical records of these patients were reviewed in order to investigate their past medical history and evaluate their response to the treatment prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and genetic factors (HLA B51 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> 6) that might contribute to DVT were analysed by comparing patients with and without DVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of our series were compared to those of other series in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was by Chi square with necessary correction and Fischer tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients (38.9%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> of various systems with 81 localisations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 40 men and four women (mean age 28.1 years; range 17-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DVT appeared after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease with a mean delay of 3.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 6 cases, DVT revealed BD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When we evaluated the risk of DVT coexistence with other clinical findings and genetic factors (HLA B51 and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MICA</z:e> 6), we found a significant positive correlation with sex, and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our series, occurrence of DVT was significantly associated with male gender and positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878631" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pathergy</z:e> test </plain></SENT>
