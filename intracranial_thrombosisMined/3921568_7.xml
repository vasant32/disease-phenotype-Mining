<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of clinical-type high molecular weight urokinase (HMW-UK) in a single dose of 30,000-60,000 International Units (IU) in enteric-coated capsules, in a group of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human subjects, induced a plasma fibrinolytic state suggesting transport of HMW-UK across the intestinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other groups of human subjects were given a single dose of 120,000 IU daily of pure HMW-UK for 1 d and 7 d together with a placebo dose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the ingredients except urokinase (UK), daily for 7 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>UK-type proteins were isolated from the plasma of blood samples drawn 6 h after administration of the final dose, by a sequential two-step affinity chromatography method first with [N alpha-(epsilon-aminocaproyl)-DL-homoarginine hexylester]-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> and second with a specific rabbit anti-HMW-UK-IgG-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The yield of UK-type proteins from the 7-d group, 0.79 mg/dl, was approximately twofold greater than that obtained from either the placebo or 1-d groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The specific plasminogen activator activity of the 1-d and 7-d groups were similar, 508 and 537 IU/mg protein, respectively; negligible plasminogen activator activity could be detected in the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of activation parameters of human Glu-plasminogen of the UK-type protein, isolated from the 1-d group, were similar to those obtained with urinary HMW-UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The UK-type proteins isolated only from the 7-d group showed, in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, a major protein band of molecular weight 53,000 in the same position as HMW-UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, two other major protein bands of approximately 140,000 and approximately 120,000 mol wt were found in the 7-d placebo-, and 1-d groups, and also in the 7-d group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 53,000 mol wt protein, about 50% of the total protein in the 7-d group, was further purified by preparative <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, and found to be a two-chain protein with a specific activity of 1,241 IU/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protein showed common antigenic determinants with urinary HMW-UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The oral administration of 120,000 IU HMW-UK to human subjects for 7 d stimulated the synthesis of a UK-type protein of 53,000 mol wt, probably the zymogen, from either the liver or vascular endothelium, which was released into the circulation, and converted into active UK by circulating plasmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The induction of the fibrinolytic state produced the conversion of native circulating Glu-plasminogen into the degraded Lys-plasminogen form, which was found in large amounts in the plasma of the 7-d group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The new plasma components, e.g., the 53,000-mol wt UK-zymogen and Lys-plasminogen, could play an important role in clot resolution of the fibrin-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of HMW-UK has been shown to be clinically effective in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in a multicenter double blind study </plain></SENT>
