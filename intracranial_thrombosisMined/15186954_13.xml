<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous study showed that polymorphism of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase p22(phox) gene is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, although others could not confirm such association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between p22(phox) C242T polymorphism and thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and the role of this polymorphism on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-production activity in human neutrophils and promyelocytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells as a model system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PCR-RFLP analysis revealed that genotype and allele frequencies of C242T polymorphism in 120 patients with thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 177 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-production activity in neutrophils was determined by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> reduction assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of p22(phox) C242T polymorphism on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase activity, we used transgenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells transfected with expression plasmids carrying p22(phox) cDNAs with or without C242T polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Genotype and allele frequencies of C242T polymorphism in patients and control subjects were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-production activity in neutrophils with T allele was higher than in neutrophils without T allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, expression analysis showed that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi>-production activity in p22(phox) C242T-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells were significantly higher than in p22(phox)-expressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that C242T of p22(phox) gene is not involved in thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> but more likely in increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> oxidase activity in phagocytes </plain></SENT>
