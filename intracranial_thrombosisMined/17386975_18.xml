<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is increasingly recognized that they have other actions besides fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assess potential pro-inflammatory effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in rat cortical astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both uPA and tPA induced rapid dose-dependent upregulation in MMP-2 and MMP-9, as demonstrated by zymography of conditioned media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a multiplex ELISA array demonstrated that patterned responses in chemokines and cytokines were also evoked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exposure to tPA induced elevations in secreted MIP-2, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and GRO/KC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure to uPA induced elevations in secreted IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, GMCSF, MIP-1alpha, MIP-2, MIP-3alpha, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1, RANTES and fractalkine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that plasminogen activators may trigger selected pro-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> at the neurovascular interface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether these effects influence thrombolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
