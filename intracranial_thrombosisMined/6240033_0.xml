<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients chemotherapy was administered by selective catheterization of the hepatic artery via the axillary artery; it usually (31 cases) consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (60 mg/m2) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25357">mitomycin</z:chebi> (10 mg/m2) injections, and continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (1 g/24 or 72 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients (10 responders to the above method and 4 new cases), a catheter with subcutaneous chamber was implanted surgically so that chemotherapy could be continued through the chamber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood toxicity was usually moderate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main complication of injections through the catheter (114) or through the chamber (60) was <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, except for 1 lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, the others (axillary artery 3, hepatic artery 5) were unattended by functional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient biochemical signs of hepatic cytolysis were frequent after each course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hepatic insufficiency was severely aggravated in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Painful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive disorders</z:e> were relieved by symptomatic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four complete responses, 16 partial responses, 8 stabilizations and 10 failures were observed; 5 patients died soon after one single course of intra-arterial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The high response rates (greater than 50%) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006142,C0678222" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the breast</z:e> and colon, and chiefly the 3 complete responses obtained in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001883'>mammary carcinoma</z:mp> were most encouraging, bearing in mind that one of these 3 patients had not responded to intravenous chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
