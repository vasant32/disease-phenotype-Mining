<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A coated coil system named Matrix (Boston Scientific Neurovascular, Fremont, CA), covered with a bioabsorbable polymeric material (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53492">polyglycolide</z:chebi>/lactide <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53310">copolymer</z:chebi> [PGLA]), was developed to accelerate intraaneurysmal clot organization and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Matrix detachable coils in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and aneurysmal recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a regional neurosurgical center in Hong Kong, data of patients undergoing endovascular embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a 20-month period, 42 patients with 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by endovascular embolization using matrix coils alone or mixed with bare <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients presented with ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 8 patients presented with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (60%) had 6-month follow-up DSA, and 10 patients (24%) had 18-month follow-up DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrences were identified, amounting to 16% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and 14% for ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated by repeated embolization, and 2 patients were treated by microsurgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two adverse events due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One 78-year-old lady with poor-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> treated by partial embolization died from rebleed at day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another patient with partial embolization and spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of dorsal wall ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> died at 2 months with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recanalization with rerupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients achieved favorable outcome (GOS score 4 or 5) at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrence rate using bare <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils of the same center was 11% and 7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Matrix coil embolization was safe, but there was no reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recurrence using matrix coils alone or mixed with GDCs, compared with GDCs alone </plain></SENT>
