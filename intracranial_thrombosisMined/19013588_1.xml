<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although aspirin remains an essential part of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention, platelet response to therapeutic doses is not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some patients exhibit aspirin resistance and develop secondary thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We decided to determine the prevalence of aspirin resistance and/or platelet hypersensitivity, as determined by platelet aggregometry, in sixty Caucasian patients who have suffered one or more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">Transient Ischaemic Attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) as compared with sixty control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Aspirin resistance was determined by platelet aggregation (&gt;20%) to one or more of the four <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, namely <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (1.5 mM), <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> (0.05 microg/ml), collagen (0.2 microg/ml) or <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (0.1x10(-5) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients demonstrated "complete aspirin resistance" (non-responder to aspirin) with resistance to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (high concentration) noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients demonstrated "partial aspirin resistance" (semi-responder to aspirin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One contol subject showed "complete aspirin resistance" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is a 1.67% chance of a control subject being resistant to aspirin in a general South African Caucasian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A history of prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> was associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of aspirin resistance with an odds ratio of 5.36 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results essentially concur with those of the studied literature in showing an 8% prevalence (statistically significant) of aspirin resistance (complete and partial) in South African Caucasian patients with previous atherothrombotic cerebrovascular events i.e. <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The current study shows an increased prevalence of aspirin resistance in people who have had prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and raises the question whether people who have had these events are somehow predisposed to vascular events or indeed recurrent vascular events. "Aspirin resistant" patients or "poor responders" to aspirin must be considered at heightened risk of atherothrombotic events and laboratory monitoring of antiplatelet therapy may become clinically useful </plain></SENT>
