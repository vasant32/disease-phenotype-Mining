<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We prospectively evaluated the safety and effectiveness of aggressive mechanical disruption of clot in conjunction with intra-arterial administration of a low-dose third-generation thrombolytic agent (reteplase) to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients who were considered poor candidates for intravenous alteplase therapy or who failed to improve after intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mechanical clot disruption was used if low-dose pharmacological thrombolysis was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This strategy was adopted to increase the recanalization rate without increasing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were considered poor candidates for intravenous therapy because of severity of neurological deficits, interval from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to presentation of at least 3 hours, or recent major surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We administered a maximum total dose of 4 U of reteplase intra-arterially in 1-U increments via superselective catheterization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the initial doses were administered, we performed mechanical angioplasty (for proximal occlusion) or snare manipulation (for distal occlusion) at the occlusion site if recanalization had not occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining doses of thrombolytics were subsequently administered if required for further recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic responses were graded using modified Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluations were performed before and 24 hours, 7 to 10 days, and 1 to 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen consecutive patients were treated (mean age, 64.3 +/- 16.2 yr; 10 were men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores ranged from 11 to 42 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment ranged from 1 to 9 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Occlusion sites were in the following arteries: cervical internal carotid (n = 7), intracranial internal carotid (n = 1), middle cerebral (n = 9), and basilar (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 patients, thrombolysis alone was used in 5 patients, angioplasty was performed in 11 patients, and snare maneuvers were used in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complete restoration of blood flow (modified TIMI Grade 4) was observed in 12 patients, near-complete restoration of flow (modified TIMI Grade 3) in 4 patients, minimal response (modified TIMI Grade 1) in 1 patient, and no response in 2 patients (modified TIMI Grade 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Neurological improvement at 24 hours (decline of at least 4 points in National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score) was observed in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five other patients experienced further improvement in National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at 7 to 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>No vessel rupture, dissection, or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>At the time of follow-up evaluation, 7 of 19 patients were functionally independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high rate of recanalization and clinical improvement can be observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> using low-dose thrombolytic agents with adjunctive mechanical disruption of clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this strategy may reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> observed with thrombolytics </plain></SENT>
