<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This thermolabile form of MTHFR has 50% reduced activity, has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002160'>hyperhomocystinemia</z:hpo>, and is a described risk factor for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in adults.(1-3) In addition, it has been associated with birth defects in the infants of affected mothers and with recurrent fetal losses.(4-6) We report the occurrence of sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in a newborn infant who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
