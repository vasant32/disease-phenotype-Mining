<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Systemic and local intra-arterial thrombolysis in patients with large vessel ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is hampered by poor re-canalisation rates and risk of haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Merci Retrieval System is an endovascular device for removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our initial experience using this device in conjunction with existing thrombolytic therapy already in place in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presenting with large vessel ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated using the Merci Retrieval System from July 2007 to March 2009 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selection criteria for patients were similar to the multi- Merci trial of 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared re-canalisation rate, National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Score (NIHSS) and modified Rankin score (mRS) outcomes to the published trial results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients were reviewed; none suffered immediate post-procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen underwent successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> retrieval but in 2 cases the device failed due to technical considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> included: ICA/ICA-'T' junctions 27%, middle cerebral artery 13% and vertebrobasilar artery 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients treated by MERCI with or without adjuvant thrombolytic therapy, complete re-canalisation was achieved in 60%, partial re-canalisation in 20%, partial re-canalisation with persistent distal vessel occlusion in 6% and failure of re-canalisation in 14% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic haemorrhage occurred in 33% and there was 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (6%) from symptomatic haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment median NIHSS was 17.88 and 9.5 immediately post-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median mRS at 30 days was 2.6 for patients who achieved complete re-canalisation and 4.5 in failure or partial re-canalisation with or without persistent distal vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Re-canalisation rates using the Merci Retrieval System was comparable to the multi-Merci trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhagic complications and safety were also found to be satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Importantly, treatment success with eventual good clinical outcome hinges strongly on the ability of the device to achieve complete re-canalisation </plain></SENT>
