<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is currently unclear whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, such as splanchnic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, can be the first manifestation of an underlying myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in patients with a first episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were tested for the JAK2 V617F mutation and were followed until the development of a myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> or censored at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of 152 patients (6.6%) carried the JAK2 V617F mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of them had known acquired risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients met the diagnostic criteria for myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, and three additional patients developed the disease during the follow-up (median duration 7.8 years, range 6 months to 21.3 years), giving an annual incidence of 0.26% patient-years (95% confidence interval 0.05-0.64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The last patient has no evidence of disease after 3 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without the JAK2 V617F mutation at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were retested at the end of the follow-up and remained negative, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts (log-rank test Ï‡(2) : 159 [P&lt;0.0001]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> can be the first symptom of a myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> can carry the JAK2 V617F mutation, irrespective of blood count </plain></SENT>
