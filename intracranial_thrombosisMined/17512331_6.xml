<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: MCAO has been widely used to produce ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions induced by MCAO tend to be variable in size because of the variance in the collateral blood supply found in the mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We modified the rat photothrombosis model for use in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by photothrombosis of cortical microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was produced by intraperitoneal injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi>, a photosensitive dye, and by focal illumination through the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor impairment was assessed by the accelerating rotarod and staircase tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain was perfusion fixed for histologic determination of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume 4 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lesion was located in the frontal and parietal cortex and the underlying white matter was partly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relatively constant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was achieved 1 month after photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of the photothrombotic lesion significantly impaired the motor performance as measured by the rotarod and staircase tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that photothrombotic infarction in mice is highly reproducible in size and location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This procedure can provide a simple model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> for a unilateral motor cortex lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, it can provide a suitable model for the study of potential neuroprotective and therapeutic agents in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
