<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in neonates are not well understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked at gender, birthweight, and gestational age in neonates with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to see if there were trends suggesting that these were risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified neonates with a gestational age at birth &gt; or = 36 weeks and a diagnosis of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging during the neonatal period from a consecutive cohort study of children with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on gender, birthweight, and gestational age were obtained by health record review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six children with neonatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-one (62.1%; 95% CI 49.3-73.8%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two children with neonatal cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five (78.1%; 95% CI 60.0-90.7%) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One male child was identified with both arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher than average birthweights among neonates with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and a trend toward older gestational age in female neonates with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that neonatal arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are more commonly diagnosed in boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The slightly larger size of male neonates may be contributory in arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether boys are at higher risk of developing arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or are simply more likely to present with symptoms resulting in diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These issues need further study </plain></SENT>
