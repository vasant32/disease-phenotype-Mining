<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cases of 2 children with true aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> (SAHs) and initial false-negative angiograms are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the initial angiogram was of adequate technical quality and included the projections on which <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were later documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant vasospasm at the time of initial angiography; therefore, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was the most likely explanation for the initial false-negative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is particularly interesting to note that 1 of the 2 patients had a pattern of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> compatible with the most limited definition of a perimesencephalic SAH, that is, a small prepontine cistern <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If a second angiogram had been deemed unnecessary based on that criterion alone, a ruptured basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> would have escaped detection and treatment </plain></SENT>
