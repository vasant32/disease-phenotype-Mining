<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CVT can present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages, but is seen more in young and middle-aged women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CVT does not necessarily occur only when there is an obvious underlying etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In almost 30% of cases, the etiology cannot be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVT can present with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, focal deficits, impaired sensorium, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> is known to be the most frequently associated initial complaint, and is present in more than 80% of patients, but it is not always remembered that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> can be the sole presenting complaint of CVT and even when early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> can occur in isolation in up to 5% of CVT cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is no identifiable, uniform, recognizable pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in CVT, but this article discusses the "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Profile" that is seen more commonly in this setting with an illustration of one such case where the innocuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> turned sinister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging with venography is the investigation of choice to diagnose CVT; computed tomography alone will miss a significant number of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One must keep in mind the possibility of CVT in every patient who presents with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of any type, any severity, and in any location, particularly when there is worsening in spite of <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Earlier the diagnosis, earlier the treatment, better is the outcome </plain></SENT>
