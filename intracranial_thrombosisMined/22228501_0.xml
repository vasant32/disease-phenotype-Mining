<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">Hesperidin</z:chebi>, G-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28819">naringin</z:chebi> were mixed with diet and fed to the animals for 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No effect was evident on body weight, but the supplements significantly suppressed the age related increase in blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic tendency, as assessed using a He-Ne laser technique in the cerebral blood vessels, was significantly decreased in the treated animals compared with the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) demonstrated that the supplements had strong <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these supplements significantly increased the production of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) metabolites in urine measured with Griess reagent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vasodilation induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>-mediated NO production in the endothelium was assessed using thoracic aortic ring preparations and indicated that endothelial function was significantly improved by the administration of these supplements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the strong <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi>, G-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28775">hesperidin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28819">naringin</z:chebi> could modulate the inactivation of NO and protect endothelial function from reactive oxygen species (ROS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this manner, the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoids</z:chebi> could contribute beneficial effects on the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> by increasing the bioavailability of NO </plain></SENT>
