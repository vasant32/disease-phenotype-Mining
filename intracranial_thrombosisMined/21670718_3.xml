<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stent-assisted coiling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> with self-expanding stents has widened the applicability of neuroendovascular therapies to those <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> previously considered "uncoilable" because of poor <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Enterprise Vascular Reconstruction Device and Delivery System (Cordis) has demonstrated promising initial short-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the rates of delayed in-stent stenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report midterm results of the Enterprise stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 10-center registry was created to provide a large volume of data on the safety and efficacy of the Enterprise stent system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pooled data were compiled for consecutive patients undergoing Enterprise stent-assisted coiling at each institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Available follow-up data were evaluated for the incidence of in-stent stenosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 213 patients (176 females) with 219 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with the Enterprise stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One hundred ten patients had undergone delayed angiography (≥ 30 days from stent placement, mean follow-up 174.6 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of patients demonstrated total occlusion with 88% having ≥ 90% <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six percent of patients had delayed (&gt;30 days) angiographic findings, of which 3% demonstrated significant (≥ 50%) in-stent stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven delayed thrombotic events occurred (3%), along with 2 additional immediate periprocedural events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 delayed events were concomitant to cessation of double-antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Midterm occlusion rates are excellent, and stenosis and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> rates are comparable to other available neurovascular stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interruption of antiplatelet therapy appears to be a factor in those developing delayed stenosis or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
