<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Remodeling balloons are used to assist in endovascular coiling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated our experience with balloon-assisted coiling (BAC) in an attempt to determine whether this technique increased the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation or symptomatic thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 3 years, we treated 221 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed to assess whether BAC increased the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation or symptomatic thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size, location, neck width, antiplatelet therapy, and rupture status were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We detected no statistically significant difference in rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation (14% versus 9% with and without BAC, respectively, P=0.35) or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> (7% versus 5% with and without BAC, respectively, P=0.76), though our power to detect small differences was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation with age, sex, rupture status, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size, or location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation (6% versus 16%, P=0.02) and symptomatic thromboembolic complications (3% versus 10%, P=0.04) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were classified as narrow- or wide-necked, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> was associated with a decrease in the rate of complications (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this series, we detected no significant increase in the rates of either intraprocedural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in patients treated with BAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger studies are required to confirm our observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were independently associated with increased rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and symptomatic thromboembolic complications, whereas the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> was protective (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
