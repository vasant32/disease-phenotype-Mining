<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is known that the presence of activated platelets markedly amplifies thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet aggregation, for which thrombin is the most potent stimulator, is effected by the activation of the thrombin receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activated platelets likely provide the principal surfaces on which intrinsic coagulation factors and prothrombinase assemble in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the blood coagulation cascade is simultaneously enhanced during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, resulting in thrombin production and fibrin formation [3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> is thought to be initiated by rupture of atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelets adhere to the constituents of the plaque, and platelet aggregation and the formation of thrombin occur rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of activated platelets involving thrombin generation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> remains to be further clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was undertaken to determine whether argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is effective in inhibiting collagen-induced platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is well known that argatroban inhibits not only thrombin cleavage of fibrinogen with a Ki of 19 nM, but also thrombin-mediated platelet activation with a Ki of 40 nM [4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether the sensitivity of platelets to collagen is increased in the presence of a trace amount of thrombin associated on platelets, at a concentration that does not induce platelet aggregation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The study also measured the inhibitory effect, if any, of the addition of argatroban during platelet hyperactivation induced by collagen </plain></SENT>
