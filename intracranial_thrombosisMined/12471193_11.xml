<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If drug therapy fails, mechanical retrieval seems warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients whose condition was resistant to intravenous and intraarterial thrombolytic drug treatment underwent at least partial clot removal with use of a snare, and almost immediate clinical improvement was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fifth patient's clot was removed before lytic drugs were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients, who presented with a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, were evaluated by arterial angiography; then, after a failed trial of intraarterial fibrinolytic drugs, they were treated by passing a 2- or 4-mm snare through a microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The snare wire was guided around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, gently brought back toward the microcatheter-but not into it-and the entire microcatheter and snare assembly was then removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In four of the five cases, follow-up angiography performed immediately after the retrieval showed wider distal branches than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up computed tomography results were abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, showing hyperdense material in the territory that was previously ischemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This hyperdensity subsided within 48 hours in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient who developed small parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>; however, he remained asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The snare device offers an additional or alternative therapy until completely effective thrombolytic agents become available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although use of a snare is not ideal, device improvements should make the retrieval less technically challenging and more effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There is a need for improved mechanical extraction devices, especially in light of the patient improvement that occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This experience also suggests that immediate removal of a mature clot could reduce the total time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> more quickly than administration of thrombolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
