<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adopting randomized, single-blinded, controlled method, 93 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were randomly assigned to 3 groups, 31 in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated based on neurological routine therapy, those in the treated group and the control group I were treated respectively with SADM and scalp-acupuncture twirling method (SATM) additionally, but for those in the control group II, no additional treatment was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment course for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> was 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before treatment, there were insignificant difference among 3 groups in the score of neural motor function deficits (NFDS) of limbs and activity of daily life (ADL) score (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After being treated for 4 weeks, the NFDS was significantly lower and in the control group II (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) and the change of the scores in the treated group was more than that in the control group I (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SADM was superior to scalp-acupuncture twisting prove the ADL score and motor function of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> patients following <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in the convalescent stage </plain></SENT>
