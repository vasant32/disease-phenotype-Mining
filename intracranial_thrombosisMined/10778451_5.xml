<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> on different functional maps of cerebral perfusion CT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and to compare the results with early ischemic changes on conventional CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The baseline CT scans of 45 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were retrospectively evaluated with respect to early CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each patient the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as shown on the maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and "time to peak" (TP) was compared and the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was assigned to one of three levels based on the findings of the CBF image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients conventional CT was performed within 2 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>29 of 45 patients showed early signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on conventional CT, whereas perfusion CT revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was found in approximately the same rate of incidence in patients with early CT changes (55.2%) and in those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings (43.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the perfusion impairment was judged as mild or moderate the extent of the hypoperfused area was significantly larger on the CBF and TP images than on the CBV map </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was significantly different in patients with severe hypoperfusion where a complete correspondence of the affected area between the three functional maps was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The use of conventional CT for the assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the hyperacute phase is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perfusion CT yields excellent information regarding the severity and extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of various perfusion maps helps to differentiate the core of infarction from the ischemic penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
