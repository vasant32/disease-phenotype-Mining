<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FK419 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> similarly inhibited platelet aggregation in vitro (IC50 values: 0.43+/-0.076 and 0.41+/-0.053 micromol/L) and dispersed aggregated platelets (EC50 values: 2.3+/-0.88 and 2.0+/-0.81 micromol/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FK419 inhibited retention of platelets and neutrophils in a collagen-coated bead column with greater potency than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> (IC50 values of 0.90+/-0.133 and 2.4+/-0.21 micromol/L for platelet retention and 0.32+/-0.078 and 0.57+/-0.180 micromol/L for neutrophil retention) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When FK419 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> were administered after photochemically induced middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in guinea-pigs, they dose-dependently improved <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FK419 reduced neurological deficits and ischemic brain damage in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduced regional cerebral blood flow in the striatum gradually returned to the preoccluded level with FK419 treatment; however, no restoration was observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9605">tirofiban</z:chebi> even though the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that FK419 ameliorates ischemic brain damage by not only lysing the obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but also preventing or restoring microcirculation deficits after occlusion/reperfusion, suggesting that FK419 would be an attractive intervention for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
