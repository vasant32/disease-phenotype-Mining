<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy may be used during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> due to large vessel intracranial occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First-generation MERCI devices achieved recanalization rates of 48% and, when coupled with intraarterial thrombolytic drugs, recanalization rates of 60% have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Enhancements in embolectomy device design may improve recanalization rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multi MERCI was an international, multicenter, prospective, single-arm trial of thrombectomy in patients with large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with persistent large vessel occlusion after IV tissue plasminogen activator treatment were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Once the newer generation (L5 Retriever) device became available, investigators were instructed to use the L5 Retriever to open vessels and could subsequently use older generation devices and/or intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was recanalization of the target vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four patients received thrombectomy and 131 were initially treated with the L5 Retriever </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age+/-SD was 68+/-16 years, and baseline median (interquartile range) National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 19 (15 to 23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the L5 Retriever resulted in successful recanalization in 75 of 131 (57.3%) treatable vessels and in 91 of 131 (69.5%) after adjunctive therapy (intraarterial tissue plasminogen activator, mechanical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2) occurred in 36% and mortality was 34%; both outcomes were significantly related to vascular recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 16 patients (9.8%); 4 (2.4%) of these were parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant procedural complications occurred in 9 (5.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of recanalization were associated with a newer generation thrombectomy device compared with first-generation devices, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mortality trended lower and the proportion of good clinical outcomes trended higher, consistent with better recanalization </plain></SENT>
