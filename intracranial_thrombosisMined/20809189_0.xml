<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recognition and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of CVT is challenging and requires a high index of clinical suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The finding of the "cord sign" in a non-contrast cranial CT is useful for the rapid recognition of CVT in the emergency setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe a patient with CVT in whom the "cord sign" and elevated factor VIII (FVIII) plasma levels were both present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 45-year-old Caucasian man was brought to the emergency room with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and a focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His neurological examination was non-focal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During his evaluation in the ER, a non-contrast cranial CT showed increased density of cortical veins ("cord sign"), vein of Galen, and superior sagittal, transverse and straight sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A brain MRI demonstrated a flow signal void in the superior sagittal sinus, prominent cortical veins, asymmetric flow signal in the right transverse sinus, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory work-up was unremarkable and only revealed elevation of FVIII plasma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of CVT with the "cord sign" and concomitant elevated FVIII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early recognition of the "cord sign" is warranted for the emergency diagnosis and treatment of CVT </plain></SENT>
