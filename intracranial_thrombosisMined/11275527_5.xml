<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate more controllable and reproducible study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related pathophysiological mechanisms, a photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model was initially developed in adult rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ring interior zone comprises an anatomically well confined cortical region-at-risk which is gradually encroached by progressive hypoperfusion, thus mimicking the situation (albeit in inverse fashion) of an ischemic penumbra or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-in-evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Modification of this model using a thinner ring irradiation beam resulted in late spontaneous reperfusion in the cortical region-at-risk and a remarkable morphological tissue recovery in this ostensibly critically injured region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, doubling the thin irradiating beam intensity facilitates a complementary situation in which lack of reperfusion in the region-at-risk after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> induction leads to tissue pannecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dual photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, effectuated either with or without reperfusion and thereby tissue recovery or pannecrosis, may be well suited for the study of events related to postischemic survival or cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the penumbra region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To popularize the photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, we present a detailed protocol of how this model is induced in either version as well as protocols for transcardial carbon black perfusion and laser-Doppler flowmetry experiments </plain></SENT>
