<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> include those that are distal to the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery and proximal to the posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review our experience with the endovascular treatment of this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which are difficult to treat surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between June 1994 and April 1999, 66 patients (56 female, 10 male) with a mean age of 50.1 years (range 13-75, median 51) underwent endovascular treatment for 71 paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean size of the dome was 8.9 mm (range 3-25 mm, median 7) and the of neck was 3.8 mm (range 1.4-8 mm, median 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 4 with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> produced mass effect with visual symptoms, 4 presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and 44 were incidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had had previous unsuccessful surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were performed under general anesthesia and with systemic heparinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety endovascular procedures were performed on 71 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>: GDC coiling in 78 (including 45 with the remodeling technique), permanent balloon occlusion in 9, and 3 had both GDC coiling and permanent balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> it was not possible to place coils in the lumen of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with the available technology and balloon occlusion was not indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of these were treated surgically and 5 remain untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had immediate post procedure angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 61 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that were treated, 46 (75%) have angiographic follow-up of 6 months or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Morphological outcome following endovascular therapy for 61 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at last available follow-up showed &gt; 95% occlusion in 52/61 (85.2%) and &lt;95% in 9/61 (14.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eight patients required surgery, 2 for partial coiling, 2 for refilling of a neck remnant, 2 for persistent mass effect and 2 for coil protrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the 90 procedures performed, 2 (2.2%) patients had major permanent deficits (1 monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>), 1 (1.1%) had a minor visual field cut, and 2 (2.2%) patients died from major embolic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Properly selected paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be successfully treated by endovascular technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The morbidity and mortality rate of the endovascular approach in our experience is equal to or better than the published surgical series of similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We recommend that the endovascular approach be given primary consideration in the treatment of paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
