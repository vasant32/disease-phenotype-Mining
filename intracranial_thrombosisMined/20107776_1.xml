<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cortical vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e>, and its diagnosis is challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the value of different imaging modalities for the detection of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients with CVT, either isolated (n = 3) or in combination with sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 10), and 20 control patients without any venous pathologies were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analysis was performed independently by three blinded readers who evaluated the following imaging modalities and sequences separately: non-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT); multi-detector row CT angiography (MDCTA); diffusion-weighted (DWI), T1-weighted (T1w), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-weighted (PDw), T2*-weighted (T2*w), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-weighted (FLAIRw) magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) sequences; as well as venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (vMRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) and negative predictive values, and interobserver agreement of the different modalities were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2*w showed the highest sensitivity for the detection of CVT (97.4%), followed by T1w (70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FLAIRw and vMRA had a sensitivity of 50% and 41.7%, respectively, whereas the sensitivity of NCCT, MDCTA, DWI, and PDw was below 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The specificity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> modalities was 100%, with good to perfect interobserver agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: T2*w was the superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging sequence for diagnosing CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides T2*w, only T1w reached a sensitivity of over 50% for CVT, followed by FLAIRw, and vMRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, our results suggest that NCCT but also MDCTA might not be suitable for diagnosing CVT </plain></SENT>
