<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Rats were randomly divided into sham-operated, model, thrombolysis, rhubarb aglycone and combination (rhubarb aglycone combined with thrombolysis) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, rats in model, thrombolysis, rhubarb aglycone and combination groups were randomly divided into 3, 6, and 9 h groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-occluded <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was duplicated by using the combination of rats' auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> with inserting the nylon thread </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were administrated with thrombolysis therapy through artery at 3, 6, and 9 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 24 h of administration through artery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> ratio (ICHR) and mortality of rats were observed, and then the brain of rats was taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the study, expression of IgG, CoLIV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> in rats brain were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Thrombolysis at 9 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> made rats mortality and BHR increase, administration of combined therapy could make them decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of IgG level in rats brain of 9 h and 6 h model groups increased, while CoLIV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> expression decreased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each administration 9 h group, IgG level was lower, and CoLIV and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> were higher, such changes appeared significantly in rhubarb aglycone and association groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Brain microvascular basement membrane impairment could be caused by the therapy of delayed thrombolysis, which made the mortality and BHR increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rhubarb aglycone combined with the therapy of thrombolysis could perform the protective effects on brain microvascular basement membrane and then decrease the ICHR and mortality caused by thrombolysis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
