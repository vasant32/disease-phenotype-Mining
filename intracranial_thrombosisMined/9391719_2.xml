<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, the thrombomodulin and Lp(a) levels were significantly higher and the total cholesterol level was significantly lower than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, while the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> had significantly lower total cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of Lp(a) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, but not that of thrombomodulin, was significantly higher in thromboses located in the cortex area and in patients with recurrent attacks than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in thrombomodulin, Lp(a) or total cholesterol levels between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings support the hypothesis that Lp(a) plays a part as a risk factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, especially in patients with a cortex area <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and in patients with a recurrent attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high levels of thrombomodulin in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>-phase <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> group suggests the presence of continuous endothelial cell damage </plain></SENT>
