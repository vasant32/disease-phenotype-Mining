<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> on thrombogenesis and the cerebral microcirculation of the female rat were studied during the oestrous cycle and after ovariectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23965">oestradiol</z:chebi> (E2) and plasma concentrations of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) metabolites were significantly greater at pro-oestrus than at dioestrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood vessel diameter, mean red cell velocity, wall shear rate and blood flow at pro-oestrus were significantly higher than at dioestrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic tendency, assessed using a He-Ne laser-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model, was significantly decreased at pro-oestrus compared with dioestrus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The long-term deprivation of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> by ovariectomy significantly depressed serum levels of E2 and plasma concentrations of NO metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic tendency was significantly increased 4 weeks after ovariectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameter, mean red cell velocity, wall shear rate and blood flow in pial arterioles were significantly reduced after ovariectomy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results strongly indicate that <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> mediates beneficial effects on the cerebral microcirculation and moderates cerebral thrombotic mechanisms in the female rat </plain></SENT>
