<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational, multicenter epidemiologic study (294 hospitals) with a total of 3,512 patients enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients had had an atherothrombotic event in the coronary or cerebral vascular territory in the previous month or were diagnosed of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> within the last 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 237 investigators (155 cardiologists, 113 neurologists, and 79 vascular surgeons) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 54.9% of patients in the study had a previous atherothrombotic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these, 63.1% were on antithrombotic therapy; after the second episode, 2.6% of patients were on no preventive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A great disparity and an excessive number of diagnostic tests was found to confirm the diagnosis of the current atherothrombotic event, which is in contrast with a small percentage of patients who had exams performed to confirm or rule out the atherothrombotic involvement in other vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An appropriate protocol should be established for the diagnosis and therapy of patients with the likelihood of having clinical manifestations due to an ahterothrombotic event </plain></SENT>
