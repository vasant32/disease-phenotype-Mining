<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While it is believed aPL react with endothelial cells to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, it is not known to what degree aPL react with neural tissue nor which particular aPL specificities may be more relevant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated direct aPL reactivity with the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) using 3 monoclonal IgM aPL that differentiate between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and phosphatidylserine dependent antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain and spinal cord from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cat Felis domesticus and brain from CD-1 mice were reacted with aPL using indirect immunoperoxidase techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal aPL were reacted with whole brain myelin by dot immunoblots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Monoclonal D11A4, reactive with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> and not phosphatidylserine (CL+/PS-), did not react with any portion of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both monoclonal 3SB9b (CL-/PS+) and BA3B5C4 (CL+/PS+) reacted in feline and murine <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both labeled myelinated fibers in grey and white matter of brain and spinal cord in an identical pattern with positive control antibody against myelin basic protein and reacted with whole human brain myelin by dot immunoblot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3SB9b (CL-+PS+) additionally reacted with ependyma and epithelium of the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: aPL, especially those reactive with phosphatidylserine dependent antigens, react directly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> associated with myelin, brain ependyma, or choroid epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Direct reactivity of aPL with <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> tissue may be relevant to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
