<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraine with aura</z:hpo> (MA) have a high prevalence of white matter lesions (WMLs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RILES), mainly due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo>, is frequently associated with MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between RILES and WML in MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 87 consecutive subjects affected by MA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were screened for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> characteristics and cerebrovascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler was used to diagnose RILES and MRI with T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to evaluate presence, number and volume of WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RILES was present in 45% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We did not detect any DWI hyperintense lesion; WMLs were present in 61% of patients on T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presence of WMLs did not correlate with any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> clinical feature, whereas the presence, number and volume of WMLs increased with subjects' age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the total volume and number of WMLs in the group with and without RILES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, RILES does not increase the likelihood of finding WMLs in migraineurs </plain></SENT>
