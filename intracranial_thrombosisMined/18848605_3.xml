<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The variability in the behavioral outcome of human and nonhuman animals after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> raises the question whether the way that a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurs is a contributing factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in rats has been reported to produce especially variable results, with some animals showing either slight to no impairment to other animals displaying severe impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated this variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats received three different-sized photothrombotic treatments and were contrasted to rats receiving a "standard" motor cortex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> produced by pial stripping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rats were assessed acutely and chronically on a skilled reaching for food task using end-point measures and movement assessment in a constraint-induced rehabilitation paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that as the size of the photothrombotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> approached the size of the pial strip <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> so did <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> behavioral deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless there were differences in the time course of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats with photothrombotic lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sizes were less impaired in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period of recovery both on measures of learned nonuse and constrained-induced recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings are discussed in relation to the idea that whereas the course of recovery might be altered as a function of the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> deficits are more closely related to the ensuing damage </plain></SENT>
