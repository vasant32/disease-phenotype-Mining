<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This descriptive multicenter study describes the results for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> patients in South Asia and the Middle East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The retrospective and prospective data of patients with radiologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were collected from 4 centers located in Pakistan and United Arab Emirates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demographic, clinical, radiological, and outcome data were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or dependency (modified Rankin score &gt;2) at the time of hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This study included 109 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>; the presenting features most commonly being observed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (81%), focal motor deficits (45%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (39%), and mental status changes (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Important predisposing factors included systemic and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (18%), postpartum state (17%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002160'>hyperhomocystinemia</z:hpo> (9%), genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (5%), and oral contraceptive pill use (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six (67%) patients received therapeutic anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died and 43 had poor outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Focal motor deficits (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.2-7.5; P=0.018) and hemorrhagic infarctions (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.04-7.85; P=0.041) were independent predictors of unfavorable outcome at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction was the most significant factor of long-term unfavorable outcome (OR, 5.87; 95% CI, 1.49-23.02; P=0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> and postpartum state were the most common predisposing factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most patients (67%) were treated with anticoagulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Almost 50% of patients were dead or disabled at discharge </plain></SENT>
