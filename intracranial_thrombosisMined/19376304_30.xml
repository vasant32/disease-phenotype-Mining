<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dabigatran etexilate is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrug</z:chebi> that is rapidly converted to the active direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is administered in a fixed dose without laboratory monitoring and is being compared with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (international normalized ratio 2-3) in the RE-LY trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two doses of dabigatran (110 and 150 mg BID) are being evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RE-LY is a phase 3, prospective, randomized, open-label multinational (44 countries) trial of patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recruitment concluded with a total of 18,113 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who were VKA-naive and experienced are included in balanced proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (including hemorrhagic) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Safety outcomes are <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, liver function abnormalities, and other adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Adjudication of end points is blinded to drug assignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trial is expected to accrue a minimum of 450 events with a minimum 1-year of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RE-LY is the largest AF <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention trial yet undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is unique because it includes equal numbers of VKA-experienced and naive patients and evaluates 2 different dosages of dabigatran, which may allow tailoring of dosing to individual patient needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The worldwide site distribution and broad range of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk further increase the general applicability of the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Results are expected in 2009 </plain></SENT>
