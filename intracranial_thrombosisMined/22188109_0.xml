<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although several reports on Cd toxicity were presented, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> effect of Cd on systemic and thrombotic events was not reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cd (2.284 mg/kg) or saline (control) was injected intraperitoneally (ip), and the systemic parameters were assessed in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to control group, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intraperitoneal injection of Cd, in mice showed significant quickening of platelet aggregation (P&lt;0.001) leading to pial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Likewise, Cd exposure caused a significant increase in white blood cell numbers (P&lt;0.05) indicating the occurrence of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P&lt;0.05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) levels were both significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activity was significantly decreased in Cd treated group compared to control group (P&lt;0.001), suggesting the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the Cd exposure in mice causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and alter liver and kidney functions </plain></SENT>
