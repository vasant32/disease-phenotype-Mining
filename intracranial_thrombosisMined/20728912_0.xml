<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective monocentric study including 26 patients referred to the Neurology Department of the Military Hospital of Tunis between January 2005 and January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CVT was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical and biological risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 18 months (range six to 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was assessed clinically with the modified Rankin scale and with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age was 38.26 years, predominantly females (sex-ratio 4.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in 88.46% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most common inaugural sign (84.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lateral and superior longitudinal sinuses were the most commonly involved with equal frequency (61.53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal lesions were frequently noted (77%), especially hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (46.15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The causes of CVT were variable and usually combined (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and obstetric-gynecological causes were predominant with a prevalence of 61.5 and 42.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Septic causes (38.46%) are also frequent, mainly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0555971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">oral infections</z:e> (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Outcome was favorable in 77% of patients given <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy, followed by oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and antibiotics as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our Tunisian population presented distinct clinical features compared with previous studies, including a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and gyneco-obstetrical disorders as well as infectious causes </plain></SENT>
