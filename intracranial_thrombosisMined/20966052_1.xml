<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concept combines the advantages of stent deployment with immediate flow-restoration and of mechanical thrombectomy with definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to gain more knowledge about the principle of combined flow restoration and thrombectomy in an established animal model using radiopaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> evaluating efficiency, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction and possible complications of the first dedicated flow-restoration and mechanical thrombectomy device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Solitaire FR (4 Ã— 20 mm) was evaluated in 15 vessel occlusions in an established animal model in swine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow-restoration effect at T0, T5, and T10; recanalization rate after retrieval; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>; and complications were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiopaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (10-mm length) were used for visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction during application and retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediate flow restoration was achieved in 80% of occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean percentage of recanalization compared with the initial vessel diameter at T0 was 30.8%; at T5, 30.7%; and at T10, 25.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Re-occlusion occurred in 20.0% between T0 and T5 and in 13.3% between T5 and T10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization (TICI 3) after retrieval was achieved in 86.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases (13.3%), partial recanalization was achieved, with the remaining <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in a side branch (TICI 2b) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No thromboembolic event was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction illustrated the compression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> against the vessel wall during deployment leading to partial flow restoration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During retrieval, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was retained by the stent struts even during the passage of vessel curvatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Solitaire FR is a safe and effective combined flow-restoration and thrombectomy device in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Partial flow restoration is achieved by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> compression immediately after deployment, but flow restoration decreases afterward until final retrieval results in maximal recanalization </plain></SENT>
