<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a study to evaluate the role of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), factor V Leiden G1691A (FVL), prothrombin gene mutation G20210A (FII-G20210A) and methylenotetrahydrofolate reductase variant C677T (MTHFR-C677T), as risk factors for CVT in Tunisian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A single center case-control study (26 patients with CVT and 197 controls) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was tested for the three SNP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The principle finding was the association between FVL and CVT (p&lt;0.001, Odds ratio=6.1, 95% confidence interval=2.3-16.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, neither the FII-G20210 (p=0.536) nor the homozygous MTHFR-C677T genotype (p=0.325) variant contributed to the risk of CVT in these Tunisian patients </plain></SENT>
