<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because both thalami drain into the vein of Galen and straight sinus, bilateral thalamic involvement is frequently encountered in internal CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, unilateral thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> may also occur, even if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> internal cerebral veins are occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests collateral venous drainage of the thalami, which is commonly insufficient in internal CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the thalamus, including 3 patients reported here, had mostly left-sided involvement, indicating that right-sided unilateral thalamic involvement in CVT may be clinically silent </plain></SENT>
