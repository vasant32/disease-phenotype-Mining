<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The coagulability of plasmas from 63 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e>) was analyzed by an automated method for prothrombin time using a fluorogenic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The fluorogenic prothrombin time (FPT) of patients' plasmas collected within 48 hr after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, as expressed as percent of control plasma, was significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> than in an age-matched control group (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The high values of FPT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> patients were observed until the 30th day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, FPT values in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> patients were not significantly different than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor VII activity levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> patients were significantly higher than those of the control group and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> patients, while levels of factor X activity were not significantly different among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although FPT and factor VII activity in these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients did not significantly correlate, factor VII activity did correlate well with factor VII antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of antithrombin III and elevated levels of FDP and alpha 2-antiplasmin-plasmin complexes were observed only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings strongly suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> have been in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, which was caused in part by an increase of factor VII activity/antigen, and in part by other unknown mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> were in a low grade consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
