<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of an antiplatelet agent (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi>) on the process of laser-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in mice using intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BL</z:e>/6J mice (n = 19) were anesthetized using chloral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35505">hydrate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The head of each mouse was fixed with a head holder, and a cranial window was made in the parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelets were labeled in vivo by intravenous administration of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg, n = 6; 10 mg/kg, n = 6) was administered orally for 2 days before the experiment </plain></SENT>
