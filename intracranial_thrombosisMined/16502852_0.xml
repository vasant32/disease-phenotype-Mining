<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 23,979 out of 27,304 registered patients in the Aichi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient registration program with 4 type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (CRT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> (CRE), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH)) were analyzed for complications and prognosis (survival, disability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>), with reference to gender, age-groups, and types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 13,365 (55.7%) male (65.5 +/- 12.2 yr: Mean +/- SD) and 10,614 (44.3%) female (69.7 +/- 13.3 yr) patients were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, CRT comprised the highest percentage, both in males (49.5%) and females (41.1%), followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (males: 30.4%, females: 29.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of SAH in females (17.3%) was found to be about twice as high as that in males (8.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analyses of complications revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> to be the greatest risk factor in both sexes (about 50%), followed by history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (males: 20.1%, females: 16.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male patients had a significantly higher overall survival rate (84.7%) than females (81.0%) (P &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAH was associated with the lowest survival rate in both sexes (about 60%), with statistical significance (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Development of disability or/and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> as sequela of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was higher in females (disability: 54.5%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>: 21.1%) than in males (44.2%, 15.1%, respectively) (P&lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression analyses revealed that the factors most contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were advanced age, a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the development of disability and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, being femal, of advanced age, with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> were important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism appeared to be a protection factor regarding prognosis (survival, disability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is the most frequently reported complication for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> except CRE, and logistic regression analyses revealed that the factor contributing most to prognosis (survival, disability, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>) was a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggested the importance of: i) removing hypertansion as the most significant risk factor, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> in order to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; and ii) preventing re-attack(s) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in order to improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
