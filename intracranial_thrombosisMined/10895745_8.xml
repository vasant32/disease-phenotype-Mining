<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective survey of anaesthesia for Caesarean section (CS) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">placenta praevia</z:e> was performed, covering the period between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and fifty consecutive cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">placenta praevia</z:e> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall a regional technique was used 60% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five women had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">placenta accreta</z:e> which required Caesarean hysterectomy: one had general anaesthesia (GA) throughout and four initially received a single-shot spinal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these latter four cases, two were converted to GA during the hysterectomy and two continued with spinal anaesthesia throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two other women (both GA), suffered postoperative thrombotic episodes (one pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>) but made full recoveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control of blood pressure when using regional anaesthesia (RA), even in the presence of considerable haemorrhage, was not a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistical regression models indicated that RA was associated with a significantly reduced estimated blood loss and reduced need for blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This retrospective survey finds no data to support the much quoted aphorism that RA is contraindicated for CS in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">placenta praevia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
