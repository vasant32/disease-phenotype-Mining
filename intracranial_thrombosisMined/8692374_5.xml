<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rare case of metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and subsequent neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation and rupture is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three months after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnancy and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> delivery, a 16-year-old woman was admitted with the chief complaints of speech disturbance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> of her right upper extremity on June 4, 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both CT and MRI demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the left insula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cerebral angiogram revealed that the left middle cerebral artery (about 2 mm in diameter) was occluded in the distal M2 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the 34th day, a follow up angiogram demonstrated a fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the same point of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> that had been already recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the 37th day, she suddenly had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and consciousness disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resection of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and left STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histological examination revealed that the aneurysmal walls were invaded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the 60th day, she was transfer≈ïed to the department of obstetrics and gynecology for chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the 65th day and the 71st day, the patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the left basal ganglia, which originated from a different point of aneurysmectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She died because of the rapid growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> 7 months after initial admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Because chest CT and roentgenogram detected no lesion in the lungs, neoplastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was unlikely as a cause of occlusion of the cerebral artery of about 2 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It would be more reasonable to believe that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> metastasized to the cerebral arterial walls initially and formed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> which occluded the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As the neoplastic invasion weakened the arterial wall, a fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was formed when the vessel was recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There has been no case reported in the literature of neoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100768'>choriocarcinoma</z:hpo> in which the course from aneurysmal formation to rupture was followed angiographically </plain></SENT>
