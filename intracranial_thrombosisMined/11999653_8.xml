<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to use a new sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to investigate whether circulating HGF is increased in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating HGF was measured in 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on admission to hospital and on days 2, 3, 7 and 14 after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum HGF levels exceeded the mean value +2SD (329pg/ml) measured in controls in 10 of 20 patients (50%) within 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and in 15 of 32 patients (47%) within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma D-dimer was increased in more than half of the patients with elevated HGF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HGF levels in 16 patients who were measured serially were persistently increased throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggests that circulating HGF is a reliable early marker of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and that this new sensitive HGF assay may be useful for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
