<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adopting single-blind, randomized controlled method, 90 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> at convalescent period were assigned to 3 groups: a scalp acupuncture group (group A), a rehabilitation therapy group (group B) and a scalp acupuncture combined with rehabilitation therapy group (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A were treated with scalp acupuncture at the anterior oblique line of vertex-temporal and the posterior oblique line of vertex-temporal on the healthy side; group B were treated with modern rehabilitation medical therapy, making limb function treatment; group C were treated with the scalp acupuncture in the group A combined with the rehabilitation therapy in the group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Improvement of neural function defect and activity of daily life (ADL), and clinical therapeutic effect were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After treatment, the scores of neural function defect of 6.14 +/- 0.36 in the group C was significantly lower than 8.94 +/- 0.56 in the group A and 8.64 +/- 0.49 in the group B (P&lt;0.05); the score of ADL of 88.39 +/- 10.02 and clinical therapeutic effect of 90.0% in the group C were significantly higher than 74.19 +/- 12.12 and 76.7% in the group A and 72.29 +/- 11.52 and 73.3% in the group B (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The scalp acupuncture and rehabilitation therapy have synergistic action in improving motor function for the hemiplegic patient of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> at convalescent period, and it is a better method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> at the convalescent stage </plain></SENT>
