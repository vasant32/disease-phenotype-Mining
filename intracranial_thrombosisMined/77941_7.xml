<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality in 13 years, taking into account blood-pressures at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 surveys, showed that mortality was significantly increased only at pressures above 180 mm Hg systolic or 110 mm Hg diastolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was estimated that without this degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> the total number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> between the ages of 45 and 69 years would have been reduced by about 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike other reports, mortality showed no significant association with lower levels of blood-pressure; this difference may be due to a lower incidence in this community of coronary and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relation between blood-pressure and mortality cannot be assumed to be identical in populations with different profiles of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular pathology</z:e> </plain></SENT>
