<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients were admitted within 2 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and received 1.5 million units of streptokinase over a 30- to 60-minute period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical observations and serial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphokinase-MB were indicative of vessel patency in 115 (88%) of the patients after initiation of thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of this group, 105 underwent catheterization, and recanalization was demonstrated in 97 (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of the patients who underwent reperfusion were subsequently maintained with medical therapy; 50% underwent either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major morbidity was confined to <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>; no cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was 1 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and 2 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 1 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and 1 to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the benefit of intravenous streptokinase thrombolysis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> presenting within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pain, unless specific potential <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> problems exist or in the case of certain very elderly persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the trial demonstrated the feasibility of triaging patients who have undergone lytic therapy to a central facility for catheterization and management </plain></SENT>
