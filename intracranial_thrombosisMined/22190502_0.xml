<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults, protocols for mechanical clot disruption and direct thrombolysis are established; no guidance exists for children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present our experience of 6 children with cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and ominous clinical progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that effective thrombolysis required substantially longer infusion, more rounds of mechanical disruption, and higher doses of thrombolytics than are commonly practiced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite pervasive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, prethrombolysis <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, and other predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and disability, our patients survived and 4 of 6 had no functional deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient had moderate, and one had severe deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report these cases to illustrate that <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> may not be a contraindication to thrombolysis for cerebral venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, that prolonged infusion may be required to restore perfusion, and that good neurologic outcomes can be achieved despite dire clinical presentations and extensive sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
