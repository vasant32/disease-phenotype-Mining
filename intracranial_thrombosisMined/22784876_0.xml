<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients who undergo neurovascular stent placement with postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, there is no protocol for balancing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> if urgent neurosurgical procedures are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We detail perioperative management of dual antiplatelet therapy in a 66-year-old man with a dolichoectatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar artery treated with a Pipeline stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, the patient was placed on aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> to prevent in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One month after the procedure, his neurological status declined secondary to obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His condition necessitated urgent placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, despite the dual antiplatelet therapy for the flow-diverting Pipeline stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> were discontinued seven days prior to the planned shunt placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To minimize time off antiplatelet therapy, aspirin was immediately replaced with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eptifibatide was then started three days prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>/eptifibatide bridge was discontinued at midnight prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aspirin was restarted on the first postoperative day and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> was restarted on the second postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient tolerated shunt placement without excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the remainder of his hospital course, no evidence of stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that management of antiplatelet prophylaxis for neurovascular stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients requiring urgent neurosurgical procedures may be successfully achieved by bridging aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> and eptifibatide in the preoperative period </plain></SENT>
