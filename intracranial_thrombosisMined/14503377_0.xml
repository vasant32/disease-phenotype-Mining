<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The bilateral carotid arterial of guinea pigs were ligated and 40% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> solution was applied to basilar artery topically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood flow of cochlea(CBF) was measured continuously with laser doppler flow-meter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean arterial pressure (MABP) was recorded simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data was analysed by t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: After the administration of 40% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> to basilar artery, The CBF began decrease significantly from 5 to 10 min, and declined more great along with the prolongation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CBF reached to (64.5 +/- 4.2)% of the base level at 50 min after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total average decrease of CBF was (81.3 +/- 12.0)% of the base level throughout the experiment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MABP had no significant change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The topical application of 40% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> solution can offer an ideal model of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
