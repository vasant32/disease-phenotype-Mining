<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> occurs within atherosclerotic plaques, and plaque vulnerability and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> have been associated with increased numbers of microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to microvessel number, it is possible that the phenotypes of intraplaque vessels could influence plaque stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test this, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and maturity of vessels within plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid plaques were collected after endarterectomy from a cohort of 13 asymptomatic patients and 30 symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plaques were sectioned and immunostained for the presence of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and vascular endothelial growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sections were assessed for microvessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, maturity as judged by smooth muscle cell cover, and the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two types of vascular structure were observed within plaques, microvessels and dilated, highly irregular multilobular vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These irregular dysmorphic vessels were found almost exclusively in plaques from symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The dysmorphic vessels lacked smooth muscle cells and were highly immature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plaques also contained vascular endothelial growth factor, and this was observed adjacent to the dysmorphic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This growth factor was found colocalized with macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic carotid plaques contain abnormal, immature microvessels similar to those found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and healing wounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such vessels could contribute to plaque instability by acting as sites of vascular leakage by inflammatory cell recruitment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The immature vessels within plaques may be therapeutic targets for promoting plaque stabilization </plain></SENT>
