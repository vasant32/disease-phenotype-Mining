<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is generally problematical to use in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">edentulous</z:e> patients, because the palatal lift prosthesis requires secure retention of the denture base and is difficult for the patient to retain while eating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article describes the fabrication of a complete denture with a removable palatal lift prosthesis and a clinical evaluation of the denture's stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205707" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sprue</z:e> pin and tube were used as a connecting attachment between the removable palatal lift prosthesis and the denture base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The force required for lifting the soft palate and the denture's stability were measured in the clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prosthesis required an average retentive force of 0.26 N for each 1 mm of soft palate lift </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The force required to dislodge the denture was measured with and without the palatal lift prosthesis in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The force required to dislodge the conventional complete dentures of five healthy individuals was also measured as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The denture was 24.4% less stable when the palatal lift prosthesis was in place and was generally easier to dislodge than were conventional dentures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This denture with a removable palatal lift prosthesis is useful for patients with dysfunction of the soft palate involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0001614'>hypernasal speech</z:hpo> who have difficulty in retaining the prosthesis while eating </plain></SENT>
