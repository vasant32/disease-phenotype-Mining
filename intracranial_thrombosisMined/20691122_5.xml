<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated for the first time gait parameters of rat models for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using the Catwalk method, a novel automated gait analysis test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Static and dynamic gait parameters were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animal models, and these data were compared to readouts of established behavioral tests, such as the cylinder test in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rats and the rotarod tests for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hemiparkinsonian rats were generated by unilateral injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine in the striatum or in the medial forebrain bundle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020179" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HD">Huntington's disease</z:e>, a transgenic rat model expressing a truncated huntingtin fragment with multiple CAG repeats was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model was generated by a photothrombotic induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the right sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that multiple gait parameters were significantly altered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684309" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">disease models</z:e> compared to their respective controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Behavioural deficits could be efficiently measured using the cylinder test in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> animals, and in the case of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> model, the deficits in gait essentially confirmed results obtained by the cylinder test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> model and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model the Catwalk analysis proved more sensitive than the rotarod test and also added new and more detailed information on specific gait parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The automated quantitative gait analysis test may be a useful tool to study both motor impairment and recovery associated with various neurological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">motor disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
