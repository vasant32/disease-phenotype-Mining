<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Devices that can quickly and safely remove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and promote recanalization are useful in the management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Alligator retrieval device, developed for endovascular foreign body retrieval, may also be useful for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (aged 31 to 88 years) who underwent intra-arterial therapy with the Alligator retrieval device at our center are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Alligator retrieval device was able to retrieve the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in 5 of 7 cases with good to excellent recanalization seen and was unsuccessful in 2 of 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization was obtained in one of 7 patients and near complete recanalization obtained in 4 of 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the 7 patients had good outcome at 3 months and 3 of 7 patients died within 30 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Alligator retrieval device was successfully able to remove <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears to have increased success in proximal occlusions in relatively straight segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In properly selected cases, it may be a useful device in intra-arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management </plain></SENT>
