<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The management of patients with presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> has been recently modified by magnetic resonance imaging and evidence that the early use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> decreases mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Long term outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) has rarely been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the results of a follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients admitted between 1987 and 1999 for CVT were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome and follow-up were obtained from direct observation or telephone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 16 women and 4 men aged a mean of 39 years (range: 19 to 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The population was followed-up for a mean of 34 months (range: 12-96) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were initially treated with full-dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 20 patients (65%) exhibited no after effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (35%) remained neurologically impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The outcome of clinical forms with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> appeared better, but the existence of an initial neurological deficit is of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The small cohort in our series did not permit us to identify other poor prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient (5%) exhibited subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Only one patient (5%) suffered for a second CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient died from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100615'>ovarian neoplasm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No systemic venous thromboembolic relapse was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Three patients had non <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032962" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complicated pregnancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recurrent CVT and systemic venous thrombo-embolic episodes are rare although <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment was suspended early in more than half of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This would question the indication of long-term antivitamin K, which is clearly indicated in auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e> but is debatable in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
