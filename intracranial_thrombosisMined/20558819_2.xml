<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate endothelial repair processes in denuded pial vessels to clarify mechanisms for reconstructing endothelium (because endothelial repair of the cerebral artery after its damage is critical for the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the maintenance of vascular tone, and the protection of the brain by the blood-brain barrier) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial cells (ECs) in a 350-microm-long segment of the middle cerebral artery were damaged through a photochemical reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tie2-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice were used for the identification of ECs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six hours after the endothelial damage, ECs were detached from the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface of the damaged artery, which was then covered with a platelet carpet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 24 hours, recovery of the denuded artery started at both edges, with EC elongation and migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The repair rate was faster at the proximal edge than at the distal edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reendothelialization with EC proliferation peaked at 2 to 3 days and ended at 5 days, together with normalization of EC length, with no apparent involvement of foreign progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo study demonstrated a stepwise reendothelialization process by resident ECs of the pial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, vasospasm, and treatment for blood-brain barrier dysfunction should be considered during the reendothelialization period </plain></SENT>
