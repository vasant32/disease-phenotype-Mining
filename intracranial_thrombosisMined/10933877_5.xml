<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effects of postlesional, orally applied ebselen, a neuroprotective <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, on serum levels of IL-6 and cerebral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 expression following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ebselen (50 mg/kg body weight) was given 30 min postlesion to male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were divided into four groups: sham-operated vehicle control (n = 9), sham-operated ebselen control (n = 8), lesioned vehicle control (n = 14), and lesioned ebselen-treated (n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ebselen treatment resulted in a significant lowering of IL-6 plasma levels (26 +/- 5 pg/ml) as compared with that seen in lesioned vehicle controls (48 +/- 9 pg/ml) at 24 h postlesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated rats IL-6 was not detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">Heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1-positive glial cells were quantitated within topographically determined perilesional brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within the 0.5-mm-wide rim region directly associated with the lesion core, no differences in the amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1-positive glial cells were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the more remote ipsilateral perilesional cortex, significantly fewer <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1-positive glial cells were present within the supragranular cortical layers of lesioned ebselen-treated rats compared to lesioned vehicle controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated rats, no glial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 induction occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that postlesional ebselen treatment lowered plasma IL-6 levels subsequent to a photothrombotic lesion concomitant with a lowering of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 response in glial cells </plain></SENT>
