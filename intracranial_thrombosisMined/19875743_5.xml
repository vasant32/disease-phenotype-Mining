<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is approved for eligible patients who can be treated within a 3-hour window, but treatment rates remain disappointingly low, often &lt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To improve rapid access to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> thrombolysis in Toronto, Canada, a citywide prehospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> activation protocol was implemented by the provincial government to transport <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients directly to one of 3 regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers, bypassing local hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This comprised a paramedic screening tool, ambulance destination decision rule, and formal memorandum of understanding of system stakeholders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report describes the initial impact of the activation protocol at our regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> arriving to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center during the first 4 months of this new triage protocol (February 14 to June 14, 2005) versus the same 4-month period in 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The protocol resulted in an immediate doubling in the number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> arriving to our regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center within 2.5 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed a 4-fold increase in patients who were eligible for and treated with tissue plasminogen activator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The tissue plasminogen activator treatment rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients increased from 9.5% to 23.4% (P=0.01), and one in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> arriving within 2.5 hours received thrombolysis during this period (one in 5 of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> overall) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>-to-needle time for tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Many implementation challenges were identified and addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This prehospital triage was immediately successful in improving tissue plasminogen activator access for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, enabling our center to achieve one of the highest tissue plasminogen activator treatment rates in North America and underscoring the need for coordinated systems of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sustainability of such an initiative will be dependent on interdisciplinary teamwork, ongoing paramedic training, adequate hospital staffing, bed availability, and repatriation agreements with community hospitals </plain></SENT>
