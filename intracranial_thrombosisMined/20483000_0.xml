<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still controversial whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> should receive rtPA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 99 patients altogether who belonged to three different groups based on the patient characteristics: (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> rtPA-treated group consisting of 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> treated with rtPA within 4.5 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> non-rtPA-treated group consisting of 44 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> matching in age and baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS); (3) the non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> rtPA-treated group consisting of 33 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> treated with rtPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median time for the administration of rtPA was 199.6 +/- 50.0 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More patients had favorable outcomes (90 day modified Rankin Scale 0-1) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> rtPA-treated group than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> non-rtPA-treated group (36.4 versus 13.6%; odds ratio=2.667; 95% confidence interval: 1.056-6.735; p=0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality at day 90 was lower in the rtPA-treated group than the non-rtPA-treated group (18.2 versus 20.5%; p=0.827), although the incidence of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was higher (18.2 versus 6.8%; p=0.184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> rtPA-treated group had fewer favorable outcomes than non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> rtPA-treated group (36.4 versus 51.6%; p=0.076), but their baseline NIHSS was higher (12.0 +/- 7.1 versus 9.1 +/- 7.3; p=0.161) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As compared with non-rtPA-treated patients, rtPA treated within 4.5 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> significantly improved clinical outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thrombolytic treatment increases <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> rate but does not increase mortality </plain></SENT>
