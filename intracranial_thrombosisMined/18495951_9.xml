<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Large studies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> not receiving thrombolytic therapy have repeatedly demonstrated poorer outcomes for women compared to men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An analysis of five pooled randomized controlled trials testing IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) demonstrated that rtPA benefits women more than men; the usual gender difference, apparent among controls, was totally nullified in the rtPA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This nullification of the usual gender effect among rtPA-treated patients has not been confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed baseline characteristics and functional outcomes in men vs women in the Canadian Alteplase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Effectiveness Study (CASES), a multicenter study that collected outcomes data for patients treated with rtPA in Canada to assess the safety and effectiveness of alteplase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the context of routine care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1,110 patients, including 615 men and 505 women, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> outcome at 90 days was found in 37.1% of men vs 36.0% of women (p = 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was essentially unchanged after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, including age &gt;70, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, baseline National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Severity, and baseline Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT score (35.2% in men vs 38.2% in women, p = 0.332) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-day mortality was similar between the sexes in both the adjusted and unadjusted analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in 90-day outcomes in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-treated men and rtPA-treated women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials, showing greater benefit for thrombolysis in women and nullification of the usual gender difference in outcome </plain></SENT>
