<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3D contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) acquisition was modified to create two separate k-space data sets to encode the arterial and venous enhancement signals individually after contrast agent injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following an automated detection of contrast arrival, the central k-space views corresponding to the arterial phase were acquired for the first eight seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A full elliptical-centric acquisition was then acquired for the venous phase and the missing views in the periphery of the first k-space data set were copied from the venous phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 patients underwent this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Image quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (<z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi>) were determined in both intracranial systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two 3D image sets were generated for the arterial and venous intracranial systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both sets have high quality images that are clinically diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNR and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="50807">CNR</z:chebi> were high in both sets, so that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the major vessels were visible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This technique provides images with high spatial resolution for both arterial and venous intracranial systems using a single contrast injection </plain></SENT>
