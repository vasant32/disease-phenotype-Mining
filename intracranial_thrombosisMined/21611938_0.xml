<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thromboses</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep venous thromboses</z:e>; many asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep venous thromboses</z:e> are detected in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> by instrumental screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of asymptomatic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) screened by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 46 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, during the induction phase of the AIEOP ALL 2000 protocol, were stratified into 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group "A" cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were suspected following the appearance of suggestive signs and symptoms and confirmed by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography; in group "B" children underwent a screening by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venography, at set times, in absence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We observed one cerebral thromboembolic event in both groups; we found no differences between early detecting asymptomatic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> among monitored and not monitored patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not seem to suggest a screening for asymptomatic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in children with ALL during the induction phase </plain></SENT>
