<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An adult woman diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> following a caesarean section was found to have severely prolonged thrombin and reptilase times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five other family members also had prolonged, but variable, thrombin and reptilase times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of purified fibrinogen on reducing <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE revealed an additional band, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> family members, which migrated immediately below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B beta band </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blotting indicated that this band was a gamma chain and endoglycosidase-F digestion established that it contained an additional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> side chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial acid hydrolysis localized the new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> to the C-terminus of the gamma chain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amplification of this region by PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing demonstrated a single base substitution altering the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 380 Lys (AAG) codon to Asn (AAT), producing a new Asn-Lys-Thr glycosylation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The propositus and one other family member were homozygous for this mutation but the remaining four family members were heterozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The polymerization of purified fibrin monomers from the propositus was grossly abnormal; however, the polymerization curve was almost normalized by the removal of terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the polymerization defect was primarily caused by additional negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> residues present on the new <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the D domain of purified fibrinogen established that calcium binding to the high affinity site remained unaffected by the bulky carbohydrate side chain or negatively charged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> residues </plain></SENT>
