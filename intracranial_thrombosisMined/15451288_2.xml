<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A very rare case of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> induced by ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: Six years earlier, this 68-year-old woman had undergone microvascular decompression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> during which the left vertebral artery, which compressed the exit zone of the trigeminal nerve, had been detached and fixed to the dura mater of the petrous bone with ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter she underwent microvascular decompression for left-side <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>; again ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six years later, she suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> because of rupture of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was referred to our hospital where coil embolization was attempted on the day following the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the left vertebral artery and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> could not be occluded completely, and she suddenly died 20 days later from rerupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first pathologic report of a ruptured de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> induced by ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that arterial wall damage by ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate may have contributed to the development of the de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
