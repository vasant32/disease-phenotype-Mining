<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been increasing the evidence on the significances of the measurements of LHRH, one of the hypothalamic hormones, but there are no report on endogenous LHRH levels in patients with internal diseases associated with gonadal dysfunction or intracranial diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, the radioimmunoassay of LHRH was established, and plasma LHRH levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> before and during haemodialysis, and the levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial diseases were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of immunoreactive LHRH in healthy adults were less than 7 pg/ml for men (n = 17) and less than 8 pg/ml for women (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels were increased in women in menstrual midcycle, postmenopausal period or in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000815'>hypergonadotropic hypogonadism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSF LHRH levels were less than 6.1 pg/ml in control subjects, and there were no difference between postmenopausal subjects and the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The immunoreactivities of CSF and plasma extracts were eluted in identical fractions with synthetic LHRH on Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and these dilutions gave a displacement curve parallel to that with the standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma LHRH levels were increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> before haemodialysis (11.1 +/- 1.4 pg/ml, mean +/- SE), and the levels were declined after the dialysis to 4.8 +/- 0.5 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These suggest that elevated plasma LHRH reflects the decreased feedback inhibition by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1384582" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary gonadal failure</z:e>, and might in turn be responsible at least in part for high concentrations of plasma LH in this condition, and that plasma LHRH is mainly not bound to plasma proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>LHRH levels of CSF and plasma in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial diseases, e.g. cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were often elevated abnormally, and these levels were decreased following the abatement of the diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These elevations are supposed to be the non-specific changes of this brain <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> suggesting the leakage from the damaged brain, but further studies are needed to clarify these potential significances </plain></SENT>
