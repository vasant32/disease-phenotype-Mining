<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and four patients with DDS, which causes secondary <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and two DDS patients were identical twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> within 3 months of birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In four DDS patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was not noted and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> developed between 7 months and 6 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these five <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> patients, one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and cytomegalovirus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and another patient died during dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequent intravenous albumin administration required, growth and development during infancy were varied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the nine patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and DDS, seven received renal transplantation and were alive with functioning grafts at the last follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Catch-up growth was observed in five patients after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five school-aged patients attended school and received adequate grades and two adults worked full-time </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> and DDS were diagnosed early after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and adequate treatment was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Growth and development after renal transplantation were relatively good </plain></SENT>
