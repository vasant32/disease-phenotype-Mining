<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo data suggest that activation of procarboxypeptidase U (proCPU) inhibits fibrinolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To investigate whether the extent of proCPU activation is related to efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In twelve patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who were treated with intravenous (n=7) or intra-arterial (n=5) thrombolysis, venous blood samples were taken at different time points before, during and after thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ProCPU and carboxypeptidase U (CPU, TAFIa) plasma concentrations were determined by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximal CPU activity (CPU(max)) and the percentage of proCPU consumption during thrombolytic therapy were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of the thrombolytic therapy were assessed by evolution of the clinical deficit, recanalisation, final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, thrombolysis-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No correlations between CPU(max) or proCPU consumption and patient or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> characteristics were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CPU(max) is associated with evolution of the clinical deficit and achieved recanalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ProCPU consumption is related to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, mortality and final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of patient and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> characteristics, CPU(max) and proCPU consumption during thrombolytic treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are parameters for therapeutic efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of the clinical applicability of these parameters and further investigation of the potential role for CPU inhibitors as adjunctive therapeutics during thrombolytic treatment may be of value </plain></SENT>
