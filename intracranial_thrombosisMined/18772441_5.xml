<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During intra-arterial revascularization, either guide catheter injections of contrast in the neck or microcatheter contrast injections (MCIs) at or beyond the site of an occlusion, can be used to visualize intracranial vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurointerventionalists vary widely in their use of MCIs for a given circumstance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that MCIs are a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) in the Interventional Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (IMS) I and II trials of combined intravenous/IA recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> arteriograms with M1, M2, and ICA terminus occlusions were reanalyzed (n=98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of MCIs within or distal to the target occlusion was assigned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure CTs were reviewed for contrast extravasation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast extravasation was defined as a hyperdensity suggestive of contrast (Hounsfield unit &gt;90) seen at 24 hours or present before 24 hours and persisting or replaced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this IMS subset, the rate of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> was 58% (57 of 98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More MCIs were seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> group (median=2 versus 1; P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Increased MCIs were associated with higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> rates (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MCIs remained associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in multivariable analysis (P=0.01) as did baseline CT <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>/mass effect, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, time to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator initiation, and Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> reperfusion score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MCIs were also associated with contrast extravasation in unadjusted and adjusted analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MCIs may risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in the setting of combined intravenous/intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy, possibly due to contrast toxicity or pressure transmission by injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>MCIs should be minimized whenever possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings will be tested prospectively in the IMS III trial </plain></SENT>
