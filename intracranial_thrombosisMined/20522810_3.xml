<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to investigate the clinical course, possible risk factors, and outcome of a cohort of neonatal patients with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and, second, to estimate the incidence in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 1999 to March 2009, a review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neonatal patients with sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from 6 tertiary neonatal intensive care units was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Population characteristics, clinical presentation, (prothrombotic) risk factors, neuroimaging, interventions, and neurodevelopment were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An estimated incidence was calculated based on the Netherlands Perinatal Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-two neonates were included (39 boys) with a median gestational age of 39 weeks (range, 30 to 42 weeks; 5 preterm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An assisted or complicated delivery occurred in 32 of 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms developed at a median postnatal age of 1.5 days (range, 0 to 28 days) and consisted mainly of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (29 of 52) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> cases were confirmed with MRI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multisinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was most common followed by superior sagittal sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FII G20210A mutation was present in 2 of 18 tested neonates (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation therapy (in 22 of 52) did not result in hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (median age, 19 months; range, 3 to 72 months), moderate to severe neurological sequelae were present in 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mortality was 10 of 52 (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A variable, although high yearly incidence of 1.4 to 12 per 100 000 term newborns was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a multifactorial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The estimated incidence in The Netherlands seems higher than reported elsewhere </plain></SENT>
