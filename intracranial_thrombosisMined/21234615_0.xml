<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were no visual/neurological deficits, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000873'>diabetes insipidus</z:hpo>, or episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The alteration in the flow dynamics of the circle of Willis due to the presence of PPTA may have been responsible for both the genesis of the giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as well as for the induction of thrombogenesis within its lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the digital subtraction angiogram showed complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and hormonal replacement therapy was effective in ensuring complete normalization of symptoms, the patient was unwilling to undergo surgical clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and removal of the suprasellar clot in an attempt to restore pituitary functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003348'>Hypopituitarism</z:mp> recurred when the patient stopped her hormonal supplementation therapy after 7Â years, and she again became symptom-free on restarting the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the first reported case in the literature of <z:mp ids='MP_0003348'>hypopituitarism</z:mp> consequent to a giant, thrombosed, sellar-suprasellar ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with an associated PPTA on the side of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
