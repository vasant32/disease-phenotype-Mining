<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the fundamental funduscopic findings, irregular constriction, narrowing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal bleeding</z:hpo> were high risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in due order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar reflex lateral displacement, irregular constriction, tapering, vertical displacement, white plaque and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal bleeding</z:hpo> were high risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in the order listed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sheathing of arteriole was significantly related to the occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was significant and highest in grade 3 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026708" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Scheie</z:e>'s hypertensive and Keith-Wagener's classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026708" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Scheie</z:e>'s hypertensive and Keith-Wagener's classifications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> revealed the highest O/E ratio but was insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As is to be expected, the higher the grade of each funduscopic finding and the classifications of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> findings, the higher the risk of occurrence of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three or more, bright red color and large plaque shape of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal bleeding</z:hpo> in the upper and lower temporal areas were more indicative of future cerebrovascular diseases than in other area, and one or two, dark red color or smaller <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure was significantly related to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>Albuminuria</z:mp> was also significantly related to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo> was not found to have an important relation to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The relationship between serum cholesterol level and cerebrovascular diseases was insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> were more important than the funduscopic findings for prospecting the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and on the contrary, the funduscopic findings were more important than systolic and diastolic blood pressure and other findings for prospecting the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
