<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one per cent of the study group were male and 53 (93%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011099'>spastic hemiplegia</z:hpo> compared with the control group, of whom 55% were male and 54 (32%) had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011099'>spastic hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 5 years 11 months (SD 5y 1mo) for the study group and 7 years 7 months (SD 4y 7mo) for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood spots on Guthrie cards or buccal swabs were used to test both groups and their mothers for the factor V Leiden (fVL) mutation, which predisposes carriers to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mothers were interviewed to gather antenatal, perinatal, demographic, and socio-economic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the fVL mutation in children with evidence of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and their mothers was not statistically different from the frequency in children with CP with other imaging findings and their mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the fVL mutation was significantly higher than the expected population frequency of 4% in the study group (10.5%, p=0.012) and in mothers of the control group (7.2%, p=0.036) </plain></SENT>
