<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms and severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we analysed the predictive value of clinical signs and symptoms and the contribution of D-dimer measurements for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated consecutive patients admitted with suspected CVT receiving non-invasive imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and symptom combination as well as D-dimer levels were evaluated regarding their diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 239 patients were included in this study, 170 (71%) were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 39 patients (16%) a CVT was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For identifying a CVT patients underwent either a venous CT-angiography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No combination of symptoms either alone or together with the D-dimer measurements had a sensitivity and positive predictive value as well as negative predictive value and specificity high enough to serve as red flag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>D-dimer testing produced rates of 9% false positive and of 24% false negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For D-dimer values a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC = 0.921; CI: 0.864-0.977) were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase of sensitivity above 0.9 results in a relevant decrease in specificity; a sensitivity of 0.9 matches a specificity value of 0.9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This corresponds to a D-dimer cut-off level of 0.16 Î¼g/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Imaging as performed by venous CT-angiography or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography has a 1 to 2 in 10 chance to detect CVT when typical symptoms are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>D-dimer measurements are of limited clinical value because of false positive and negative results </plain></SENT>
