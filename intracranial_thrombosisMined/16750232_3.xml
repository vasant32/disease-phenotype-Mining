<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The severity of envenoming from Bothrops lanceolatus is determined by the development of cerebral, myocardial or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034074" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary infarctions</z:e>, and occasionnaly by serious local envenoming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Introduction of specific antivenom has resulted in a dramatic improvement in the prognosis of this envenoming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Against this background, we report 3 recent cases of patients bitten by B. lanceolatus who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> despite early administration of antivenom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 1991 a protocol was designed to apply the same evaluation and treatment to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> envenomed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical results have been continuously monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between April 1993 and July 2003, 128 envenomed patients (age 6-83 (mean 45) years) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, thrombotic complication or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in patients who were given early antivenom therapy--up to 6h following the bite--and 126 patients recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between August 2003 and October 2004, 10 additional patients (18-66 (mean 46) years) were given antivenom at the time of admission at hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 3 developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> within 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of antivenom was tested on mouse, and found to be lower than specified by the manufacturer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our data shows that recently the antivenom may have lost some of its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms include variability in venom composition or loss of activity of the antibodies produced more than 15 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The question is whether we should attempt to produce improved antivenom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This could include activity against the venom of Bothrops caribbaeus from the neighbouring island of St Lucia, which shares a monophyletic group with B. lanceolatus and whose venom produces a similar thrombotic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prevention of systemic vessels <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> remains the main therapeutic challenge of B. lanceolatus envenoming in Martinique </plain></SENT>
