<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical charts of 45 paediatric patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> otomastoiditis at the ORL Department of the University of Brescia (Italy) between January 1994 and March 2005 and to discuss the diagnostic workup and the outcome of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six males and 19 females were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of them (28.9%) presented an intracranial complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only three of them were not operated upon; one received a ventilation tube (VT); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the others underwent a mastoidectomy within 48-72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty out of 32 uncomplicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> were treated conservatively and the remaining 12 underwent myringotomy+/-VT, associated with a mastoidectomy in 9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Antibiotics alone or with VTs achieved a full recovery in 28 out of 32 uncomplicated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy resolved the disease in 13 patients (9 with complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In severe complications, a canal wall down (CWD) (n=2) or an intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy (n=7) were preferred, based on the extent of the lesions and the degree of hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children recovered completely at 1 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the uncomplicated cases that were operated upon, the mean hospital stay was 7.8 days (versus 4.3 days for the conservative group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In children with intracranial complications the mean hospital stay was 12.8 days, significantly less than the four non-surgical patients, who remained hospitalized for an average of 18 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> can fully recover with conservative treatment or myringotomy+VTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Immediate surgical treatment is indicated for intracranial complications, if the neurological conditions are not critical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A simple mastoidectomy+/-tympanoplasty is warranted in: (1) exteriorization, if the child is older than 30 months or &gt;15 kg of weight, (2) intracranial complications (combined with a neurosurgical procedure as needed) and (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
