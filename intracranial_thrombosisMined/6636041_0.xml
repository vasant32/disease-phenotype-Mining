<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(1) AT-III levels assayed by both biological and immunological methods showed a gradual decrease with increasing age, and levels in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were lower than those in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) AT-III in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> decreased slowly after administration of urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After administration of aspirin (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>), however, AT-III levels increased presumably due to inhibition of coagulation activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) Both biological activities and antigen amounts of AT-III increased after administration of an AT-III preparation, but the measured value, especially that of biological activity, was dissociated from the expected one, due to changes of the coagulation system after an operation </plain></SENT>
