<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 2001-5 to 2002-8, 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were treated with intraaterial thrombolysis followed by intra-cerebral stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>9 located in middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), 10 located in basal artery (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each patient, intraarterial thrombolysis of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or BA was applied at first, stent angioplasty was applied at the stenosis left after the thrombolysis by using the stent for coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the 19 patients left stenosis after intraaterial thrombolysis, and the average stenosis was 85% in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the operation of stent, the images showed the vascular is smooth and had no stenosis left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms were disappeared or improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> formation in the stent occurred on 1 patient 24 hours after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> never occurred in the left 18 patients then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TCD follow up showed blood flow is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is feasibility of intraaterial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> followed by intra-cerebral stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>And it is valid for preventing occlusion again of the vessel and decreasing the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> occurring </plain></SENT>
