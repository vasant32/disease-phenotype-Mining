<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The prothrombin gene variant G20210A was first described as a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, and recently for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, although reported cases had other concomitant risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASES: A 33 years old woman, with no previous vascular nor thrombotic risk factors, was admitted with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of superior longitudinal, lateral and sigmoid right sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The father had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> 3 years before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One year later, the 29 year old sister of the proband, developed massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, when she was 8 months pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Laboratory investigations showed elevated anticardiolipin antibodies titer in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin activity was in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin gene mutation G 20210A was detected in the 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As the presence of more than one thrombophilic factor (in the reported case, prothrombin G20210A mutation and anticardiolipin antibodies) increases the likehood of a thrombotic event, it is useful to screen for thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e>, even when other vascular risks are present, and vice versa </plain></SENT>
