<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case-series study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children undergoing such transplants in our institute was conducted Six children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> were diagnosed at a median age of 1.5 years and CBT was performed at a median age of 5.5 years (range 2-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six donors consisted of three HLA-identical siblings, one two-allele, one three-antigen mismatched sibling, and one one-allele mismatched unrelated cord blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median number of nucleated cells infused was 2.83 x 10(7)/kg (range 1.49-5.3); the median number of CD34+ cells infused was 1.94 x 10(5)/kg (range 0.2-5.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, two patients had complete donor engraftment; three had mixed chimerism (MC); one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and neutropenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the two complete donor-engrafted patients, two developed grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) which responded well to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the three mixed-chimeric patients, two were clinically cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 7 months (range 2-30), five children survived and have done well with transfusion-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Umbilical cord blood provides a reasonable option for hematopoietic stem cell source to transplant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e> diseases and the outcome in the present study was good </plain></SENT>
