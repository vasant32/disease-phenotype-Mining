<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical diagnosis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, as well as investigations into the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, hinge on inferences from the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an MRI-based system of topographic and volumetric analysis that considers distribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with respect to neuroanatomic structures, superficial and deep perfusion compartments, and gray and white matter tissue types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRI-based 3-dimensional topographic and volumetric analysis of presumed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was performed months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event in 21 subjects ranging in age from 34 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The topography of infarction was greatly variable, with virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory involved in at least 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 14, there was involvement of the M1 as well as the M2 through M4 territories; in 6, there was involvement of only the M2 through M4 territories; and in 2, there was involvement of only the M1 territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The volumes varied from 3.1 to 256 cm3, corresponding approximately to a range of 1% to 90% of the total <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The system of topographic and volumetric analysis is generally applicable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the forebrain where the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> is visualized in MRI, independent of vascular territory, clinical correlates, and interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results emphasize the variety of topographic patterns and lesion volumes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intended long-range applications include correlation of outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with predictions from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging and investigations of the potential benefit of therapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
