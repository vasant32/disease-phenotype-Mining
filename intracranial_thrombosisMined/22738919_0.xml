<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is a unique form of brain plasticity that is strongly stimulated after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate the morphological properties of new granule cells, which are born and develop after the ischemic insult, and query whether these adult-born neurons properly integrate into the pre-existing hippocampal circuitries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two well-established models were used to induce either small cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (photothrombosis model) or large territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>New granule cells were labeled 4 days after the initial insult by intrahippocampal injection of a retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein and newborn neurons were morphologically analyzed using a semiautomatic Neurolucida system and confocal laser scanning microscopy at 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 5% to 10% of newborn granule cells displayed significant morphological abnormalities comprising additional basal dendrites and, after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, also ectopic cell position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of morphological abnormalities was higher after large territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and seems to depend on the severity of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increased portion of mushroom spines in aberrant neurons suggests stable synaptic integration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, poststroke generated granule cells with regular appearance also demonstrate alterations in dendritic complexity and spine <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The remarkable stimulation of dentate neurogenesis after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> coincides with an increased rate of aberrantly integrated neurons, which may contribute to functional impairments and, hypothetically, favor pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001546" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">adjustment disorders</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> often seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
