<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study population comprised 2705 unrelated Japanese individuals (1244 men, 1461 women), including 636 subjects (372 men, 264 women) with ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with ACI and controls either had or did not have conventional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genotypes for 202 polymorphisms of 152 candidate genes were determined by a method that combines polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes with suspension array technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis and a stepwise forward selection procedure revealed that 11 different polymorphisms were significantly (P &lt; 0.005) associated with ACI in women or men or in individuals with or without hyper-tension, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>: the 584C--&gt;T polymorphism of LIPG, 5665G--&gt;T of EDN1, and G--&gt;A of CCL11 in women; 677C--&gt;T of MTHFR, 1323C--&gt;T of ITGB2, 3932T--&gt;C of APOE, and -231A--&gt;G of EDNRA in men; -572 G --&gt;C of IL6 in hypertensive individuals; -403G--&gt;A of CCL5 and G--&gt;A of COMT in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>; and 3932T--&gt; C of APOE and A--&gt;G of TNFSF4 in diabetic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms associated with ACI may thus differ between women and men as well as among individuals with different risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratification of subjects on the basis of sex or conventional risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may therefore be important in order to achieve the personalized prevention of ACI with the use of genetic information </plain></SENT>
