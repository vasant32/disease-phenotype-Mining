<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study describes both recovery and compensation of forelimb use in a reach-to-eat (skilled reaching) task following small photothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats were pretrained before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and then assessed using endpoint measures and biometric movement analysis during rehabilitation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological and MRI analysis indicated that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> consisted of a small lesion surrounded by cortex featuring scattered cell loss, likely of the large pyramidal cells that characterize the forelimb region of motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reduced reaching success, especially on the most demanding measure of success on first reach attempts, in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period, but with rehabilitation, performance returned to pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reach movements as assessed by biometric measures were severely impaired acutely but displayed significant recovery chronically although this recovery was not complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that not only do rats show post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compensation in skilled reaching but they can also display functional recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that recovery is mediated by the spared neurons in the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region of forelimb motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate the utility of a small lesion model for studying post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> neural and behavioral change and support the view that optimal post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment should be directed toward limiting tissue loss </plain></SENT>
