<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the PS has been the most promising mechanical thrombectomy device in terms of recanalization rates, even the PS cannot recanalize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Under such circumstances, we simply modified the PS, identified certain advantages, and applied this modification as a primary technique for recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe and discuss the technical details and results of our preliminary experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 22 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to large-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who underwent modified thrombectomy by using the PS for recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct wedging between the tip of the reperfusion catheter and the proximal part of the clot followed by forceful suction by using a 20- or 50-mL syringe is a unique feature of this technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>What is distinctive is that this does not require use of a separator or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> treated vessels (100%) were successfully recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A TICI scale of 2b or 3 was achieved in 81.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 3-month favorable functional outcome (mRS score, 0-2) was achieved in 45.5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only procedural complication was a transient dissection of the proximal ICA, which developed while advancing the guide catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Forced-suction thrombectomy is a simple modification of the PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our data, this technique allows safe and effective revascularization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> large-vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, for achieving the best outcome, the modified PS technique is proposed as a viable option for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management, either by itself or in conjunction with other devices or drugs </plain></SENT>
