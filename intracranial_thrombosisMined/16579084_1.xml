<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 73 inpatients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were randomly divided into a control group of 34 cases and a treatment group of 39 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The content of FIB and DD in plasma was detected before treatment and on the 7th and 14th days after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: FIB content in plasma after treatment was lower than that before treatment in the control group (P&lt;0.01) and more remarkable in the treatment group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an obvious difference in DD content before and after treatment in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DD content on the 7th and 14th days after treatment in the treatment group was obviously higher than that in the control group (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Chinese medicines for promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis can reduce the FIB content in plasma of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, raise the DD content in plasma, cause the peak of DD content appear earlier and obviously improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> of blood in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
