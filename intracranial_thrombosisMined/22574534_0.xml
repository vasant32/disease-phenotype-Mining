<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data from internal medicine candidates who performed clinical part of RCPT board certifying examination in academic year 2008 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each candidate, scores from pair of examiners for each of the long case was stratified based on disease category according to the course syllabus into 3 groups; very common, common and uncommon diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scores also categorized according to difficulty level subjectively and rated by the examiners into 3 levels; easy, moderate and difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean scores in each group of encounters were compared using ANOVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 21 examination centers involved with 1,840 number of encounters by 232 candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 437 patients that have been used for the long case, common scenarios (27.6% of the total) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, bronchogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean and SD of scores from the very common, common and uncommon diseases were 75.5 +/- 11.6, 75.6 +/- 10.6 and 74.7 +/- 11.3 respectively, with no statistical significant difference between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean and SD of scores from the easy, moderate and difficult cases were 76.1 +/- 10.5, 74.8 +/- 11.0, 75.5 +/- 10.9 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The moderate group has the lowest score with a statistical significant difference from other groups (p = 0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In current RCPT long case examination, difficulty of the case appears to contribute to variation in scores derived from the examiners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measures for score adjustment and examiner calibration should be implemented in the future </plain></SENT>
