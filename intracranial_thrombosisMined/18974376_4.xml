<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent ischemic events are known to occur during diagnostic and interventional endovascular procedures between 10% and 69% of the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of silent and symptomatic ischemic events in the surgically treated population is not known, although atherosclerotic changes of intracranial vessels or within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> wall or neck area are seen often during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with unruptured and ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by microsurgical clipping were prospectively evaluated with MRI using diffusion-weighted imaging sequences before and within 24 hours after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated clinically before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During surgery, the overall and maximal time of temporary occlusion as well as the total number of temporary and finally applied clips was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images were analyzed with determination and characterization of diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with 51 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One symptomatic and 5 silent ischemic lesions were found in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This represents a risk of silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of 9.8% per treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and a risk of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most significant risk factor in increasing order was: age (P&lt;0.05), presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (P&lt;0.05), number of final clips applied (P&lt;0.05), number of temporary clips used (P&lt;0.01), total time of temporary clip occlusion (P&lt;0.001), and maximal time of temporary occlusion (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of silent and symptomatic ischemic events during microsurgical clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> seems to be low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microsurgical clipping is safe and should continue to be strongly considered as a treatment option </plain></SENT>
