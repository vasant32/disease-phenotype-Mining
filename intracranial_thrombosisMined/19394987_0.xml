<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> is used for first-line treatment in association with symptomatic and etiologic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite adequate anticoagulation, the condition may deteriorate in some patients warranting the use of local thrombolysis (LT) known for good efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But there are few cases and trials upon which to base guidelines for the use of LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical and radiological records of patients with CVT was managed in the Caen hospital over a six-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared clinical factors of poor prognosis and radiological findings according to treatment delivered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients are treated for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LT was performed in eight of them; dose-adjusted intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> was the only treatment in the 28 others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was achieved in two thirds of the patients with functional sinus patency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on an analysis of the radiological data of the 36 patients, we propose a summary of radiological risk factors associated with a worsening condition despite adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Based on our experience and a review of the literature which includes 98 previous cases, LT appears to be a relative effective end safe procedure even in the presence of a hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The treatment by LT should be considered in patients who present clinical criteria of gravity and radiological risk factors associated with failure of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of LT remains to be determined in a randomized trial comparing <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> alone and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> associated with LT </plain></SENT>
