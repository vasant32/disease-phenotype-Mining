<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study was conducted to provide baseline data on patterns of cerebrovascular disease incidence in the community of Washington County, Maryland, over two time intervals--1969-1971 and 1974-1976--and to evaluate any temporal trends with regard to their possible relation to reported declines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the statistically significant changes in incidence between 1969-1971 and 1974-1976 were a decline in the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and a concomitant increase in frequency of cerebrovascular disease-unspecified, most likely a reflection of a change in diagnostic terminology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the findings of a significant decrease in incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages over 55 years and both sexes) and a non-significant decrease in incidence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types combined among those in the oldest age category between the two study periods support the role of changing incidence rates in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is clear, however, that monitoring of this community over a longer period of time will be necessary before the validity of these trends can be established and their causes elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The need for more complete recording of historical data and clinical findings on admission, as well as adherence to standardized diagnostic and classification protocols was underscored by this study </plain></SENT>
