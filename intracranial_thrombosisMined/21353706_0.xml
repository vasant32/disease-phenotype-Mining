<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Contrast-enhanced (CE) 3D magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and CE 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequences are increasingly commonly used methods for evaluation of the intracranial venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare CE MRV, 2D time-of-flight (TOF) MRV and MP-RAGE sequences at 3 T for visualization of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with suspected or known <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were examined prospectively by TOF MRV, CE MRV and MP-RAGE sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 11 consecutive patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women; mean age, 42.5 years; age range, 25-70 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, scores according to overall image quality, and presence or absence (score P) and differentiation (score D) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measurements, overall image quality ranged from good to excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 20 of 52 venous structures (38.5%), score P was the same on TOF MRV, CE MRV and MP-RAGE sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>Venous thrombosis</z:hpo> was definitely or almost definitely present or absent with TOF MRV in 20 of 52 (38.5%), with CE MRV in 97 of 99 (97.9%) and with MP-RAGE sequences in 86 of 99 (86.9%) venous structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> venous structures with uncertain diagnosis on TOF MRV, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was definitely or almost definitely present or absent on CE MRV and MP-RAGE sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was better on CE MRV (score D: 3.33) than on MP-RAGE sequences (score D: 2.78), followed by TOF MRV (score D: 1.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CE MRV was superior to TOF MRV and MP-RAGE sequences in visualizing cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
