<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 160 patients, who were able to receive drug treatment within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received either 60 mg fasudil or a placebo (saline) by intravenous injection over 60 min, twice daily for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end points were neurological status at 2 weeks after the start of treatment, and clinical outcome at 1 month after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fasudil treatment resulted in significantly greater improvements in both neurological functions (p=0.0013), and clinical outcome (p=0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no serious adverse events reported in the fasudil group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average trough value (12 h values) of active metabolite hydroxyfasudil, another RKI, in healthy elderly volunteers receiving 60 mg of fasudil was 0.077 microM-a concentration well above that needed to inhibit Rho-kinase (0.025-0.05 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with fasudil within 48 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> significantly improved the patient's clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study found fasudil to be a useful and safe drug for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further evaluations, for example, 3-month functional outcomes in a larger clinical trial, may help to define the efficacy of fasudil in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
