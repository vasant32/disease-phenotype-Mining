<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Factor V Leiden (FVL) and Factor II (FII) G20210A represent common risk factors for thromboembolic (TE) events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In children, both venous and arterial TE-events have been associated with the presence of FVL and FII G20210A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most heterozygous children with TE-events other prothrombotic factors can usually be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case reports of children with homozygous FVL, including 3 patients described here, suggest that this genotype may convey a particulary high risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, prospective data about the type and frequency of TE-events in such children are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We have initiated a prospective neonatal cohort study for the homozygous and double heterozygous genotypes for FVL and FII G20210A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probands and the heterozygous controls are identified by neonatal screening that involves &gt; 98% of the children born in Berlin and are followed up in a special out-patient clinic to document details of the clinical history, developmental parameters and the occurrence of TE-events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide controlled and unbiased information about the clinical significance of the homozygous and double heterozygous genotypes of these mutations </plain></SENT>
