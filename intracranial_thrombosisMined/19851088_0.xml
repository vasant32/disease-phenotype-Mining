<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present article, we report a 58-year-old man coming to our emergency department presenting with left temporal throbbing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and right hemianopia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the brain revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> over the left occipital area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the unusual location of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, magnetic resonance venography was performed, revealing absence of venous flow over the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses suggestive of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He received <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy for 6 months and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We feel that a high index of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in an uncommon site caused by CVT, even if risk factors of CVT are not present, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated as promptly as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure to recognize the signs of CVT could result in inappropriate management and suboptimal secondary prophylaxis strategies, which could affect the patient's clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
