<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at developing a laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) device suitable for long-term cortical cerebral blood flow (cCBF) measurement in awake, freely moving rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The device included a flow probe adapter for permanent fixation to the skull bone and a connector that held the flow probe in the adapter in exactly the same position during repeated cCBF recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this LDF recording system, cCBF values were stable and unaltered in awake, freely moving rats up to 4 days after operation compared with initial recordings during anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated cCBF measurements in rats after transient removal and reattachment of the flow probe revealed a coefficient of variation of 7.0-17.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The LDF recording system was applied to rats subjected to a photothrombotic ring <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>cCBF in the region-at-risk declined to 59-34-26-33% of baseline values (P &lt; 0.01) at 1-2-24 48 h after irradiation with gradually restored cCBF values of 56-87% at 72-96 h post-irradiation (P &lt; 0.01 vs. 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transcardial carbon black perfusion examination of the brains confirmed the sustained hypoperfusion in the region at risk up to 48 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by a consistently occurring late spontaneous reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a novel laser-Doppler cortical CBF recording system has been set up that allows stable long-term cortical CBF follow-up in awake, freely moving rats </plain></SENT>
