<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients on hormonal therapy who develop CVST varies widely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical features, risk factors and outcome by sex and by hormone-related risk factors among a large cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed records of 108 consecutive patients with CVST at a tertiary hospital in Calgary between 1999 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Descriptive statistics were used for between group comparisons (men, women with hormone-related risk factors and women without hormone-related risk factors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Females made up 62% of patients, half of whom were on systemic hormonal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men and women without hormonal risk factors were older at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Oral contraceptive use was the major risk factor in women (45%) while concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> was the most common predisposing factor in men (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complications were frequent and overall mortality was 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Persisting deficits at discharge were more common in men (54% vs. 35% and 32%, p=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend for women with hormone-related risk factors to have less residual focal neurologic deficit than the other groups (5% vs. 15% and 17%, p=0.051) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There are differences between sexes in the presentation, risk factors and outcome of patients with CVST </plain></SENT>
