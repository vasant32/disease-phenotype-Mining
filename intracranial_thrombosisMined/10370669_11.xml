<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Nine patients with bilobular multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> was treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of nodules was 6.0 +/- 3.9 (range: 2-13), and the size was 2.1 +/- 1.0 cm (range: 0.5-4.8 cm) in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RFA was performed using a RF generator operating at 460 kHz with a 15-gauge, 4-prong custom RF needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment temperature was kept at 90-110 degrees C for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-Fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) was administered by weekly 750-1250 mg/body/5 h as the regimen of HAI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 15.2-month follow-up period, 6 of 9 patients survived more than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the 6 survived more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum CEA level in 5 patients dropped from 24.5 +/- 9.5 ng/ml to 10.3 +/- 5.5 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Local recurrence was observed in 5 patients and new lesions in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extrahepatic recurrence was observed in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no serious complications but one HAI-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined RFA with HAI would be effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This modality provides a new option for the treatment of multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494165" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">liver metastases</z:e> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527249,C0009402" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colorectal cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
