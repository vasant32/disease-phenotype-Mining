<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the association between deficient <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>-binding lectin (MBL) genotypes and arterial thrombotic events in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with SLE of Hispanic, African American, and Caucasian ethnicity from LUMINA (LUpus in MInorities, NAture versus nurture), a multiethnic, longitudinal study of outcome, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial thrombotic events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo>, or tissue loss and/or peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo>) that occurred after diagnosis were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping for MBL gene polymorphisms was performed and their distribution was compared between patients who did and did not have thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 58 events (21 cardiovascular, 27 cerebrovascular, and 10 peripheral vascular) in 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who had thrombotic events were older and were more likely to be smokers, to have more severe disease, and to have accrued more damage overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, a larger proportion of these patients had C-reactive protein values in the highest quintile of distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in arterial thrombotic events was found in patients homozygous for MBL-deficient alleles compared with others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were seen within ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Caucasians who developed potential thrombotic events exhibited a higher frequency of MBL-deficient alleles, but the difference was not statistically significant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> events together or for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, when only the cerebrovascular events were considered, the difference became statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age, smoking, and measures of activity and damage were associated with arterial thrombotic events in patients with SLE, but MBL-deficient genotypes were not, with cerebrovascular events in Caucasians being the exception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The relationship between MBL-variant alleles and arterial thrombotic events may exist only within select ethnic groups and event types </plain></SENT>
