<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The role of antithrombotic therapy in secondary prevention after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the available literature suggests that <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> is superior to aspirin, aspirin is currently the more widely used drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the efficacy and safety of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, aspirin, or both after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a randomized, multicenter trial in 3630 patients, 1216 received <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (in a dose intended to achieve an international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.8 to 4.2), 1206 received aspirin (160 mg daily), and 1208 received aspirin (75 mg daily) combined with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (in a dose intended to achieve an INR of 2.0 to 2.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of observation was four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary outcome, a composite of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, nonfatal reinfarction, or thromboembolic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, occurred in 241 of 1206 patients receiving aspirin (20.0 percent), 203 of 1216 receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (16.7 percent; rate ratio as compared with aspirin, 0.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.95; P=0.03), and 181 of 1208 receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and aspirin (15.0 percent; rate ratio as compared with aspirin, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.83; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between the two groups receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Episodes of major, nonfatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were observed in 0.62 percent of patients per treatment-year in both groups receiving <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and in 0.17 percent of patients receiving aspirin (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>, in combination with aspirin or given alone, was superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of composite events after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> but was associated with a higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
