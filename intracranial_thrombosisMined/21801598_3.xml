<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Stent-based techniques may allow rapid arterial recanalization in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present our experience using a self-expanding stent to achieve a transient bypass, and then as a thrombectomy device, with no permanent stent implantation, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients (mean age 55 years, range 35-71 years) presented with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> secondary to large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of &gt;17, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or early infarction, and poor collateral supply to the affected parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a stent (Solitaire, ev3, Irvine, CA, USA) was deployed across the entire occluded segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiogram was performed to evaluate the reconstituted flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The balloon of the guide catheter was inflated for proximal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The partially deployed stent was slowly pulled back (mechanical thrombectomy step) under continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suction was repeated to ensure the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> of any clot remnants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases, complete recanalization (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Revascularization and Reperfusion Score of 3) was achieved in &lt;60 minutes after femoral access, and a single thrombectomy attempt was sufficient to achieve clot removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No stent was permanently implanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scores were 0-2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at a mean 1-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach allowed three desired effects: rapid endovascular revascularization, clot removal, and no need of leaving a permanent implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our preliminary experience this simple and rapid stent-based mechanical thrombectomy technique has had an unprecedented success rate </plain></SENT>
