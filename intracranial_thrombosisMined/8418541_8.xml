<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase hydrolyzes platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16870">sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It also hydrolyzes oxidized derivatives of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49183">phosphatidylcholine</z:chebi> that have a short-chain acyl residue at the sn-2 position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This enzyme may act mainly in the degradation of oxidized <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> and may play a role in maintaining erythrocyte deformability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the activity of red cell membrane platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and studied the relation of the enzyme activity to red cell deformability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enzyme activity was measured in the detergent extract of red cell membranes from 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and 38 age-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Red cell filterability, an index of red cell deformability, was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The enzyme activity in patients and control subjects was 100 +/- 74 and 148 +/- 128 nmol/g protein per minute (2.68 +/- 2.11 and 3.79 +/- 2.46 pmol/10(9) cells per minute) (mean +/- SD), respectively, and the difference was significant (p &lt; 0.05 by the Mann-Whitney U test, two-sided test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enzyme activity was correlated positively with red cell filterability in the patients (n = 20, r = 0.565, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Red blood cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients have lower levels of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity when compared with those from healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may result in the accumulation of oxidized <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in the cell membrane and lead to impaired red cell deformability in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
