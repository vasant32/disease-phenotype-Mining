<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Destruction of microbubbles by transcutaneous low-frequency ultrasound (LFUS) has been used to lyse adjacent clot and recanalize acutely thrombosed vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LFUS with intraarterial microbubbles has been shown to lyse cerebral clot rapidly in pigs without thrombolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that intravenous platelet-targeted microbubbles with LFUS may be a rapid noninvasive technique to recanalize thrombosed intracerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After angiography, 0.5 cc of autogenous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was injected into 1 ascending pharyngeal artery of a pig, occluding it and the rete mirabile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These vessels connect the carotid to the internal carotid and are the main cerebral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saline control or intravenous decafluorobutane-sonicated <z:chebi fb="10" ids="4167">dextrose</z:chebi> albumin microbubbles tagged with a subtherapeutic quantity of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 2b/3a receptor inhibitor eptifibatide (75 U/kg plus 12 cc of microbubbles administered over 21 minutes), or eptifibatide control, was given with transcutaneous temporal LFUS (1 MHz at 2.0 W/cm2) for 24 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography followed with scoring of declotting and flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same protocol was repeated on the contralateral side with the other test fluid so each animal received a saline control and either tagged microbubble or eptifibatide alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen pigs completed the protocol with a mean clot age of 4.6 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using tagged microbubbles, 6 of 8 achieved success compared with 0 of 7 receiving eptifibatide alone (P=0.007) and 1 of 15 receiving saline alone (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous platelet-targeted microbubbles combined with transcranial LFUS can rapidly open <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracranial thrombotic occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further development for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> therapy is justified </plain></SENT>
