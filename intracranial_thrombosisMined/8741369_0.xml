<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was done to clarify relationships between the degree of periventricular lucency (PVL), and lesions in the carotid arteries and the legs as detected with B-mode ultrasonography and the ankle pressure index, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the distribution of PVL on computed tomography, 45 patients were divided into 2 groups: 22 patients with diffuse PVL (from the periventricular white matter to the subcortical area, DPVL group) and 23 patients with PVL localized in the frontal deep white matter (LPVL group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Plaque, defined as a thickened intima-media complex of 2.1 mm or more, was divided into two types; mural plaque and nodular plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was more common in the DPVL group than in control groups, which consisted of 70 age-matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> without PVL (CTH group) and 50 controls with neither PVL nor cerebrovascular lesions (NCT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the DPVL group met the diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger's disease</z:e> proposed by Bennett <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of low API indices (&lt; 0.9) in the DPVL group (45%) was significantly higher than that in the NCT group, and it was slightly higher than that in the LPVL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid lesions, mainly nodular plaques, were seen in 82% of patients in the DPVL group and in 74% of those in the LPVL group; these percentages were significantly higher than those in the CTH (49%) and NCT (40%) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, bilateral carotid lesions were more common in the DPVL group than in the other three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of PVL correlated with lesions in the carotid arteries and the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These correlations suggest that the arterial lesions not only resulted from a risk factor (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) for PVL, but also promoted PVL by causing extra- and intra-cranial arterial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they imply that LPVL is a precusor to DPVL </plain></SENT>
