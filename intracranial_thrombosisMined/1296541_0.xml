<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In prospective studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cause mortality is often increased at low and high cholesterol levels because of the inverse relationships of this factor with cardiovascular mortality (positive) and non-cardiovascular mortality (negative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increases proportionally to serum cholesterol levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations, including those with low cholesterol levels, in both sexes and at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship with cerebrovascular mortality seems to depend on the clinical feature: increased mortality rate due to cerebral haemorrhage in patients with low serum cholesterol and a positive correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> is generally negatively correlated to serum cholesterol levels with a significant increase in mortality in patients with a low serum cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This relationship often becomes less significant as the time between measurement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality due to violent causes is not usually related to serum cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The multitude of possible causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> makes any causal interpretation of data illusory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimentation by unifactorial primary prevention trials is essential for any etiological research but none of the trials performed to date was designed to analyse the effect of lowering serum cholesterol on global or coronary mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
