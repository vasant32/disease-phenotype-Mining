<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> were studied; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a decreased platelet count following the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sequential studies of three patients disclosed changes in plasma vWF multimer pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient who was studied serially from 2 days before to 1 day after the event, had an increase in unusually large plasma vWF multimers that disappeared after the complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other two patients who were studied at presentation subsequently showed a decrease in plasma large vWF multimers, especially remarkable in the patient having the sharpest decrease in platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No appreciable difference in vWF multimer pattern, when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pooled plasma, was found in the remaining two patients who were only studied at presentation, or in the seven controls who received the same treatment but did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Crossed immunoelectrophoretic analyses of two patients tested disclosed a right shift of immunoprecipitin line in one and a left shift in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the thrombotic complications resulted from platelet agglutination by plasma vWF </plain></SENT>
