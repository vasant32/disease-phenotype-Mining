<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, has been reported to cause increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic brain and protect against neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by inhibiting ROCK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ozagrel, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> A(2) synthase inhibitor, inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilatation, thereby increasing CBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluates the combination therapy of fasudil and ozagrel on focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> induced by middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each monotherapy of fasudil at 10 mg/kg i.p. and ozagrel at 30 mg/kg i.p. significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination therapy of fasudil (3 mg/kg i.p.) and ozagrel (10 mg/kg i.p.), which are noneffective doses, resulted in reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and the protective effect was observed up to 5 min, but not 3 h, after reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of combination treatment was antagonized by the treatment of a NOS inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-l-arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the combination treatment of fasudil and ozagrel exhibits additive effects for neuroprotection after MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the combination treatment of fasudil and ozagrel may be useful as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
