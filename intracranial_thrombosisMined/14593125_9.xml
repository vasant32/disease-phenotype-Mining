<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) "dot" sign consists of hyperdensity of an arterial structure, seen as a dot in the sylvian fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign has been proposed to indicate <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of M2 or M3 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches, analogous to the hyperdense middle cerebral artery (HMCA) sign indicating M1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign has not been validated previously against the gold standard of conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Noncontrast CT scans and immediately subsequent cerebral angiograms from 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT films were inspected for the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign and HMCA sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular findings on CT were compared with findings at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean patient age was 71 years; median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 16.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to CT was 125 minutes, and that from CT to angiography was 117 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the anterior circulation occlusions, M1 occlusions were noted in 28 patients, isolated M2 in 15, and isolated M3 in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One definite <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign was observed in 16.7% of patients, and an HMCA sign was observed in 13.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign performance in predicting the presence of M2 or M3 clot at angiography was as follows: sensitivity 38%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 68%, and overall accuracy 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign is a highly specific and moderately sensitive indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the M2/M3 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches, as validated by catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dot sign is a useful additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> CT marker </plain></SENT>
