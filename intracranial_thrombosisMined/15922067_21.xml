<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although pathological changes associated with post-lesion improvements have been widely investigated, it has not been resolved whether behavioral improvement represents true restoration of function (recovery) or development of new strategies (compensation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether early motor improvements after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reflect recovery or compensation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult female Wistar rats were trained to retrieve food pellets in a skilled reaching task prior to receiving a unilateral cortical infarction induced by photothrombosis in forelimb motor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were continuously tested in the reaching task up to 3 weeks after lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The end point measures revealed that reaching success rates remained at pre-lesion levels, however, qualitative analysis of reaching movements indicated permanent changes in forelimb movement patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar observations were made in a skilled walking task and a test for forelimb asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that lesion animals adopted alternative movement strategies in order to successfully perform the tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The changes in postoperative performance were compared to anatomical data in individual animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The finding that reaching success was not related to lesion size supports the idea that the degree of adaptive behavior after cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> depends on plastic properties of the remaining intact tissue </plain></SENT>
