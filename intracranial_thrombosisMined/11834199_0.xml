<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the presence of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> has been related to atheromatous degeneration of the arterial wall, in many cases the cause of their formation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system are generally due to mass effect with compression of adjacent structures or to ischemic events; exceptionally they are due to subarachnoidal haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a patient with symptoms suggestive of brainstem ischemic damage, in which neuroimaging showed a fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar artery with an intraaneurysmatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiaggregation did not prevent new ischemic events, so anticoagulation therapy was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient remained asymptomatic at 8 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment of fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is controversial; however, there are some evidences in the literature supporting that patients with ischemic events may be treated with long term anticoagulation, especially in cases of non-giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar system not accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in other sites </plain></SENT>
