<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and/or aspirin could lower the thromboembolic complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records over a 10-year period were reviewed in a retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 369 consecutive elective coil embolization procedures, 25 patients received no antiplatelet drugs, 86 received antiplatelet drugs only after embolization, and 258 received antiplatelet drugs before and after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic thromboembolic complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 60 days) occurred in 4 (16%) of 25 when no antiplatelet drugs were given, in 2 (2.3%) of 86 when antiplatelet drugs were administered only after embolization, and in 5 (1.9%) of 258 when antiplatelet drugs were administered before and after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower symptomatic thromboembolic complication rate in the patients who received any antiplatelet therapy was statistically significant (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clots were visible intraprocedurally in 5 (4.5%) of 111 when no antiplatelet drugs were administered before procedures and in 4 (1.6%) of 258 when they were (P value not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the 9 was symptomatic postprocedurally, but 7 were lysed or mechanically disrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extracerebral hemorrhagic complications occurred in 0 (0%) of 25 when no antiplatelet drugs were given and in 11 (3.2%) of 344 when they were (P value not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and/or aspirin significantly lowered the symptomatic thromboembolic complication rate of elective coil embolization of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were trends toward a lower rate of intraprocedural clot formation in patients given antiplatelet drugs before procedures and a higher hemorrhagic complication rate in patients given antiplatelet drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Benefits of antiplatelet therapy appear to outweigh risks </plain></SENT>
