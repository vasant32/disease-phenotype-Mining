<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In this study the frequency of inherited thrombophilic risk factors in a population of German CVT patients and their influence on clinical outcome were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients (age 37.1 +/- 16.3 years) with CVT were screened for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited coagulation disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> participants received a full clinical follow-up (mean follow-up period 4.8 +/- 6.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Inherited thrombophilic risk factors were identified in 9 (36%) of the 25 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four were found positive for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, 2 were heterozygous carriers of the prothrombin-G20210A-polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APC resistance proved to be a reliable screening method for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0584960" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor V Leiden mutation</z:e>, whereas genetic evaluation for protein S and C deficiencies failed to demonstrate any mutations despite the identification of 1 patient with a protein C and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered from a familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasminogen deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These 9 patients had a less favorable outcome (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that screening for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> should be an integral part in the diagnostic work up of CVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> tended to have a less favorable outcome, corroborating recommendations for a longer period of oral anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
