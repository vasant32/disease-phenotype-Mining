<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 35-year-old man sustained a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to the rupture of an anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A second angiogram taken 8 hours later demonstrated that the ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had thrombosed spontaneously with a small residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> stump at the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scans and conventional angiograms taken 2 days later demonstrated recanalization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, which was successfully treated by endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case differs from previous reports of spontaneously thrombosed ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> because the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> recanalized within 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus a thrombosed ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has the potential for recanalization, and should be considered at risk of further <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
