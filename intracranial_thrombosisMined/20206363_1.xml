<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 91 consecutive patients-treated in Helsinki University Central Hospital-who had non-invasively verified CVT and follow-up imaging at 4 months or later, or autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We categorized vessel status at follow-up as complete, partial, or no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete recovery was defined as a score of 0 on the modified Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 91 patients (median age, 36 years; 70% females), 43 (47%) achieved complete recanalization, in 31 (34%) patients recanalization was partial, and 17 (19%) had no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Males, patients aged &gt; or =37 years, and those with no identified risk factors for CVT had more frequently partial or no recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients aged &gt; or =37 years, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms (&gt;30 days), and those with no recanalization had worse outcome in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only increasing age associated with no recanalization (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08) when adjusted for age, sex, and number of causes for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increasing age (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.09) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (OR 9.41; 95% CI 1.02-87.07) predicted incomplete recovery or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> when adjusted for age, sex, mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and status of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was more common in patients with no recanalization (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Half of the patients after CVT had complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the univariate association, recanalization did not associate with poor outcome in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was more common in those with no recanalization </plain></SENT>
