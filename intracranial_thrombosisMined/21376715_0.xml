<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study is aimed at evaluating the potential association of the -403G/A (rs2107538) and -28C/G (rs2280788) polymorphisms of the RANTES gene promoter with the risk of atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) in Northern Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A total of 314 patients with ACI and 389 unrelated aged-matched healthy controls were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their genotypes of the RANTES gene promoter -403G/A (rs2107538) and -28C/G (rs2280788) were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) and multiplex SNaPshot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The potential association of genotyping and allele frequencies with ACI in this population was assessed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of -403AA genotype and A allele in ACI male patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P=0.007, P=0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female patients were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the -403AA genotype in males was significantly associated with an increased risk of ACI, even after adjusting for confounding factors (OR=4.344; 95% CI=1.969-9.582; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although there was no significant association of the -28C/G polymorphism with ACI, the A-(403)C-(28) haplotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of ACI in Han Chinese [OR=1.56, 95% CI=1.23-1.98, P&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the -403AA genotype and A allele of the RANTES promoter were associated with increased risk for the development of ACI in male Northern Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
