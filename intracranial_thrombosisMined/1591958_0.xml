<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ANAE activities of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> were much higher than those of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> significantly (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CSF cytochemical detection was obviously superior to routine CSF cytological examination in differentiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with clear CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that these results provided a simple inexpensive and relatively accurate method to differentiate hemorrhagic from ischemic cerebrovascular diseases in case of without CT </plain></SENT>
