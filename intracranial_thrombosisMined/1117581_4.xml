<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, narrowing of arteriole and irregular constriction were especially important indicators, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal bleeding</z:hpo> and lateral displacement were also valuable but less than narrowing and irregular constriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, arteriolar reflex was considered as the most valuable indicator, and irregular constriction, lateral displacement and white plaque were also important but less than arteriolar reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Narrowing of arteriole was most highly related with irregular constriction while the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal bleeding</z:hpo> and white plaque, and also the correlation between arteriolar reflex, vertical and lateral displacement and tapering were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significiant correlation among physical and laboratory findings was found only between systolic and diastolic blood pressure as far as analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Funduscopic findings by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026708" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Scheie</z:e>'s hypertensive and Keith-Wagener's classifications were highly correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Narrowing and irregular constriction were significantly correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal bleeding</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo> was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the additional information of each funduscopic finding, when evaluated with the physical and laboratory findings simultaneously, revealed that irregular constriction, lateral displacement and narrowing gave prominent additional information for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, while arteriolar reflex, lateral and vertical displacement and white plaque gave valuable information for the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy from these multivariate analyses that narrowing and irregular constriction may arise from a similar pathophysiological mechanism which brings out vasoconstriction and the resultant organic changes due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is also noticed that arteriolar reflex and A/V crossing phenomenon may come from the different pathophysiological mechanism related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It was stressed that detailed analyses of observer variability and evolution of funduscopic findings would be necessary </plain></SENT>
