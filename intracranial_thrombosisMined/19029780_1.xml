<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 52-year-old woman presented with a partially thrombosed giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery (VA) manifesting as a 3-month history of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> during hospitalization and underwent emergency surgery for surgical proximal clipping and ventricular drainage with decompressive suboccipital craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She underwent additional surgery for endovascular coil embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the affected distal VA on the 7th postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although she suffered transient lower cranial nerve pareses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, her neurological condition improved gradually and she returned home with only slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo> 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging obtained 28 months postoperatively revealed a remarkable decrease in the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as well as reduction of the mass effect on the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combined proximal clipping and internal trapping can solve the problems associated with treatment of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of VA by either direct surgery or endovascular surgery, and should be considered as a therapeutic option for giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the VA </plain></SENT>
