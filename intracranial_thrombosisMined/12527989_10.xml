<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, predictors of outcome are difficult to identify, because most studies suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in diagnostic findings and treatments, retrospective design, and recruitment bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in 55 consecutive patients with CVT admitted over a 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 42 women and 13 men, with a median age of 39 years (range 16-68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was performed with MRI in 53 patients, and angiography in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin scale (mRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 36 months (range: 12-60), 45 patients were independent (mRS 0-2), and 10 were dependent or dead (mRS 3-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 48 survivors, 7 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 6 motor deficits, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo>, 29 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> in 14, tension <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in 13, other in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The logistic regression analysis found focal deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> at time of diagnosis, as independent predictors of dependence or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at year 3, and isolated intra-cranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as an independent predictor of survival and independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates are low in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and focal deficits, and more than 80 % of survivors are independent after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 3/4 of survivors have residual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, despite a low mortality rate, CVT remains a serious disorder </plain></SENT>
