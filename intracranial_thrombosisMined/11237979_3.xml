<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fibrinolysis with local intraarterial urokinase infusion for basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has been associated with a low rate of spontaneous symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, even when patients have been treated late in the course of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because urokinase is presently unavailable in the United States, this study was undertaken to determine the frequency of spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in basilar artery fibrinolysis performed with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a retrospective review of our initial experience with cerebral fibrinolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> using intraarterial tPA, four cases of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doses of the fibrinolytic agent and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, angiographic findings, clinical courses, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications for these patients were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with those from a prior study of 20 similar consecutive patients treated with urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptom duration before treatment was unlimited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraarterial doses of tPA were 20 to 50 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients received full systemic anticoagulation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete basilar artery recanalization was achieved in 75% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients treated with tPA had angioplasty and stent placement for related high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in three (75%) of the four tPA-treated patients and in three (15%) of the 20 urokinase-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> complication rate for intraarterial fibrinolysis with tPA was very high in cases of basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at the doses we used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Protocol adjustments should be considered </plain></SENT>
