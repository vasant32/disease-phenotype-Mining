<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Activated protein C resistance (APCR) is the most common hereditary condition of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>And it is significantly linked to a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coagulation factor V gene that results in the mutations at R506, R306 and HR2 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the prevalence of APCR and its association with the factor V gene SNPs in Chinese Han thrombotic patients, we investigated a total of 346 Chinese thrombotic patients and 140 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls for APCR using the APTT-based assays, according to manufacturer's instructions, APC ratio &lt;/=2 indicated APC resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations of factor V at R506, R306, HR2 allele were detected by PCRMnl/I, Bst/NI, Rsa/I digestion as described before respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the incidence of APC resistance were 12.0% (12 of 100 cases) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> (ACT) patients (P &lt;0.05), 13.5% (13 of 96 cases) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) patients (P &lt;0.05), 16.7% (10 of 60 cases) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT) patients (P &lt;0.05), 15.6% (14 of 90 cases) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) patients (P &lt;0.05) and 5.0% (7 of 140 cases) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>APCR is associated with thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But no factor V R506Q mutation (FV Leiden) was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> patient and one DVT patient revealed heterozygous R306G mutation, which was confirmed by direct sequencing PCR products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, two SLE patients showed to be heterozygous HR2 allele for the first time in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that APC resistance in the Chinese Han population might not be associated with mutations of factor V at R506, R306 and HR2 polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Some other factors might contribute to APC resistance in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
