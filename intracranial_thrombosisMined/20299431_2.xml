<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as a distinct entity form a diverse collection of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> characterized by organized intraluminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and solid mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment options are <z:chebi fb="11" ids="53703">PVO</z:chebi> or selective coil occlusion of the remaining lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present long-term clinical and angiographic results of endovascular treatment of unruptured partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that presented with symptoms of mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1994 and 2008, 30 partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by selective coiling and 26 by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="53703">PVO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 53 (95%) were large or giant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic recovery during a mean clinical follow-up of 42.7 months was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size during a mean follow-up of 26.6 months in 46 patients was assessed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen of 56 patients (30%) fully recovered, 22 patients (39%) partially recovered, 11 patients (20%) were unchanged, and 6 patients (11%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery more often occurred after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="53703">PVO</z:chebi> than after coiling (12 of 26 versus 5 of 30, P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> size reduction occurred more often after <z:chebi fb="11" ids="53703">PVO</z:chebi> (17 of 18 versus 2 of 28, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> continued to grow after coiling, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 27 additional treatments were performed in 19 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated with coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with mass effect, the results of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="53703">PVO</z:chebi> are much better than those of selective coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After coiling, additional treatments are often needed, and some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> keep growing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="11" ids="53703">PVO</z:chebi> is not tolerated or not possible, surgical options should be considered before proceeding with coiling </plain></SENT>
