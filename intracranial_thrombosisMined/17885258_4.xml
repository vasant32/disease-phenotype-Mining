<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> prevents <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (AF); however, concerns regarding international normalized ratio control and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> limit its use in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) are potential alternatives to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, offering fixed dosing without drug and dietary interactions and the need for international normalized ratio monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although ximelagatran, a DTI studied in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prevention using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> trials, has been withdrawn, development of other DTIs continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in elderly high-risk AF patients on ximelagatran compared with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from patients with AF and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors randomized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Prevention using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial Fibrillation</z:hpo> III and V trials to ximelagatran or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> were analyzed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/systemic emboli, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and raised alanine aminotransferase levels in those &gt;or=75 (n=2804) and &lt;75 (n=4525) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ximelagatran was as effective as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/systemic emboli in the elderly (2.23%/y with ximelagatran vs 2.27%/y with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>) as in younger patients (1.25%/y vs 1.28%/y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total bleeds were significantly lower with ximelagatran compared with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in elderly (40% vs 45%, P=0.01) and younger (27% vs 35%, P&lt;0.001) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Raised alanine aminotransferase values (&gt;3-fold elevation) among ximelagatran patients were more common in older (7.5% old vs 5.3% young) patients, particularly women (9.5% elderly women vs 6.1% elderly men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk elderly AF patients, ximelagatran is as effective as <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> with less <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, but alanine aminotransferase elevations are common, particularly in elderly women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Oral DTIs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention show promise in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
