<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (PTIAs) are different from saccular or nonthrombosed giant or large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, as they are characterized by multiple intramural thrombotic phenomena related to recurrent vessel wall dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiological files of 23 consecutive patients with PTIAs (mean age 49.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two lesions were studied by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were managed by endovascular treatments, medically with steroids, or conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients presented with progressive neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was suspected but not proven in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At MRI, 90.9% of PTIAs caused mass effect; perilesional T2 hypersignal compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was evident in 13.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal wall enhancement was detectable in 63.2% of the PTIAs and considered a marker of inflammatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in seven patients with clinical improvement in six </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selective coiling was proposed in three patients (one improved, one remained stable, and one experienced symptoms progression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients were treated with steroids and improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were managed conservatively: eight because spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the lesion had been diagnosed and two because of clinical and radiological stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of PTIAs is different from other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They most commonly present with progressive neurological symptoms due to mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MRI properly diagnoses PTIAs and allows precise follow-up, more accurately than angiography because it detects prominent "abluminal" features indicating <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is part of the natural history of PTIAs and it should be taken in consideration when discussing the therapeutic management </plain></SENT>
