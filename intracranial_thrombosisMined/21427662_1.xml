<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of cases of CVT treated at Ibn Sina Hospital, Kuwait, from January 2000 to October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of 71 patients were retrieved and entered in a database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were evaluated with hypercoagulable work up and relevant neuro-imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one patients were included in our study, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentations were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (93%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (31%), and focal neurological signs (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over two-thirds (n=30) of female patients had a history of oral contraceptive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>Papilledema</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> was recorded in 20 patients (28%), ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome with CVT in one patient, and possible Neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004943" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Behcet</z:e>`s in 10% (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The venous sinuses involved were superior sagittal sinus in 59% (n=42), and transverse and straight sinuses in 54% (n=38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic venous infarctions were seen in 18% (n=13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients recovered within 2-4 weeks, 15 patients (21%) recovered within 4-12 weeks, and 15 patients (21%) required intensive care unit care with ventilator support for 1-2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Oral contraceptive use was the primary risk factor in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and immediate treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> reduce the morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Serum D-dimer level is more helpful for early diagnosis with sensitivity of 58% </plain></SENT>
