<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several case reports have linked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, yet, it is unclear whether this is a chance association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a case-control design data of whole blood count and screening for thrombophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> of 121 prospectively identified patients with CVT and 120 healthy controls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was defined as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) concentration of &lt;120 g/l in females, and &lt;130 g/l in males, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> as a Hb &lt;90 g/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated based on a logistic regression model treating variables with a level of significance of p &lt; or = 0.2 on univariate analysis as potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Thrombophilia</z:hpo> (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.76, p &lt; 0.01), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-2.22, p &lt; 0.05), and hypercholesterinemia (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-2.57, p &lt; 0.05) were the only independent variables associated with CVT on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is significantly and independently associated with CVT </plain></SENT>
