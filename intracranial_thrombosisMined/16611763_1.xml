<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> distal to an occluded cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) presents a challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our results of endovascular therapy in 7 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUES: Among patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at our institution from June 2001 to June 2005, we retrospectively identified 7 patients who underwent endovascular therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The techniques used for vessel recanalization were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postprocedure CT scans were reviewed for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes were assessed by using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) with good outcomes assigned scores of &lt; or =2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 patients revealed cervical ICA occlusion, with additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intracranial thrombus</z:e> in 6 of the 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, a guiding catheter was placed in the ipsilateral common carotid artery proximal to the occlusion and a microcatheter advanced through the ICA clot to deliver intra-arterial (IA) tissue plasminogen activator (in 6 patients, the microcatheter was also advanced intracranially for thrombolysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization of the occluded ICA was achieved in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, balloon angioplasty and stent placement of the cervical ICA was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CT in 6 patients showed small basal ganglia <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 4, patchy parietal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in one, and frontal lobe <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 1 month after the procedure, 5 patients had good clinical outcomes (mRS of 0 in 4 patients and 1 in one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Performance of IA thrombolysis by passing a microcatheter through an acutely occluded internal carotid artery may be an effective therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
