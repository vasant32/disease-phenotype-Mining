<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over an eight year period, 4 out of 123 CAPD patients (3%) were identified as having Hct values exceeding 50% for 1 month or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 4 patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IDD|jodm|iddm">insulin dependent diabetics</z:e> (4/47 diabetic patients, 8.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed on 3 of these 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>Polycythemia</z:hpo> developed after a mean of 21 +/- 7 months on peritoneal dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo>, ferritin levels were low and ferrous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> therapy was begun at a time the Hct values were 36 to 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin levels were obtained in 2 patients, and were 22 U/L (Hct 51%) and less than 5 U/L (Hct 55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Renal ultrasound failed to show renal masses or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had a plasma volume of 2.1 L (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 2.4-3.2 L); another patient was clinically volume depleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications during the period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gangrenous</z:e> feet requiring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> in 2 patients, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> in 2 patients, and splenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> is uncommon in CAPD patients and occurs most often in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Volume <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and iron therapy may play a role in its etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this high risk group of patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> may contribute to vascular complications and should be avoided </plain></SENT>
