<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association between apoE genotypes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes by a case-control study in Bangladesh for the first time among south Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First-ever-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (n=227; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, n=147, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, n=80) and 190 controls were recruited from a hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was based on CT and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was classified anatomically into cortical and penetrating region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infarction in the cortical region was further categorized etiologically into <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was considered as a whole in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotypes were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders both the epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype and epsilon4 carrier conferred an approximately 3-fold increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in the cortical artery region (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 10.4 and OR 3.1, 95% Cl 1.1 to 9.0, respectively) compared with epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, when the analysis was restricted to the elderly (&gt;60 years), epsilon 2 carrier was associated with a risk of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 19.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 295.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study suggested that both apoE epsilon3/epsilon4 genotype and epsilon4 carriers were risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in cortical artery region, whereas epsilon 2 carrier was a risk factor for hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
