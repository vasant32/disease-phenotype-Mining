<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Computed tomographic scans of 17 adult patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhages</z:mp> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraventricular clot volume was determined and analyzed over time to determine both a standardized percentage rate and an absolute rate of clot resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results were analyzed by use of regression for cross sectional time-series data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the kinetics of intraventricular clot resolution, the effect of the clot volume on the percentage rate of clot resolution, clot half-life, and absolute rate of clot resolution was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The potential effect of age, sex, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and treatment with external ventricular drainage on the percentage rate of clot resolution was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage rate of clot resolution was 10.8% per day (95% confidence interval, 9.05-12.61 %), and it was independent of initial clot volume, age, sex, type of underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and use of external ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absolute rate of clot resolution varied directly with the maximal clot volume (R2 = 0.88; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage clot resolution data are consistent with events during the first 24 to 48 hours that antagonize clot resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that intraventricular blood clot resolution in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> follows first-order kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The thrombolytic enzyme system responsible for intraventricular clot resolution seems to be saturated at 24 to 48 hours after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
