<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The paper considers surgical treatment of patients with partially thrombotic giant and fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), which is a challenge of cerebrovascular neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Giant, fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are clinically manifested themselves as a mass effect in 80% of cases and as spontaneous subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to their vicinity of the brain stem, giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in any clinical course present a real threat to a patient's life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A case of clipping of partially thrombotic giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> by means of tunnel clips to form the wall of a vessel from an apron cut from the aneurysmal wall is considered in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment of partially thrombotic giant and fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is identified as an individual problem of cerebrovascular neurosurgery, which awaits a sophisticated study in order to define an adequate surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
