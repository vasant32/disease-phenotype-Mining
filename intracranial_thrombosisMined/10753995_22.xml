<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be divided into 2 clinically different subtypes: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> fusiform or dolichoectatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 2, the natural history and growth mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A consecutive series of 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was studied retrospectively to clarify patient clinical and neuroradiological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> tissues were obtained from 8 cases and were examined to identify histological features that could correspond to the radiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four histological features were found: (1) fragmentation of internal elastic lamina (IEL), (2) neoangiogenesis within the thickened intima, (3) intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IMH) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation, and (4) repetitive intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> from the newly formed vessels within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IEL fragmentation was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, which suggests that this change may be one of the earliest processes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI or CT detected IMH, and marked contrast enhancement of the inside of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall (CEI) on MRI corresponded well with intimal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of 9 symptomatic cases but none of 7 asymptomatic cases presented with both radiological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are progressive lesions that start with IEL fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Formation of IMH seems to be a critical event necessary for lesions to become symptomatic and progress, and this can be monitored on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of this possible mechanism of progression and corresponding MRI characteristics could help determine timing of surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
