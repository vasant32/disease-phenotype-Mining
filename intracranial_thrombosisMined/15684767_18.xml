<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sought to investigate the temporal and spatial profiles of intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and to evaluate the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>, a beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme-A</z:chebi> (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Young male Wistar rats weighing 350-400 g were subjected to controlled cortical impact injury, and were sacrificed at 1 and 4 h, and 1, 3, 8, and 15 days after TBI (5 rats/time point), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the evaluation of the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> on intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, rats were subjected to TBI, and subsequently <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg) was orally administered starting 1 day after TBI and then daily until sacrifice at 3, 8, and 15 days after TBI (5 rats/time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before sacrifice of animals, blood was withdrawn and employed for the measurement of von Willibrand factor and platelet activity using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain tissues were prepared for histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data show that (1) delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is present in the lesion boundary zone and in the hippocampal CA3 region, starting at 1-4 h, peaking at 1-3 days, and then declining at 8 and 15 days after TBI; (2) intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> also occurs in the other areas of cortex, striatum, and corpus callosum, but with a scattered distribution; (3) delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> are composed of platelets, fibrin, and vWF; and (4) reduction of the plasma vWF level and platelet activity by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> decreases delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> reduces intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> attributed to hemostatic disturbances caused by TBI </plain></SENT>
