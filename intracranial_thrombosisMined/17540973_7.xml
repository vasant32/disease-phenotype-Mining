<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although intravenous (IV) thrombolysis is the standard treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurring within 3 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, a few interventional neuroradiologists have been treating this category of patients by an intra-arterial (IA) route for &gt;25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, evidence is still required to support the clinical feeling that IA treatment, which needs longer time and greater complexity, leads to a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective of the present review was to analyze beliefs and myths underlying the selection of patients for IA thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified and debunked the following myths on IA thrombolysis: (1) IA thrombolysis works better than IV because it achieves higher recanalization rates; (2) IA thrombolysis works better than IV after the 3-hour window; (3) IA thrombolysis works better than IV in vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; (4) carotid duplex, transcranial doppler, CT angiography, or MRA should be used to screen for major vessel occlusion treatable with IA thrombolysis; (5) to be treated with IA thrombolysis, patients should be selected with diffusion/perfusion MRI; (6) IA thrombolysis should be used as a "rescue" therapy for IV thrombolysis; and (7) the efficacy of IA thrombolysis depends on the thrombolytic agent or the device used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> management with IA thrombolysis is scant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, neither clinicians nor patients have enough information to make truly informed decisions about the most appropriate treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only randomized controlled trials can clear uncertainties about the possible superiority of IA over IV thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regretfully, case series on IA treatment have limited the organization of such trials and have only favored the spread of myths </plain></SENT>
