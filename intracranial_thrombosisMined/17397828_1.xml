<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a small molecule that shows high oxygen-delivery capacity, and exhibits extended plasma half-life compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> alone, thus reducing renal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to evaluate potential neuroprotective effects of SB1 using a rat middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery of male Sprague-Dawley rats was occluded with a thrombotic blood clot and SB1 was administered via intra-arterial infusion 5 min after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain tissue was harvested after 2 h, and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were calculated from coronal sections stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three to 6 days after the procedure, sub-groups of animals were subjected to an open field test and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> to assess locomotor activity and learning/memory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic blood clots induced extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>; however, these were significantly reduced in SB1 treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, SB1 treatment <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>increased locomotor activity</z:mp> in open field tests, and improved the learning/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SB1 has neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain injury caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
