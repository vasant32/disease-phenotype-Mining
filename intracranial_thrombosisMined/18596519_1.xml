<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the technical feasibility of using a retrievable, closed cell intracranial stent delivered through a microcatheter for safe removal of foreign bodies or clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro and in vivo testing were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of using retrievable intracranial stents for foreign body or clot removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro testing was performed in an anatomically correct <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> vascular replica by partially deploying the stent around a coil, then retracting the stent into the microcatheter to trap the coil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Withdrawal of the stent delivery system into the guide catheter resulted in coil removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the technique was evaluated in a porcine model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, wherein both fresh clot and herniated coils were extracted from the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In these experimental procedures, both herniated coils and fresh clot were safely and easily removed from the in vitro and in vivo models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No periprocedural adverse events were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These in vitro and in vivo studies suggest the potential use of retrievable stents for the removal of foreign bodies or clot from the intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
