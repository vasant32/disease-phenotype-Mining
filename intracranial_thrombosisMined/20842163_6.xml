<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, surrounding arterioles and capillary beds remain flowing and might provide collateral flow around the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used femtosecond laser ablation to trigger clotting in single penetrating arterioles in rat cortex and two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy to measure changes in microvessel diameter and red blood cell speed after the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that after occlusion of a single penetrating arteriole, nearby penetrating and surface arterioles did not dilate, suggesting that alternate blood flow routes are not actively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, capillaries showed two types of reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capillaries directly downstream from the occluded arteriole dilated after the clot, but other capillaries in the same vicinity did not dilate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in capillary response suggests that signals for vasodilation are vascular rather than parenchymal in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although both neighboring arterioles and capillaries dilated in response to topically applied <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> after the occlusion, the flow in the territory of the occluded arteriole did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow from neighboring penetrating arterioles is neither actively recruited nor effective in improving blood flow after the occlusion of a single penetrating arteriole </plain></SENT>
