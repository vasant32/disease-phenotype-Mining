<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients of "emergent" admission (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> n = 8, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> n = 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> n = 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> n = 6, essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> n = 3), 3 bouts of blood pressure measurement at intervals of 10-15 min during the control period were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In case of systolic blood pressure higher than 200 mmHg, at least one time, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> at a dose of 10 mg was sublingually administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded at intervals of 15 min up to the end of the first one hour, then at intervals of 30 min up to the end of 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In terms of the average values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, blood pressure fell to near lowest levels by the end of about 30 min after the administration and it stayed at near lowest levels up to the end of 120-240 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During this period of time, pulse rate remained substantially unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of the pattern of the blood pressure fall, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases could be classified generally into two types, namely (a) the "dip" group (7 cases) in which blood pressure fell to the lowest level to form a "dip" and remained below the control level, although it showed a trend to return to control level for 4 h and (b) the "flat" group (15 cases) in which blood pressure declined gradually for about 1 h and, then, remained low or below the control level, although it showed a trend to return to control level throughout the rest of the observation period of 4 h </plain></SENT>
