<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report was to analyze changes in the donor population and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis of donor records between 1977 and 2005, included 1331 donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since 1977, the number of donors has remained unchanged, but their profile has changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median donor age today has almost doubled, from 30 to nearly 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early on the most common cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was head trauma and the majority of donors were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the mid-1980s, the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and the gender distribution became equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of procured and transplanted organs from each donor has increased, despite an increased donor age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multi-organ donor rate exceeded 80% in the beginning of this decade; we retrieved 3.9 organs per donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results may be explained by improved organ donor care and organization, and by increased awareness of potential donors among elderly patients </plain></SENT>
