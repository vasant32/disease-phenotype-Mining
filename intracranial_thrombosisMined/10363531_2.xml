<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the relationship between long-term prognosis of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and their MRI findings, 103 patients with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, who survived more than three months after the ictus, were studied for five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean age of 98 patients (T group), who were followed up completely, was 73.1 years-old and 65 were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age-matched controls consisted of two groups: 65 subjects, who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (R group), and 85 subjects, who had any <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (N group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI findings were divided into six categories: 1) types of causative lesion, 2) grades of periventricular hyperintensity (none, rims/caps, patchy, diffuse PVH), 3) number of spotty lesions, 4) presence of silent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo>, and 6) extents of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Types of causative lesion were subdivided into 3 subtypes; infarction of the perforating artery territory (P type), infarction of the cortical artery territory (C type), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> (B type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of vascular risks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and the extent of activity of daily living (ADL) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The P, C, and B types were identified by MRI in 46, 36, and 16 of the T group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Motor impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and an ADL status of complete dependence at discharge were also seen in 84, 44, and 22, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the T group, 33 patients died during five years, which resulted in a cumulative mortality rate of 33.7% and an annual mortality rate of 8.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on log-rank analysis, the survival rate of the T group revealed was significantly lower than those of the R and N groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recurrent rate in the T group (annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was 4.0%) was higher than in the R and N groups, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence was not the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and two thirds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> and/or asphyxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cox hazard regression analysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> showed that the hazard ratios of infarction, patchy PVH, and more than 4 spotty lesions were 8.87 (p &lt; .001), 0.31 (p = .058), and 0.44 (p = .098), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared to the survival group, rates of complete dependence in ADL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> were significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> group with low incidences of the P type and patchy PVH, which indicated small vessel disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, even in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, care should be taken to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and/or asphyxia due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no MRI findings were distinct predictors of long-term prognosis, although infarction based on the small vessel disease had rather good outcome in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
