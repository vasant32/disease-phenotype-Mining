<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current study was designed to examine the hypothesis that astaxanthin, a red pigment <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoid</z:chebi> found in salmonid and crustacean aquaculture, protects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) from vascular oxidative damage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male 6-week-old SHRSP were classified into 4 groups: a control group, 2 astaxanthin groups, and a vitamin E group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treated animals were given either astaxanthin or vitamin E for 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body weights in each group were not significantly different from control group during the treatment period, but the usual increase in systolic blood pressure in SHRSP observed with age was significantly suppressed by treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombogenesis, assessed using a <z:chebi fb="64" ids="30217">helium</z:chebi>-neon (He-Ne) laser technique in pial blood vessels, together with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> activity, assessed by measuring urinary 8-OHdG levels, were significantly moderated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) metabolites were increased after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results supported our hypothesis and strongly suggested that the antithrombotic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> effects of astaxanthin or vitamin E may be related to an increase in bioavailable NO, possibly mediated by decreased inactivation of NO by reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
