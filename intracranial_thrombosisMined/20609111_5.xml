<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Previous neuropathological studies documented that small vascular and microvascular pathology is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More recently, we showed that thalamic and basal ganglia lacunes are associated with post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and may affect emotional regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examines whether this is also the case for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a detailed analysis of small macrovascular and microvascular pathology in the post mortem brains of 38 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (LOD) and 29 healthy elderly controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A clinical diagnosis of LOD was established while the subjects were alive using the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-IV criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> charts for the presence of clinical criteria of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological evaluation included bilateral semi-quantitative assessment of lacunes, deep white matter and periventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, cortical microinfarcts and both focal and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between vascular burden and LOD was investigated using Fisher's exact test and univariate and multivariate logistic regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither the existence of lacunes nor the presence of microvascular ischaemic lesions was related to occurrence of LOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there was no relationship between vascular lesion scores and LOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This was also the case within the subgroup of LOD patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results challenge the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> hypothesis by showing that neither deep white matter nor periventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> is associated with LOD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with our previous observations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, they also imply that the impact of lacunes on mood may be significant solely in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain compromise </plain></SENT>
