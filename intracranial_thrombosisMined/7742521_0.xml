<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In summary, our 31-year-old patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000044'>hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism</z:hpo> has <z:hpo ids='HP_0005897'>severe osteoporosis</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her GnRH deficiency can be overcome using ovulation induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, if she becomes pregnant there is a small risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo> because of her previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This risk is hard to quantify but would undoubtedly increase if her mobility were impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The metabolic and mechanical alterations of pregnancy may compromise her weakened skeleton and increase the risk of a second major fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her skeletal status precludes the use of standard <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fractionated low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi> would be the prophylactic agent of choice, possibly switching to low-dose <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> for the second trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alternative prophylaxis using low-dose aspirin may be suitable, although this is not proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difficulty in this case is that pregnancy and the prophylactic measures designed to protect the patient may prove to be detrimental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The case also highlights the vital role of prepregnancy counselling and interdisciplinary consultation between obstetrician, haematologist and endocrinologist in order to steer the safest course through this therapeutic minefield </plain></SENT>
