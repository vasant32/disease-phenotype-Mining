<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is predominantly observed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that are large and have relatively narrow necks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a case of a 48-year-old woman presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) due to rupture of a 2-mm <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anterior cerebral artery treated by microsurgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six months after treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, the patient presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SAH was excluded, but computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed the recurrence of a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (7 mm) that was confirmed by cerebral angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatment was scheduled for several days later, but DSA also revealed spontaneous occlusion of the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the control CTA performed one week later, the recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had again reappeared, again confirmed by DSA, and was subsequently treated by coil embolization </plain></SENT>
