<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the variants of the PDE4D (phosphodiesterase 4D) gene are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially with the combination of cardio-embolic and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the Icelandic population, but it is still very controversial as to whether PDE4D is a susceptible gene for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in other populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested whether the PDE4D gene variation also confers <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was tested in a case-control study of a Chinese population comprising 639 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (including 253 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 171 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and 215 with intracerebral haemorrhage) and 887 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) (rs966221, rs456009 and rs2910829) in PDE4D were chosen based on the significant association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> reported previously in a Western population, and these were genotyped using PCR/RFLP (restriction-fragment-length polymorphism) and confirmed by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that only SNP83 (rs966221) was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele C of rs966221 is a risk allele, conferring an increased risk for atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> [OR (odds ratio), 1.51; 95% CI (confidence interval), 1.09-2.10] independent of conventional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis confirmed that haplotype G-C-C was associated with increased risk for atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.300-2.491) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings support that SNP83 of PDE4D is a genetic risk factor for atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
