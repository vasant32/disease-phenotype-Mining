<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> usually has a very poor outcome and is associated with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Local intra-arterial thrombolysis may improve the clinical outcome and reduce mortality in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the possible variables affecting recanalization and clinical outcome in patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> undergoing thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the clinical course and outcome of a series of 26 patients between 1998 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who were examined within 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms underwent emergency cerebral angiography and subsequent intra-arterial thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients additionally received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of underlying stenosis at the site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Outcome was good in 9 patients (34.6%) and poor in 17 (65.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization could be achieved in 24 patients (92.3%) and was not affected by age, sex, site of occlusion, etiology, thrombolytic drugs, or time interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was associated with younger age, good initial clinical condition, and no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the interval (greater or less than 6 hours) from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms until the end of thrombolysis and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that intra-arterial thrombolysis reduces mortality in basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Young patients (&lt;75 years) without any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in brain stem before the start of treatment seem to be the ideal candidates for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> could and should be reopened, even late (after 6 hours) after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
