<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety children were included in the study: 30 children (4-15 years) after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> of an unknown etiology; 30 migrainous patients (8-15 years), who were hospitalized in the Department of Developmental Neurology, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland, and 30 healthy children of the same age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The statistical analysis showed an increase in the values of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti beta2-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> 1 (beta2-GP1) and Thm in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resultant values were higher, but stayed at standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The possible role of prothrombotic factors in individual cases of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
