<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are known to be vulnerable to recanalization after coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, concerns about the extent or age of intra-aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> have not been addressed in relation to the recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the follow-up results in ten patients with largely thrombosed (&gt;or=80% in volume) saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of ten patients with largely thrombosed saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by coil embolization were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> size measured on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>/CT images and angiograms was 25.6 +/- 8.1 and 8.7 +/- 2.9 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were ruptured, and four were symptomatic due to mass effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographic occlusion rates after coiling were total occlusion in two, neck remnant in seven, and residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up anatomical and clinical outcomes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No permanent complication developed after procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recanalization occurred in three (30%) during a mean follow-up period of 17.4 +/- 16.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck size (P = 0.03) was found to be significantly associated with recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with recanalization underwent repeat embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The symptoms related to mass effects were improved in three (75%) after coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After treatment, a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode did not occur in any of ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a series of ten patients with largely thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, this study showed that endovascular treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was a safe procedure with a 30% rate of midterm recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results will provide preliminary information and a meaningful basis for further study on treatment outcomes of this specific subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
