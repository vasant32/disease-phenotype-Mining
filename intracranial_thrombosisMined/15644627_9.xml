<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing early hospital admission have been described for several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types but not for cerebral vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CVT is more difficult to diagnose than arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; delay in hospital admission may postpone CVT treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were: (1) to describe the delay between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and hospital admission of patients with CVT, and (2) to identify the variables that influence that delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We registered the interval (days) between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and hospital admission in 91 consecutive patients admitted to 20 Portuguese hospitals between June 1995 and June 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also studied the impact of admission delay on treatments (prescription of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and the number of days elapsed between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and start of anticoagulation and admission) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median admission delay was 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (25%) patients were admitted within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of the patients were admitted within 7 days and 75% within 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analysis, admission within 24 h was positively associated with mental status disorder (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919974" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">abulia</z:e>; OR = 4.59; 95% CI = 1.41-14.89) and negatively associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (OR = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.00-0.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presentation as isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with admission delay of more than 4 days (OR = 2.63; 95% CI = 0.97-7.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Papilloedema</z:e> was associated with an admission delay of more than 13 days (OR = 4.69; 95% CI = 1.61-13.61) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no association between admission delay and the proportion of anticoagulated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and start of anticoagulation was shorter in patients admitted earlier (p = 0.0001, for either admission within 24 h, 4 or 13 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is a considerable delay until the clinical picture associated with CVT is recognised as justifying hospital admission, especially when patients present with symptoms identical to isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
