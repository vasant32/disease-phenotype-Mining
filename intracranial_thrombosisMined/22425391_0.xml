<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation of cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CSVT) is recommended in adults and has been also approved in the paediatric setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some controversies remain however between the existing paediatric professional consensus, notably about its use in children with intra-cranial haemorrhage and in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The publication of further original studies prompted the French Society for Paediatric Neurology (SFNP) in association with a panel of EPNS experts, to update the level of evidence and the knowledge in this domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A bibliographic analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> are widely used in paediatrics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is well tolerated by children (Class I, level of evidence B) and also probably by neonates (Class IIa, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, anticoagulation is probably effective in reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and sequelae in children (Class IIa, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is not yet possible to draw any conclusions regarding neonates (Class IIb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is also effective in reducing the risk of recurrence (Class I, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This risk is dependent on several individual factors such as the age of the child, the cause of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the persistence or the recurrence of thrombogenic factors, and the speed of sinus recanalisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of anticoagulation needs therefore to be individually tailored (Class I, level of evidence B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations have led to the following recommendations: -In the absence of any contraindication, it is reasonable to initiate anticoagulation during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CSVT in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prolonged treatment over 3-6 months is justified according to individual factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>-In the absence of any contraindication, anticoagulation may be considered individually during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of CSVT in neonates for a duration of 6-12 weeks </plain></SENT>
