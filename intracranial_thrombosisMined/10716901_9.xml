<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A cortical venous infarction model has been evaluated as to the degree of regional flow reduction and by studying effects of cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two adjacent cortical veins were occluded photochemically with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and fiberoptic illumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven rats served to demonstrate effects on regional cortical blood flow using laser Doppler scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 36 rats local CBF, DC potential, and brain tissue impedance were measured continuously for 75 min after vein occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No, 3, or 10 CSD waves were induced by <z:chebi fb="11" ids="32588">potassium chloride</z:chebi> injection during the initial 75 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were compared for spontaneous CSDs; baseline local CBF, CBF, and impedance response to CSD; and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-five minutes after vein occlusion regional cortical flow in a 3.5x7-mm window was reduced to 34.3+/-13.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 45% of the 840 measured locations in 7 rats flow was &lt;40% baseline and at 27.3% &lt;30%, indicating a widespread penumbra territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the initial 75 min 2.1+/-1.1 spontaneous CSDs were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between the number of spontaneous CSDs seen acutely and infarction volume after 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, brain injury was significantly increased in the group with 10 KCl-induced CSDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A reduced 1CBF response and an overshooting tissue impedance change during CSD were predictors of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates a CSD-related growth of the venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Second, the data indicate that flow after two-vein occlusion resembles that seen under penumbra conditions, allowing for studies of damage mechanisms responsible for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
