<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report an independent 88-year-old female, on aspirin only for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, who presented with a 12-hour history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lumbar <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo> and progressive bilateral lower limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
