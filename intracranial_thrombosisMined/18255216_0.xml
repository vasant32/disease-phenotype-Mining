<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the scope of therapeutic ultrasound applications in the adult brain, such as sonothrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, a better understanding of the intracranial acoustic properties during insonation through the temporal bone is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Innovative ultrasound imaging techniques, like transcranial duplex sonography, may open new avenues to apply ultrasound for therapeutic purposes and to visually monitor the effect using the same device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study the transcranial sound field aberrations and the changes of acoustic parameters, using a high-end duplex machine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six cadaver skulls were insonated through the temporal bone window, using a diagnostic duplex ultrasound device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measurements were done in a water tank, using a needle hydrophone to assess and compute acoustic parameters, such as peak intensity, peak-to-peak, peak-positive, peak-negative acoustic pressure, beam area etc. in a 2-D plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It could be shown that the absorption and wavefront distortion effects of the temporal bone are variable among different skulls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of signal absorption of the bone, the mechanical index of the incident ultrasound wave drops by a factor &gt; or =10 in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the beam area might be increased by a factor of almost 4, because of phase aberration (i.e., defocusing) </plain></SENT>
