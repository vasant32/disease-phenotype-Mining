<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Flow diverters (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FDs</z:e>) are increasingly used to treat complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, but preclinical studies that could guide clinical applications are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors designed a modular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model in canines to address this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three variants of one modular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model were constructed in 21 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sidewall (n=5), curved sidewall (n=5), and end-wall bifurcation (n=7) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with prototype 36-wire <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four more end-wall bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with prototype 48-wire lower-porosity <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic results postimplantation and at 3 months were scored with an ordinal scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were euthanized at 3 (n=17) or 6 (n=3) months, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> covering the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ostium was photographed to analyze metallic porosity and amount of neointima formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Straight sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were better occluded than curved sidewall and end-wall bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at the 3-month angiography follow-up (p=0.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Flow diverters failed to occlude curved sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n=0/5) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one (n=1/7) end-wall bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographic results were no better (n=0/4) using a 48-wire <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> (p=0.788) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Branches jailed by the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> (n=16) remained patent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metallic porosity was decreased (p=0.014) and neointimal closure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> ostium was more complete (p=0.040) in sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> than in curved or bifurcation variants of the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flow diverters may succeed in treating straight sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, but the same device repeatedly fails to occlude curved sidewall and end-wall bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In vivo studies can be designed to test basic principles that, once validated, may serve to guide clinical use of new devices </plain></SENT>
