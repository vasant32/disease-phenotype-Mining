<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many acquired and inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> states (HS) have been described as cause of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: [corrected] We evaluated the incidence of acquired and inherited thrombophilic risk factors in a population of CVT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>Hypercoagulability</z:hpo> studies were to carried out for patients suffering from radiologically confirmed CVT during a 3 year period (1998-2000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prothrombin time, aPTT, protein C, protein S and antithrombin III activities, screening and confirmatory tests for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), and activated protein C resistance (APCR) were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic tests for G1691A factor V (Factor V Leiden), G20210A prothrombin and C677T methylentetrahidrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computer database was used for descriptive statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 16 patients with CVT (M/F, 6/10) were screened for inherited and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398622" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired coagulation disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age of 23.66 years with standard desviation of 19.74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two older patients had antecedents of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> in leg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found 1 heterocygosis factor V Leiden associated to LA, 2 heterocygosis G20210A prothrombin (one associated to LA), 2 homocygosis C677T MTHFR, 1 hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001976'>antithrombin III deficiency</z:hpo> and 4 LA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>COMMENTS: Although this is a small series, we found a high incidence of hereditary (37.5%) and acquired (37.5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> in patients with CVT </plain></SENT>
