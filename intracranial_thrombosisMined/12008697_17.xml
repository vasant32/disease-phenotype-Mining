<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) may occur after the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study is to investigate possible risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and to determine their frequency and time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 178 consecutive patients with 193 treated intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 159 GDC procedures were performed to treat 143 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 133 of those patients who were in good neurological condition, allowing clinical detection of postprocedure ischemic events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association of clinical, anatomical, and pharmacological factors with intraprocedure intraarterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> and with postprocedure ischemic events was investigated by using uni- and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> protruding into the parent artery was noted during six of 159 GDC procedures, resulting in a clinical deficit in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No factor was associated with intraprocedure intraarterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten postprocedure ischemic events occurred in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven events occurred within 24 hours, and three events occurred between 24 hours and 58 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysm</z:hpo> diameter and protruding coils were significant independent predictors of postprocedure ischemic events in multivariate analysis (both p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 3.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> diameter and protruding loops of coils are associated with postprocedure ischemic events after GDC placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that GDC-treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> retain thromboembolic potential beyond 2 months </plain></SENT>
