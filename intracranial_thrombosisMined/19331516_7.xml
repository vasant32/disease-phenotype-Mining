<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed at 2 days for calculating microclot burden (n=13) and IgG staining area (n=13) in the brain sections as indicators of post-traumatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) breakdown, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another set of injured animals treated in the same way were sacrificed at 7 days to compare cortical lesion volumes (n=28) and CA3 hippocampal cell loss (n=24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluations were done blinded with respect to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found with respect to microclot burden or IgG staining volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injection of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> tPA caused significantly ( p&lt;0.05) larger cortical injuries and greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was significantly less cortical injury ( p&lt;0.01) and hippocampal cell loss ( p&lt;0.01) in the RBC=tPA group than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that RBC/tPA is more neuroprotective in experimental TBI than is unbound tPA </plain></SENT>
