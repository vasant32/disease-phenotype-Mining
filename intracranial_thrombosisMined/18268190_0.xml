<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Pregnant patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transient focal neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Women with histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo>, or cerebrovascular disease were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, gradient-recalled echo imaging, and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and angiography to determine the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent echocardiography, duplex ultrasonography, and a battery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> tests and were followed up a mean of 12 months after the event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight controls and 14 patients were enrolled from 23 773 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 31.2 (range, 24-41) years and mean gestational age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 28 (range, 17-44) weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No controls reported transient focal neurologic symptoms, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> aura, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> (6 patients) and hemisensory (5) and hemimotor (7) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, these symptoms were preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0010822'>scintillating scotoma</z:hpo>; in 9 patients, focal symptoms were followed by a first-ever, throbbing, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient had evidence of frank infarction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 2 patients had single, small, hyperintense bright foci on FLAIR imaging without accompanying lesions on DWI, and 11 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI and MRV results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Echocardiography, carotid duplex ultrasonography, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> results were negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had ischemic events and 4 (29%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002077'>migraines with aura</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Focal neurologic symptoms in healthy pregnant women are frequently preceded by aural visual phenomena and can usually be attributed to a first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is less common than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo> and can be reliably diagnosed with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Extensive evaluations to assess a putative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> and cardiocerebrovascular pathology may not be warranted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> such patients </plain></SENT>
