<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, whether spontaneous or traumatic (tICH), often expand, and an association has been described between <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> expansion and worse clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is a hemostatic agent that has been shown to limit <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> expansion and which, therefore, could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality in tICH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This first prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety and preliminary effectiveness of rFVIIa to limit tICH progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were enrolled if they had tICH lesions of at least 2 ml on a baseline computed tomographic scan obtained within 6 hours of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rFVIIa or placebo was administered within 2.5 hours of the baseline computed tomographic scan but no later than 7 hours after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic scans were repeated at 24 and 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five escalating dose tiers were evaluated (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 microg/kg rFVIIa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical evaluations and adverse events were recorded until Day 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences were detected in mortality rate or number and type of adverse events among treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, detected on routinely performed ultrasound at Day 3, was observed more frequently in the combined rFVIIa treatment group (placebo, 3%; rFVIIa, 8%; not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A nonsignificant trend for rFVIIa dose-response to limit tICH volume increase was observed (placebo, 21.0 ml; rFVIIa, 10.1 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this first prospective study of rFVIIa in tICH, there appeared to be less <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> progression in rFVIIa-treated patients (80-200 microg/kg) compared with that seen in placebo treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The potential significance of this biological effect on clinical outcomes and the significance of the somewhat higher incidence of ultrasound-detected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149871" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deep vein thromboses</z:e> in the rFVIIa-treated group need to be examined in a larger prospective randomized clinical trial </plain></SENT>
