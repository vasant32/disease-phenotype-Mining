<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is widely recognized that <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is the major event in the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But the contribution of coagulation factors to the development of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial diseases</z:e> is still not clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to establish the possible relationship between coagulation factors as well as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population consisted of 69 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and 71 with AIS as well as 50 age-matched healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the control group, plasma tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activities and both TF and TFPI antigens were significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> group; plasma TF activity and antigen in AIS group were significantly increased, but the activity and antigen of plasma TFPI were significantly decreased in the AIS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma FVII coagulation (FVII:C) activity was markedly higher in patients with AIS, but not statistically different to the control in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FVIII coagulation (FVIII:C) activity was remarkably higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> but slightly lower than the control in patients with AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and AIS groups, prothrombin activity and clottable fibrinogen were significantly higher and plasma antithrombin III activity was remarkably lower than the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> and AIS, the initiation of TF pathway would be associated with the thrombotic events and that the blood be in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But the changes of FVII:C, TFPI and FVIII:C in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMI</z:e> are different from those in AIS </plain></SENT>
