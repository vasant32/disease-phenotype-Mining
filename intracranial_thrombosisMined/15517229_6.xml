<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in 47 patients: (1) internal carotid artery (ICA) + M1 middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion (n=12); (2) M1 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n=19); (3) M2 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, distal branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusion (n=16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with ICA occlusion had significantly larger DWI, PWI and mismatch lesion volume on pretreatment MRI compared to patients with other sites of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and peak height were significantly higher in patients with ICA occlusion compared to patients with other sites of occlusion (P=0.03 and P=0.04, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Day 1 MRA showed recanalization in 28 patients (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of recanalization was significantly different depending on the site of occlusion: 33% in ICA + M1 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 63% in M1 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and 81% in either M2 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, distal branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or ACA occlusion (P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that CBF and peak height are the most relevant MRI parameters to assess the severity of hemodynamic impairment in regard to the site of occlusion </plain></SENT>
