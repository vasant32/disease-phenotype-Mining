<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the outcome in the majority of uncomplicated CVT cases is good, it may be fatal in more affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We provide long-term functional and quality of life (QOL) outcome data in the form of a retrospective analysis of 10 patients admitted to a neurological ICU with severe CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures used were the modified Rankin Scale, the 36-item Short Form Health Survey, and the Psychological General Well-Being index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 50% but 4 out 5 survivors had a good functional outcome with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> QOL despite a very severe clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding justifies extensive life-sustaining therapy as the prognosis even of severe cases may be good if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase is survived </plain></SENT>
