<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HIT) is a dangerous potential complication of this therapy, but it has rarely been reported in Ph-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of 29 patients with Ph-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> who have been treated with UFH or LMWH for unusual splanchnic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (3 cerebral sinus, 6 portal and 20 hepatic vein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of the study was to determine the occurrence of new thrombotic events during <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy secondary to HIT (HITT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy, 5 out of the 29 patients (17%) developed a new thrombotic episode (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>) with a high clinical probability of HIT based on the 4 T's score even though not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients developed 'true' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of HIT was established in 2 patients (6.8%) through the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-related antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ph-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> patients on <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> warrant careful monitoring and HIT has to be suspected whenever platelet counts drop or a new <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is detectable </plain></SENT>
