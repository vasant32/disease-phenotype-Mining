<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that platelets from the main constituent of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental work has shown that 5-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16765">tryptamine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi>) in a concentration of 0.06 mg/ml produces clumping of the platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In view of this it was decided to estimate platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> in thrombotic and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Estimations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> were made on washed platelets rather than platelet-rich plasma which has been used in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three groups were recognized on the basis of platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first group consisted of five subjects who were clinically asymptomatic at the time of investigation but died 24 to 48 hours later and were shown at autopsy to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>; they had the highest level of platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second group comprised eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> whose platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> ranged between 1529 and 2183 ng/10-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 22 subjects in the third group (11 apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and 11 with different pathologies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> ranged from 611 to 877 ng/10-9 and did not vary in the different pathological conditions studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since the highest level of platelet <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5 HT</z:chebi> was observed in patients prior to the formation or embolization of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, it is suggested that this may have some role in initiating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
