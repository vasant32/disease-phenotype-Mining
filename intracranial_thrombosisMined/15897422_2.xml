<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Resection of the internal jugular vein can be necessary in cases of radical neck dissection or even in cases involving benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_402'>glomus tumors</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the triad described by Virchow (ie, stasis of blood flow, damage to the endothelium, and changes in hemostasis), the development of a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the venous vessels superior to the resected internal jugular vein seems to be possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the extension of possible intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after wound healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A total of 17 patients requiring resection of the internal jugular vein were evaluated prospectively using magnetic resonance imaging and 2-dimensional (time-of-flight) magnetic resonance angiography after the surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative magnetic resonance images were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 patients for staging purposes as well as to exclude preoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp>, and 1 patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_402'>glomus tumor</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sigmoid sinus was found in 4 patients, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the transverse sinus was found in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> or signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> in any patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous vessels superior to the resected vein ranged from none to complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After unilateral resection of the internal jugular vein, the venous blood leaves the brain mainly via the venous network of the contralateral side of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the sigmoid or transverse sinus seems to occur more frequently than was previously thought, intracranial complications such as venous infarction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> appear to be very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After unilateral radical neck dissection, the venous blood leaves the brain mainly via the venous system of the other side of the neck and the ipsilateral collateral veins </plain></SENT>
