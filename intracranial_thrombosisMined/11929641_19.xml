<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 5-year case-control study including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Danish hospitals was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> women 15-44 years old suffering a first ever CTA during the period January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1998, were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were selected annually, 600 per year in 1994-1995, 1200 per year 1996-1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response rates for cases and controls were 88% and 90%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of nonvalid diagnoses, pregnant women, and women with previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic diseases</z:e>, 626 cases and 4054 controls were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate matched analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Controls were matched to cases within 1-year age bands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adjustments were made for the following potential confounders: year, length of OC use, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, family CTA, and years of schooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 212 and 1208 current users of OCs among cases and controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of CTA among current users of OCs decreased significantly with decreasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose (nonusers reference): OCs with 50 microg, 30-40 microg, 20 microg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyl estradiol</z:chebi> (EE) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestin</z:chebi>-only pills implied adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% CI) of 4.5 (2.6-7.7), 1.6 (1.3-2.0), 1.7 (1.0-3.1), and 1.0 (0.3-3.0), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Current users of OCs with second- (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6443">levonorgestrel</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50815">norgestimate</z:chebi>) and third- (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4453">desogestrel</z:chebi> or gestodene) generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> combined with 20-30 microg EE had ORs of CTA of 2.2 (1.6-3.0) and 1.4 (1.0-1.9), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After correction for differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose, the third- to second-generation risk ratio was 0.6 (0.4-0.9; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high dose OCs and OCs with second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> were associated with the risk of CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The risk increased 2.5 times with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> dose increasing from 20 to 50 microg EE, and users of low-dose OCs with second-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> had a 61% higher risk-association of CTA than users of OCs with third-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50745">progestins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
