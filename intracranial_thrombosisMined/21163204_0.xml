<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a multifactorial process with a wide clinical spectrum and many associated risk factors (RF) that could be complicated with venous infarction (VI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We study the influence of RF in the developing of venous infarction in patients with CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational study with consecutive inclusion of patients with CVT diagnosis admitted to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit of a Neurology Department between 1995 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RF were identified and their distribution according to the presence of VI was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were included (37 female; 71.15%) with mean age of 46.73 years (range 18-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent RF associated with CVT were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (26.92%) and oral contraceptives (OC) (25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and in 35.13% of females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent RF in patients with venous infarction was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (40.9%), whilst in the CVT group without venous infarction the use of oral contraceptives predominated (26.7% of the total sample; 38% of females), with thrombophilic states only being detected in 16.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cases of venous infarction were found in the group of patients with oral contraceptives but without an associated thrombophilic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There appears to be a different profile of associated RF in patients with venous infarction associated to CVT, with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> prevailing </plain></SENT>
