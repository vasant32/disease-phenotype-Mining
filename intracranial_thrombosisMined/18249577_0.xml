<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of basal cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is rupture of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo>, but most reported series of SAH include cases where no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This would have no forensic relevance if <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> basal SAH would result from spontaneous ruptures of pathological blood vessels, but the situation is more complex because traumatic ruptures of otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral arteries may be the only intracranial result of an injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the gross appearance, these two types of basal SAH cannot be distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In victims with external injuries and in cases with doubtful circumstances, the detection and (histological) classification of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> point(s) is necessary to distinguish between a spontaneous and traumatic origin of the rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We recommend post-mortem radiological examination of the cerebral arteries after instillation of a contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method probably allows detection of even small <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> points in the most inaccessible locations (not present in our actual series), and the radiological appearance of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> points can also be helpful in the identification of the type of arterial alteration </plain></SENT>
