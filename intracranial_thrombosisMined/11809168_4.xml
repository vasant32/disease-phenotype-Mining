<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to observe rolling and adherent platelets and to analyze adherent leukocytes and vessel diameter change in vivo using a photothrombotic vessel occlusion model.A photothrombosis, which is mediated by free radicals, was induced in male Wistar rats in the presence of a photosensitizing dye (Photofrin II) and exposure to a filtered light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">Rhodamine 6G</z:chebi>-labeled platelets and leukocytes were visualized with intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy through a closed cranial or spinal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vessel diameter, photothrombosis and leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rolling and adherent platelets were observed during irradiation through the cerebral and spinal window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before the platelets were recognized, the irradiated arteriole dilated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the photochemical occlusion of an arteriole, other arterioles also dilated and the adherent leukocytes increased in the venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The photothrombosis were almost completely composed of platelets according to electron microscopic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The arteriolar dilation rate and the number of adherent leukocytes in the cerebrum were greater than those in the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By combining the photochemical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and the fluorescence microscope techniques, we were able for the first time to observe rolling and adherent platelets and microvascular responses during photothrombosis in the cerebral and spinal microvasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that free radicals, which can lead to platelet aggregation, play an important role as a cerebral <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This model is useful for cerebral and spinal microcirculatory analysis to investigate the platelet-endothelium interaction, the platelet aggregation and the effect of free radicals on cerebral and spinal microcirculation </plain></SENT>
