<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By summing up a series of epidemiological evidence a continuous elevation of total serum cholesterol, especially <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi>, leads <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and causes the narrowing or occlusion of coronary artery which introduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> in the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the brain, it is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a lower level, 160 mg/dl or less of total serum cholesterol relates with the higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, but still with the lower incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the higher the total serum cholesterol level and the longer the period of continuous elevation is, the higher the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>And there is a U-shape relationship between the level of serum cholesterol and cerebrovascular disease as a whole with a nadir around 160 to 200 mg/dl which means an optimal range of total serum cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subject with total serum cholesterol over the optimal level may need some sort of modification in his daily life, in eating or physical exercise but not necessarily requires any pharmacological therapy </plain></SENT>
