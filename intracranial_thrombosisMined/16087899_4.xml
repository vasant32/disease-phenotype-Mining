<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pretreatment markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis are related to recanalization and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors included patients treated with IV rt-PA with occlusion on baseline transcranial Doppler (Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> [TIBI] criteria) in whom recanalization within 6 hours was monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline, the authors recorded data about demographics, vascular risk factors, the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, early CT signs, etiology, blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and time to rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors also measured plasmatic markers of coagulation (fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, Factor XIII, Factor VII) and fibrinolysis (alpha2-antiplasmin, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor, Functional Thrombin Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor [fTAFI]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score &lt; 2 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors studied 63 patients with a mean age of 67.3 +/- 12.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median NIHSS score was 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who recanalized had lower concentrations of alpha2-antiplasmin (87.5 +/- 18% vs 96.5 +/- 12.5%, p = 0.023) and fTAFI (91.7 +/- 26.7% vs 104.4 +/- 21%, p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariant logistic regression analysis showed that the level of alpha2-antiplasmin was the only predictive variable of recanalization (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91, 0.99, p = 0.038), while the NIHSS score was the only predictive variable of functional outcome (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.72, 0.92, p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Baseline levels of alpha2-antiplasmin were predictive of recanalization but were not related to the long-term outcome in patients treated with rt-PA within the first 3 hours </plain></SENT>
