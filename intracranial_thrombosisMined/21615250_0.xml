<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study of 13 patients who underwent decompressive craniectomies for malignant CVT is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had supra-tentorial cortical lesions attributable to CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was based on CT scan and MRI findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented in a poor clinical status with radiological evidence of malignant cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> as well as patients who worsened while on medical therapy underwent decompressive hemicraniectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed up, and the outcome assessed as per Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were nine females and four males with a mean age of 29.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients survived with good outcome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GOs</z:e> =5, n=5; GOS=4, n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the last follow-up (median 35 months; mean 39 months), the KPS scale was 90 for five, 80 for four and 70 for two survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, both in patients with pre-operative Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) &lt;5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Timely recognition of failure of medical management and an appropriately timed surgical intervention may help to salvage CVT patients who develop malignant cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
