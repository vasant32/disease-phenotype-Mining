<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately two per 1000 children born alive dies of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome each year in Western Europe, North America, and Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The vulnerability of the infant brain stem to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has been suggested to be a conceivable cause of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is compatible with a hypothesis that genetic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> could cause microinfarction in the brain stem during the first month of life, affecting vital centers or their blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of three common point mutations seen in families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (1691G--&gt;A in the coagulation factor V gene, 677C--&gt;T in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase gene, and the 20210G--&gt;A mutation in the prothrombin gene) could increase the risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to investigate these genetic markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> in 121 cases of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome and in relevant controls, in the expectation of a more frequent occurrence of these markers if <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is an etiological factor in sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of homozygous 1691G--&gt;A mutation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e> cases was higher than expected (odds ratio: 7.3, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-45.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies (theta;) in cases of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome of the 1691G--&gt;A, 677C--&gt;T, and 20210G--&gt;A alleles was 2.6% (1.0-5.5), 32.6% (26.8-38.9), and 0.9% (0.1-3.4), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the allele frequencies found in the background population (3.4% for the 1691G--&gt;A allele, 29% for the 677C--&gt;T allele, and 1% for the 20210G--&gt;A allele) differed significantly from that in cases of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 5,251,027 inhabitants in Denmark, the incidence of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was 0.9 per 1000 per year in the background population, and less than one-thousandth of these were children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently it is not likely that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a major cause of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, this does not exclude other known or unknown risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as possible etiological factors for sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is likely that we must continuously employ the exclusion principle on possible etiological causes in genetic material from a large group of victims of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome if the phenomenon of sudden infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> syndrome is to be ascribed to a specific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hereditary disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
