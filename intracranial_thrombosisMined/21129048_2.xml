<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This is the first nationwide study to determine familial risks of unusual forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> amongst offspring of affected parents and amongst siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTINGS: The Swedish Multigeneration Register of 0- to 75-year-old subjects was linked to the Hospital Discharge Register for the period 1987-2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for individuals whose relatives were hospitalized for venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (VTE), as determined by the International Classification of Diseases, compared to those whose relatives were not affected by VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of hospitalized patients with VTE was 45 362, of which 1824 (4.0%) were affected by a rare thrombotic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The familial SIRs in cases with a history of VTE in parents or siblings were significantly increased for migrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.31), portal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (2.35; 95% CI 1.77-3.06), vena cava <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (1.96; 95% CI 1.42-2.64) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (1.74; 95% CI 1.30-2.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002639'>Budd-Chiari syndrome</z:hpo> (SIR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.24-2.38) and renal vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (SIR, 1.72; 95% CI 0.62-3.77) were not significantly associated with parental or sibling history of VTE; however, these two conditions were very rare, and therefore, we cannot draw any definite conclusions from this finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Family history is an important risk factor for most unusual forms of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, even the paraneoplastic phenomenon, migrating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398359" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Trousseau's syndrome</z:e>), is associated with a family history of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data suggest that most rare forms of VTE have a familial background </plain></SENT>
