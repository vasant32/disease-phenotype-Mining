<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood coagulation factor VII (FVII) R353Q polymorphism increases the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to investigate the association of FVII R353Q polymorphism with the risk of puerperal CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 100 women with puerperal CVT and 102 age-matched women without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postpartum complications</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FVII R353Q genotypes were identified using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the homozygous FVII 353QQ genotype was present in 9% and 8% of patients and controls, respectively; and 42% of patients and 31.4% of controls had the heterozygous 353RQ genotype (odds ratio = 1.55, 95% confidence interval = 0.89-2.70; p = 0.243) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the FVII R353Q polymorphism is not associated with increased risk for CVT occurring during the puerperal period in Indian women </plain></SENT>
