<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The flow-diverting stent is a new option in endovascular therapy specifically designed for the endovascular reconstruction of a segmentally diseased artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety of flow-diverting stents is still equivocal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the technical aspects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, adjunctive therapies, and midterm results in patients with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with a flow-diverting stent (Silk; Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively examined angiographic images and clinical reports of 24 consecutive patients (29 stents) treated (n = 23) or attempted to treat (n = 1) with a flow-diverting device in 2 Finnish centers between March 2009 and October 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary technical success rate was 67% (16/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive therapies were required in 6 (25%) patients, including 4 cases where intra-arterial abciximab was administered for the treatment of intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Technique-related complication rate and the 30-day mortality rate were each 4% (1/24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging revealed 1 case of delayed in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> resulting in permanent disability of the patient, 1 asymptomatic occlusion, and 1 asymptomatic stenosis of the stented artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with fully patent parent artery was observed in 16 of the 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (70%) where follow-up images were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Many previously untreatable <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> may be successfully treated with the Silk flow-diverting stent, but the associated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> is justifiable only if conventional endovascular or surgical treatment options are not applicable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> should be prepared for and treated without unnecessary delays because they frequently respond to adjunctive medical therapy </plain></SENT>
