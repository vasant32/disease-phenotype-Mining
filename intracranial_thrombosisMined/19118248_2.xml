<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isolated lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was long considered a complication of middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013447" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little attention has been recently paid to this variety of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of isolated lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prospectively collected in our center (1997 to 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 195 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), we identified 157 patients with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, including 62 patients with isolated lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical, etiologic, and prognostic features were compared with those of other 133 CVT cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Sixty-two patients (32%) had isolated lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headaches</z:hpo> were present in 95% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main clinical presentation was isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in 28 patients (45%), whereas 15 (24%) had isolated intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (31%) had at least one focal sign (deficit and/or focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>Dysphasia</z:hpo> was the most common one (8 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared with the other 133 CVT cases, presentation with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> was the most frequent one (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal lesions were found in 19 cases and were less frequent than in other CVT cases (P=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Numerous causes or predisposing factors were identified without a difference in repartition with other patients with CVT, particularly for local or infectious causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of anticoagulation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was good with complete recovery in 57 patients (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient died after the occurrence of massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e> despite adequate anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Three patients had sequelae (no difference with the other CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Isolated lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a frequent variety of CVT, accounting for one third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It presents in more than two thirds of cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as the only symptom either isolated or less frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This stresses the need for CVT workup in a patient with a recent unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
