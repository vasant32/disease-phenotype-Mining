<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examines changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>), AMPA ((+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30768">propionic acid</z:chebi>) and kainate receptors following focal photothrombotic ischemic lesions using quantitative receptor autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increases in binding density of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors were seen in both hemispheres for up to 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the contralateral hemisphere, this increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors occurred as early as 4 h after lesion whereas it appeared with a delay for 14 days on the lesioned side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding density of [3H]AMPA and [3H]kainate was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the translational process is differentially regulated by spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The delayed up-regulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor binding on the lesioned side may be due to a translation block similar to that previously described for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor subunits </plain></SENT>
