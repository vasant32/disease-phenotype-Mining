<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cerebral venous and sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CVST) is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several assumptions of the incidence have been made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the one and only series of consecutive brain autopsies series by Towbin in 1973 CVST was found in 10,9 % of patients aged 60 years or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the true incidence of CVST is higher than generally thought, but there are no other reports supporting these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore in order to determine the incidence of latent CVST we conducted a new prospective post mortem study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> brain autopsies performed in our hospital between 1996 and 1998 on patients 60 years of age or older were examined for the presence of CVST in a prospective way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined the sagittal sinus, the torcula, the straight sinus, both transverse sinuses, and both sigmoideal sinuses for the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical condition, medication, brain-imaging results, clinical cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, general findings from the body autopsy and definite cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally we requested the annual mortality figures of CVST at the department of the National Agency for Statistics of the Netherlands (CBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A consecutive and prospective series of 102 brain autopsies was performed in our general hospital during a period of two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We found one case of latent CVST in our series of 102 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Comparison with the findings of Towbin using a chi-square test yielded a significant difference in the incidence of latent CVST (chi(2) = 7.65, p &lt; 0.01) between the two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present autopsy study demonstrates that latent CVST is rare </plain></SENT>
