<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506), administered alone or in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> following thrombotic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was induced by a photochemical reaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">rose bengal</z:chebi> and green light in Sprague-Dawley rats, and the volume of ischemic brain damage was determined 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of tacrolimus or t-PA dose-dependently reduced the volume of ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, whether administered immediately or 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When tacrolimus or t-PA was administered 2 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, each drug showed a tendency to reduce ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, combined treatment with both drugs resulted in a significant reduction in ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On administration 3 hours after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, tacrolimus alone showed no effect, and t-PA tended to worsen ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the combined treatment with both drugs not only ameliorated the worsening trend seen with t-PA alone, but also tended to reduce ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, tacrolimus, used in combination with t-PA, augmented therapeutic efficacy on brain damage associated with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and extended the therapeutic time window compared to single-drug treatments </plain></SENT>
