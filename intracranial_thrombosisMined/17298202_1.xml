<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Free radicals are also involved in hypoxic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the sensitivity of PT to preconditioning with hypobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and to pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In adult Wistar rats, after intravenous application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi>, a stereo-tactically defined spot on the denuded skull was irradiated by a laser for 9 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first experimental group underwent hypobaric <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> three days before irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second experimental group, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> was applied intraperitoneally one hour before irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three days after irradiation, animals were sacrificed, the brains perfused, and stained with TTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions were divided into grades (I, II, III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control group (where no manipulation preceded photothrombosis), most animals displayed deep damage involving the striatum (grade III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The group pre-exposed to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> showed similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only 28.57 % of the <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> pretreated animals exhibited grade III lesions, and in 57.14 % no signs of lesions were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pre-exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was not protective in our model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> lead to a significant reduction of the number of large ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This result is probably caused by protection of endothelial cells by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
