<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that underlying and unsuspected vascular lesions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>, may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> after IV rtPA thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a previously unreported case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from an acutely ruptured anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> after IV rtPA treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent mechanical thromboembolectomy of the left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with resultant TIMI (Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo>) grade I recanalization, followed by coil embolization of the anterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient never improved neurologically, and she ultimately died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Screening to identify patients at risk for development of hemorrhagic complications from underlying structural vascular lesions before the use of IV rtPA with computed tomography angiography should be considered </plain></SENT>
