<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a known risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but relatively few studies have been conducted in Asian populations to document the risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to analyze the incidence and etiologies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring during pregnancy and puerperium in Taiwanese women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1984 to 2002, female patients 15 through 40 years of age with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of delivery were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (IS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence, time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (1st through 3rd trimester or puerperium), and etiologies of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 402 young female <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, 49 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during pregnancy and puerperium, including 16 with IS, 11 with CVT, 19 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and 3 with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After excluding referral patients, the incidences of pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were 46.2 (95% CI 30.7-69.5) per 100,000 pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>67% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the 3rd trimester and puerperium, and 73% of CVT occurred in the puerperium period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Etiologies were well defined in 78% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100601'>Eclampsia</z:hpo> (37%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (26%) were the most important etiologies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For IS and CVT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035439" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rhd">rheumatic heart disease</z:e> (44%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> (64%) were the major etiologies respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence during pregnancy and puerperium in Taiwanese women is higher than that of Caucasian populations; the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in the 3rd trimester and puerperium, particularly CVT </plain></SENT>
