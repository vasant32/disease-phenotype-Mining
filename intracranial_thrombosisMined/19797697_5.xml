<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prompt care-seeking behavior is a focus of US national public <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> educational campaigns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined whether the time between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and hospital arrival and the receipt of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) changed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients evaluated at US academic centers between 2001 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records were abstracted for consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted from the Emergency Department within 48 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> at 35 academic medical centers participating in the University HealthSystem Consortium <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> Benchmarking Project between January 1, 2001 and March 31, 2001, and 32 centers between January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who presented within and after 2 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare time to arrival by year and to identify patient characteristics associated with earlier hospital arrival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study included 428 patients from 2001 and 481 from 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there was no difference in the percentage of patients who arrived within 2 hours between the 2 periods (37% in 2001 vs 38% in 2004, P=0.63), the percentage of these patients treated with IV t-PA increased (14.0% to 37.5%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In risk-adjusted analysis, black patients had a lower odds of arriving within 2 hours (odds ratio=0.55; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.78), whereas those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were more likely to arrive promptly (odds ratio=2.17; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no change in the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients arriving at hospitals within 2 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between 2001 and 2004; however, the rate of IV t-PA use increased, indicating system-level improvements of in-hospital care </plain></SENT>
