<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is a challenge because its clinical presentation is variable, brain CT may be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and MRI is not always available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, early treatment may be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As D-dimer (DD) measurement is a sensitive test for the exclusion of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, the authors studied whether this test could be useful in the diagnosis of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study of 54 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> suggestive of CVT was conducted between October 2000 and September 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DD levels were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the emergency room before brain CT or MRI was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve (22%) of the 54 patients had CVT, and 10 (83%) of these 12 patients had DD level of &gt;500 ng/mL (sensitivity of 83% and negative predictive value of 95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with confirmed CVT and DD of &lt;500 ng/mL had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of &gt;30 days' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 42 patients without confirmed CVT, only 4 patients had DD level of &gt;500 ng/mL (specificity of 90% and positive predictive value of 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DD test is useful in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A value below 500 ng/mL makes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> unlikely </plain></SENT>
