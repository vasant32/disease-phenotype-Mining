<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined a disease inception cohort of 1047 SLE patients to determine which autoantibodies at enrolment predicted subsequent neuropsychiatric events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a recent SLE diagnosis were assessed prospectively for up to 10 years for neuropsychiatric events using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Decision rules of graded stringency determined whether neuropsychiatric events were attributable to SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between the first neuropsychiatric event and baseline autoantibodies (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> (LA), anticardiolipin, anti-β(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I, anti-ribosomal P and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51146">NR2</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor) were tested by Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Disease duration at enrolment was 5.4 ± 4.2 months, follow-up was 3.6 ± 2.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were 89.1% female with mean (±SD) age 35.2 ± 13.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>495/1047 (47.3%) developed one or more neuropsychiatric event (total 917 events) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE were 15.4% (model A) and 28.2% (model B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At enrolment 21.9% of patients had LA, 13.4% anticardiolipin, 15.1% anti-β(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-I, 9.2% anti-ribosomal P and 13.7% anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="51146">NR2</z:chebi> antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LA at baseline was associated with subsequent intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (total n=22) attributed to SLE (model B) (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anti-ribosomal P antibody was associated with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> (total n=14) attributed to SLE (model B) (HR 3.92, 95% CI 1.23 to 12.5, p=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Other autoantibodies did not predict neuropsychiatric events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a prospective study of 1047 recently diagnosed SLE patients, LA and anti-ribosomal P antibodies are associated with an increased future risk of intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
