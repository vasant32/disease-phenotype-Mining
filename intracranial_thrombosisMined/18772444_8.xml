<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to determine the impact of intra-arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> burden on intra-arterial treatment (IAT) and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of our IAT <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database included procedure time, recanalization, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;/=4 at discharge), and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modified Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> grade was dichotomized into grades 0 to 3 (no clot or moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, &lt;2 vessel diameters) versus grade 4 (large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, &gt;2 vessel diameters) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were collected on 135 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> grading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The baseline median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was higher in patients of grade 4 compared with grades 0 to 3 (19 vs 17, P=0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade 4 thrombi required longer (median, range) times for IAT (113, 37 to 415 minutes vs 74, 22 to 215 minutes, respectively; P&lt;0.001) and higher rates of mechanical clot disruption (wire, angioplasty, snare, stent, or Merci retriever) compared with grades 0 to 3 (76% vs 53%, P=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in rates of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (6.6% vs 4.1%, P=0.701) or recanalization (50% vs 61%, P=0.216) in grade 4 versus grades 0 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, and artery of involvement showed that grade 4 thrombi were independently associated with poor outcome (odds ratio=2.4; 95% CI, 1.06 to 5.57; P=0.036) and mortality (odds ratio=4.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 13.2; P=0.023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> grade as measured by the modified Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> criteria may be a risk factor that contributes to poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
