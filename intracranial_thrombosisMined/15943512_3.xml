<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review the protected carotid stenting experience at two major referral centers to evaluate the frequency of clinically significant intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo>, use of neurorescue techniques, and ultimate clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 254 cases of protected transfemoral carotid stenting performed at the Washington University-Barnes Hospital and The Fleni Institute of Buenos Aires in a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical records of patients with periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were reviewed to determine the type of complication, method of treatment, and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 254 cases in which a carotid protection device was used, 2 (0.79%) episodes of witnessed, symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients suffered thromboembolic occlusion of the M1 branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) immediately following crossing of the internal carotid lesion with the protection device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological symptoms consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After rapid stent deployment across the carotid lesion, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was cannulated and the occlusion treated with balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was followed by selective intra-arterial delivery of urokinase and intravenous abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These maneuvers resulted in excellent restoration of blood flow in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the exception of minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0454643" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">word-finding difficulties</z:e> in one, both patients demonstrated full neurological recovery within the perioperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, intraprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occur despite the use of cerebral protection devices, but are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Notably these complications appeared to occur at the time of lesion crossing by distal cerebral protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> can be successfully treated if the complication is rapidly identified and the physician is adequately prepared and proficient in neurorescue techniques </plain></SENT>
