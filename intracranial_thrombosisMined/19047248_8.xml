<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to define the frequency, predictors, and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with cardiac surgery in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a case-control study of children (term birth to 18 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> who underwent cardiac surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children between January 1, 1992, and March 1, 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Case subjects experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 72 hours after cardiac surgery, and control subjects (2 for each case subjects) had cardiac surgery and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>/cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was calculated among children who underwent cardiac surgery during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including age, gender, simple versus complex procedure, reoperation, bypass duration, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e>, postoperative hematocrit level, and intraoperative activated clotting time, were tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of clinical and radiologically defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was the main outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologic outcomes were assessed in case subjects with the Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcome Measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study period, 30 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (28 with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 2 with cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>) were identified among 5526 children undergoing cardiac surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This yielded a risk for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>/cerebral sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of 5.4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> per 1000 children undergoing a cardiac operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis revealed that older age at the time of the procedure, longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, number of days in the hospital postoperatively, and reoperation were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, only reoperation was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of vaso-occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> undergoing cardiac surgery was 5.4 cases per 1000 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age, duration of bypass, and reoperation may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
