<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This is the first single center experience illustrating the effectiveness of the penumbra system (PS) in the treatment of large vessel occlusive disease in the arena of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The PS is an innovative mechanical thrombectomy device, employed in the revascularization of large cerebral vessel occlusions in patients via the utilization of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> platform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective, non-randomized controlled trial evaluating the clinical and functional outcome in 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intra-cranial occlusions consequent to mechanical thrombectomy by the PS either as mono-therapy or as an adjunct to current standard of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated by a neurologist and treated by our in house interventional neuro-radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Primary end-points were revascularization of the occluded target vessel to TIMI grade 2 or 3 and neurological outcome as measured by an improvement in the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete revascularization (TIMI 3) was achieved in 21/29 (72.4%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial revascularization (TIMI 2) was established in 4/29 (13.8%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Revascularization failed in four (13.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (19) patients (65.5%) had at least a four-point improvement in NIHSS scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin scale scores of &lt; or =2 were seen in 37.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no device-related adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic intra-cranial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 7% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The PS has the potential of exercising a significant impact in the interventional treatment of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the future </plain></SENT>
