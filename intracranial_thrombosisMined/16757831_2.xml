<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a rarely encountered mechanism for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multimodal monitoring may guide neurosurgical and critical care treatment in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report a 37-year-old service member who was admitted to a local field hospital for complaints of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and left ear pain during Operation Iraqi Freedom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan revealed a left temporal intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiogram revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vein of Labbe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial pressure (ICP), brain tissue oxygenation (PbO2), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive increase in ICP despite ventricular drainage, sedation, and intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an ominous decrease in brain tissue oxygen and CBF became undetectable concomitantly with the increase in ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a dramatic decrease in ICP and improvement in brain tissue oxygenation and CBF after decompression and evacuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six weeks after the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the patient was able to follow simple commands and complete short sentences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of ICP, PbO2, and laser Doppler method for obtaining CBF in the same setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Information obtained from monitoring may lead to timely decompression and avoidance of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
