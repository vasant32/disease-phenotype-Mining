<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various devices (including most extensively the Mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>Embolus</z:mpath> Removal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral Ischemia</z:hpo> [MERCI] Retriever device) have been used for this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We review the neuropathologic findings in 5 patients (age range, 59 to 87 years) who died acutely or as late as 38 days after procedures using the MERCI (4 patients) and Penumbra (1 patient) devices were carried out to remove thromboemboli from the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Partial recanalization was achieved by thrombectomy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed extensive cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, 3 of 5 with clinical hemorrhagic transformations of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> or frank intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after thrombectomy; in 1 case, this was judged to be at least partly on the basis of concomitant hypertensive microvascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With 1 exception, basal arteries examined in detail by immunohistochemistry showed prominent, although usually nonocclusive (and generally nonulcerated), atheromata, often with significant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient showed a subintimal dissection with resultant occlusion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this highly selected group of patients, the vascular pathological abnormalities affecting basal arteries were variable, but complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was a common finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extensive irreversible brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> before therapeutic procedures may have contributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
