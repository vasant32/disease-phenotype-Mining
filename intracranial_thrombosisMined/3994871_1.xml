<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> who had used oral contraceptives concentrations of circulating immune complexes were significantly higher than in healthy controls (regardless of oral contraceptive use), or in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> who had never used these preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of circulating immune complexes were not raised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, but these women had major risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> without risk factors tended to have high concentrations of circulating immune complexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data provide some confirmation that immunological mechanisms may play a role in thrombotic episodes associated with oral contraceptives, especially when they occur in the absence of risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
