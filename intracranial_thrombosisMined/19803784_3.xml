<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because cerebral perfusion pressure is often <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> under these circumstances it was hypothesized that the reduction of post-traumatic CBF has to occur at the level of the microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether cerebral microvessels are involved in the development of blood flow disturbances following experimental TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C57/BL6 mice (n = 12) were intubated and ventilated under control of end-tidal Pco(2) ((ET)P(<z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After preparation of a cranial window and baseline recordings, the animals were subjected to experimental TBI by controlled cortical impact (CCI; 6 m/sec, 0.5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel lumina and intravascular cells were visualized by in vivo fluorescence microscopy (IVM) using the fluorescent dyes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">rhodamine 6G</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameter, cell-endothelial interactions, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation were quantified within the traumatic penumbra by IVM up to 2 h after CCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar diameters increased after CCI by 26.2 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p &lt; 0.01 versus baseline), and remained at this level until the end of the observation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rolling of leukocytes on the cerebrovascular endothelium was observed both in arterioles and venules, while leukocyte-platelet aggregates were found only in venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microthrombi occluded up to 70% of venules and 33% of arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The current data suggest that the immediate post-traumatic decrease in peri-contusional blood flow is not caused by arteriolar vasoconstriction, but by platelet activation and the subsequent formation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> in the cerebral microcirculation </plain></SENT>
