<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the observed cohort mortality with its predicted 30-day <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> mortality, by using previously validated methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Selection criteria were diagnosis of hypertensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> &gt; or =35 cc, reduced level of consciousness, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frameless stereotactic puncture/clot <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> followed by intraclot external catheter placement was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two milligrams of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) was administered q12 hours until <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> volume &lt; or =10 cc, or the catheter fenestrations were no longer in continuity with the clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients were treated, mean age was 60.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> locations included basal ganglia (13), thalamic (1), and lobar (1); mean systolic blood pressure; and admission <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> volumes were 229.3 mmHg and 59.1 cc, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time from ictus to clot <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>/thrombolysis was 1 (range 0-3) day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> volume was reduced to 17% of pretreatment size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complications were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302598" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventriculitis</z:e> (6.6%) and clot enlargement (13.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients were dead at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) scores were 10.5 (4-15) at admission and 11.0 (3-15) at discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By using the most conservative estimate for analysis, probability of observing two or fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 15 patients with an overall probability of dying calculated at 0.33 was p = 0.079 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this selected cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, stereotactic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and thrombolytic washout seemed to be feasible and to have a trend towards improved 30-day survival, when using their predicted mortality data as "historical control." Complications did not exceed expected incidence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Based on the experience presented here as well as previous similar reports, a larger, randomized study addressing dose escalation, patient selection, and best therapeutic window is needed </plain></SENT>
