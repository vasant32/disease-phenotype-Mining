<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> is found in 20-30% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients might have an increased rate of a positive personal or family history of venous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the diagnostic value of a structured personal and family history for venous thrombotic events in 56 consecutive cases of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 56 patients (25%) had a hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo>, mostly factor V Leiden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with both CVT and hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> had more frequently a positive family and personal history than patients affected by CVT only but the difference was not strong enough to differ from the 42 CVT patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> (43% vs. 31%; P = 0.52 and 14% vs. 10 %; P = 0.63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a negative personal and family history of venous thrombotic events is not sufficient to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and patients with CVT should be tested for inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> regardless of the patient's past personal and family history for venous thrombotic events </plain></SENT>
