<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we explored the microvascular hemodynamic effects of this combined therapy in a laboratory model of cortical arteriolar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the cortical microcirculation of physiologically monitored rats in vivo by two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> laser-scanning microscopy after plasma-labeling with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We induced focal <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 30- to 50-microm cortical arterioles by laser irradiation and measured arteriolar flow velocity by repeated line-scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 30 minutes post-<z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, we treated animals with the thrombolytic agent, reteplase, which was coadministered with either human albumin, 2 g/kg, or with saline control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline arteriolar flow velocity averaged 3.8+/-0.7 mm/s, was immediately reduced by <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> to 22% to 25% of control values, and remained unchanged before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subthrombolytic doses of reteplase combined with saline led to a median increase in flow velocity to 37% of control distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> (P=nonsignificant versus pretreatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, reteplase combined with albumin therapy resulted in a prompt, highly significant increase of median flow velocity to 58% of control levels (P=0.013 versus reteplase+saline), which remained significantly higher than the reteplase+saline group at multiple time-points over the subsequent hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effect of subthrombolytic doses of reteplase on microvascular hemodynamics distal to a cortical arteriolar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is markedly enhanced by the coadministration of high-dose albumin therapy; these results have important clinical implications for the management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
