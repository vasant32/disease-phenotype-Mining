<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This collateral circulation involves mainly medullary and cortical veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These are difficult to assess neuroradiologically, particularly if thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>Cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is diagnosed usually based on <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of dural sinuses and of the deep venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tried to correlate the site and extent of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with the location and the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> in 26 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, to investigate whether a simple causal relationship exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between the extent and site of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in dural sinuses and the extent and location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some cases a clear relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of cortical and medullary veins and the lesions was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> alone may be well tolerated in many cases, while involvement of cortical and medullary veins leads to a worse clinical situation </plain></SENT>
