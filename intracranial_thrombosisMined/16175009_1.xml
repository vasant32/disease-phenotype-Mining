<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated these known risk factors in a population of CVT patients and investigated the role of a combination of two polymorphisms in the promoter of the protein C gene (PC promoter CG haplotype), newly described as risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective population of 26 CVT patients was compared with a control group of 84 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a multivariate analysis, we confirmed that the factor II G20210A mutation is an independent risk factor for CVT with odds ratio 4.7 (95% confidence interval, 2.83--75.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the CVT risk is increased when this mutation is associated either with the PC promoter CG haplotype (odds ratio=19.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.1--186.5) or, in females, with an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment (odds ratio=24; 95% confidence interval, 2.26--127.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this work, the association of the factor II G20210A mutation and the PC promoter CG haplotype or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> treatment seems to be a particular risk for CVT </plain></SENT>
