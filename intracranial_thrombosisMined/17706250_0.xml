<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared to clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies, few experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> studies report using serum S100B as a surrogate marker for estimating the long-term effects of neuroprotectants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study sought to observe serum S100B kinetics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models and to clarify the association between serum S100B and both final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and long-term neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to demonstrate that early elevations in serum S100B reflect successful neuroprotective treatment, a pharmacological study was performed with a non-competitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum S100B levels were significantly elevated after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, reaching peak values 48 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and declining thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single measurements of serum S100B as early as 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> correlated significantly with final <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and long-term neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum S100B was significantly attenuated by MK-801, correlating significantly with long-term beneficial effects of MK-801 on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes and neurological outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that single measurements of serum S100B 48 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> would serve as an early and simple surrogate marker for long-term evaluation of histological and neurological outcomes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PIT</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rat models </plain></SENT>
