<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An epidemiological study of cerebrovascular disease in Akabane and Asahi, Japan, was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(These cities are located near Nagoy, Japan.) The study population included 4,737 men and women aged 40 to 79 at the time of entry into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 4,186 persons who were examined and, of these, 264 cases of cerebrovascular attacks were observed between 1964 and 1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in those persons not responding to the survey was 15.9 times higher than in those persons examined according to person-year observation in Akabane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were evaluated by age-adjusted and sex-adjusted relative risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predisposing factors to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> appeared to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, high left R wave, ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, T abnormality, capillary fragility counts, previous medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, the predisposing factors appeared to be <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, ST <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and funduscopic sclerotic findings, and those factors assumed to be significant were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo> and smoking habits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ocular funduscopic abnormality was the most prominent risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, while <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>ECG abnormalities</z:hpo> were highly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that those subjects with a relatively higher blood pressure may have a higher relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> than those with a lower (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range) blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A previous or family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also appeared significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
