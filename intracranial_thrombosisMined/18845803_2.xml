<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS), whose embolic source was associated with fibrin-rich <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formed in the venous system, were more likely to improve dramatically after thrombolytic therapy than those without RLS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with tissue plasminogen activator were assessed prospectively to determine the clinical factors associated with "dramatic improvement" after tissue plasminogen activator administration. "Dramatic improvement" was defined as a &gt;/=10-point reduction in the total National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score or a total National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of 0 or 1 at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of an RLS was determined using contrast transcranial Doppler within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-four patients (26 males; mean age; 73.0+/-10.7 years; baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score,13.4+/-6.6) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had dramatic improvement (D group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast transcranial Doppler demonstrated an RLS in 17 (35.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On multivariate logistic regression analysis using <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, RLS, DWI-ASPECTS (&gt;8), baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (&lt;10), and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (&lt;120 mg/dL) as variables with a P&lt;0.1 on univariate analysis, RLS (OR, 5.9; CI,1.3 to 27.3; P=0.022) was the only independent factor associated with dramatic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of an RLS on contrast transcranial Doppler was an independent factor associated with dramatic improvement after tissue plasminogen activator administration </plain></SENT>
