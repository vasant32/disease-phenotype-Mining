<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 61-year-old man presented with the complaint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigations revealed a fusiform middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> at the M2 part </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The formation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rapidly developed to a partially thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the course of four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As regards the treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, at first we tried surgery with a superficial temporal artery middle cerebral artery bypass (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass) and trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, during the procedure, it was difficult to control <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the temporal muscle, bone flap, and subdural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of this, we finished the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass without trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and then, four days later, we confirmed bypass patency and treated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> using endovascular coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on both surgical and interventional investigations in this case and a review of the reported literature, the authors propose that there are two mechanisms causing the middle cerebral artery fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to develop thrombosed formation rapidly: (i) Peripheral middle cerebral artery branches demand less blood flow than other major trunk arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(ii) Bypass flow maintains perfusion to the distal branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, this flow alteration caused by surgical vascular bypass may promote the development of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to thrombosed formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment of a fusiform middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> at the M2 part is also discussed </plain></SENT>
