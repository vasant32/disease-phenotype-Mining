<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that C-reactive protein (CRP) is related to thromboembolic (TE) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether associations are altered in the presence of other risk factors is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to additionally assess the relation between CRP and TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: On the basis of 20 years of follow-up after CRP measurement, 259 cases of TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were identified and compared with 1348 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were aged 48 to 70 years when CRP was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of CRP were positively associated with TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> throughout the 20 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although associations were modest within 5 years of CRP measurement, the odds of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the top versus bottom CRP quartile increased over time to a 3.8-fold excess by 10 to 15 years into follow-up (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For men without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the overall corresponding odds were 1.6 to 1.7 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In men &lt;or=55 years of age, the odds increased to a 3-fold excess (P=0.006), and in nonsmokers, there was a 5.8-fold excess (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Associations in past and current smokers, in men &gt;55 years of age, and in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that elevated CRP in middle adulthood and in men with healthier risk factor profiles may be important as a risk factor for TE <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Use of CRP levels as a clinical screen to identify an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> in otherwise healthy men warrants consideration </plain></SENT>
