<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular stent placement is an emerging technique in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus far, no quantitative method is available to determine the effectiveness of stent deployment in reducing intraaneurysmal flow circulation, and thereby, in excluding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from the cerebral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to develop a mathematical model congruent with flow transport phenomena observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and based on the washout of angiographic contrast medium from these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> to provide quantitative indices for predicting the likelihood of stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation after stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angiographic data from an in vitro experiment involving an elastomer side-wall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model and data from five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A region of interest (ROI) delineating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was selected in each case, and the temporal variation in average gray-scale intensity within this ROI was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mathematical model was fit to the gray-scale intensity curves by using least-squares minimization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variations in model parameters before and after stent placement were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A marked variation in the model parameters was observed in both in vitro cases and when data suitable for mathematical modeling were available from the clinical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This variation supported the hypothesis of the model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, we conclude that the model developed herein can be used to quantitatively depict and characterize alterations in aneurysmal blood-flow transport before and after endovascular stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By inference, future versions of the model will be useful in predicting the long-term effectiveness of endovascular stent placement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> immediately after the procedure is performed </plain></SENT>
