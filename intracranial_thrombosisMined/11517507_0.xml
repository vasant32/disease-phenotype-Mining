<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 49-year-old woman had developed pontine <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> twice during the last two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed by neurologists as having cavernous malformation in the brain stem, and then referred to our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examinations showed left hemi motor and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e>, right abducent palsy and right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260662" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">auditory disturbance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a high density mass in the brain stem considered as a <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> with slight enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a high intensity mass in T1 and T2 weighted MRI with marginal hemosiderin rim, but neither flow void sign nor enhancement effect was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography depicted no abnormal vasculature in the posterior fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion 43 days after a second <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Midline sub-occipital craniotomy and the infrafacial route were chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgery was troubled by arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and pathological examination revealed a thrombosed <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She newly developed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, right abducent palsy and disturbance of right conjugate gaze, but she is recovering step by step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the radiological feature of thrombosed <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in the brain stem is similar to that of cavernous malformation, the operative procedure for thrombosed <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> is very difficult due to aggressive arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> that easily leads to surgical injury in the small surgical corridor in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We reported a rare case that was pathologically well identified as thrombosed <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in the brain stem focusing on its differential diagnosis and surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
