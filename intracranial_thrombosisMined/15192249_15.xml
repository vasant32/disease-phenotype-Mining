<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Elevated plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> are associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep-vein thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a case-control study, we examined the potential association among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels, and the common C677--&gt;T mutation in the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) gene in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with CVT and 90 control subjects were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (fasting and after methionine load), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of the MTHFR gene was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated risk of CVT associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, low vitamin levels, and MTHFR mutation were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI (crude and after adjusting by other independent variables) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The adjusted OR for CVT associated with high (&gt;90th percentile) fasting levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was 4.6 (1.6 to 12.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association between low plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> values (&lt;10th percentile) and presence of CVT was 3.5 (1.2 to 10.0) after adjustment for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a higher frequency of MTHFR mutation in patients with CVT (22% versus 10%), but it was not statistically significant (P=0.098) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with MTHFR mutation and low <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels presented the highest <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> and low plasma <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> levels were associated with an increased risk of CVT in this population in which low socioeconomic conditions and deficient nutritional status may contribute to its relatively high incidence </plain></SENT>
