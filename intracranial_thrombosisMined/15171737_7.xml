<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> (hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi>) is an established risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but has not been clearly associated with increased risk of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the prevalence of hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and other thrombophilic risk factors in a population of 26 consecutive patients with non-pyogenic CVT, by review of a prospectively maintained database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalences of hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and prothrombin G20210A, factor V G1691A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutations in these patients were compared with those in 100 healthy controls and 100 patients with cerebroarterial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> was greater in patients with CVT (10/26, 38.5%) than healthy controls (13/100; OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.58-11.16) and comparable with that in patients with cerebroarterial disease (42/100) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the prevalences of prothrombin or MTHFR mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No factor V mutation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> is associated with an increased risk of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional prospective cohort studies on large series of patients are required to clarify the time relationship between hyper-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">Hcy</z:chebi> and the thrombotic event </plain></SENT>
