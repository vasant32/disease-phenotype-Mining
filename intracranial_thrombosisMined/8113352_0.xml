<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the cardiac dysfunction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>) patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period, non-invasive studies were performed on 45 cerebral infarction patients (CI group: 25 males and 16 females, mean age 64.1 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty hospitalized patient without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> served as controls (non-CI group: 23 males and 19 females, mean age 64.8 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CI and non-CI group were divided into two sub-groups: patients with a past history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (HT) and without (NT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In each sub-group, the cardiac functions were compared between CI and non-CI by M-mode and Doppler echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In echocardiography, research based on the premise that the function of the left ventricle can be divided into preload (EDVi), afterload (SVR), contractility (EF, mVcf, SBP/ESV) and distensibility (E/A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On results show that there were no significant differences in preload, afterload and contractility of the left ventricle between CI and non-CI group in each HT and NT sub group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a significant difference was demonstrated in the diastolic function the left ventricle between the two groups in the HT (p = 0.007) and NT (p = 0.04) sub-groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, left ventricle diastolic function was deteriorated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> patients although systolic function not deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because diastolic dysfunction may be caused by existing latent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and/or silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>, echocardiographic study is useful for early detection of left ventricle impairments in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
