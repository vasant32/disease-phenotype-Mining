<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The relative importance of previous diagnosis and hereditary prothrombotic risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) in children in determining risk of a second cerebral or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (VT), compared with other clinical, neuroimaging, and treatment variables, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We followed up the survivors of 396 consecutively enrolled patients with CVT, aged newborn to 18 years (median 5.2 years) for a median of 36 months (maximum 85 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In accordance with international treatment guidelines, 250 children (65%) received <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anticoagulation with unfractionated <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, followed by secondary anticoagulation prophylaxis with low-molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in 165 (43%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 396 children enrolled, 12 died immediately and 22 (6%) had recurrent VT (13 cerebral; 3%) at a median of 6 months (range 0.1-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeat venous imaging was available in 266 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent VT only occurred in children whose first CVT was diagnosed after age 2 years; the underlying medical condition had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Cox regression analyses, non-administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> before relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 11.2 95% CI 3.4-37.0; p&lt;0.0001), persistent occlusion on repeat venous imaging (4.1, 1.1-14.8; p=0.032), and heterozygosity for the G20210A mutation in factor II (4.3, 1.1-16.2; p=0.034) were independently associated with recurrent VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among patients who had recurrent VT, 70% (15) occurred within the 6 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age at CVT <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, non-administration of anticoagulation, persistent venous occlusion, and presence of G20210A mutation in factor II predict recurrent VT in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Secondary prophylactic anticoagulation should be given on a patient-to-patient basis in children with newly identified CVT and at high risk of recurrent VT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Factors that affect recanalisation need further research </plain></SENT>
