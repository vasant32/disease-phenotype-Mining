<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether very old patients benefit from organized inpatient (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit) care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to compare the clinical outcome of patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> aged either &gt;or=80 or &lt;80 years who were treated conservatively (without cerebral revascularization) in a university-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 147 (11%) patients &gt;or=80 years and 1241 (89%) patients, &lt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical examination, blood tests, electrocardiography (ECG), brain imaging and cerebrovascular ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additional investigations were done at the discretion of the treating physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin scale (mRS) score was used to assess the 3-month outcome (favorable: mRS, 0-1; poor: mRS, 2-6; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of any cause) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> severity did not differ between both groups [median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, 4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Younger patients underwent magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging of the brain, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and catheter angiography and echocardiography (p&lt;0.001) more frequently, whereas older patients underwent computed tomography of the brain and 24-hour ECG (p&lt;0.001) more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> prevention included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (p&lt;0.001) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (p=0.047) more often in older patients and aspirin (p=0.016) in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent ischemic events were similarly frequent in old (7%) and young (5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome was equally prevalent in old (71%) and young (76%) patients, whereas mortality was higher in older patients (7 and 3%, p=0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Admission NIHSS score &gt;or=12 was the only independent predictor of unfavorable outcome (odds ratio, 19.6; 95% confidence interval, 9.7-39.6; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our work provides further evidence that also the oldest patients may benefit from conservative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit care </plain></SENT>
