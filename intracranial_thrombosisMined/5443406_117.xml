<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> following the use of oral contraceptives received by drug safety committees in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark have been analysed to investigate possible differences in the risks associated with the various preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose the numbers of reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> attributed to each product were compared with the distribution that would have been expected from market research estimates of sales, assuming that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> products carried the same risk.A positive correlation was found between the dose of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, and coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the United Kingdom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A similar association was found for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> in Sweden and Denmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant differences could be detected between sequential and combined preparations containing the same doses of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>, nor between the two <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50114">oestrogens</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyloestradiol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6784">mestranol</z:chebi>.Certain discrepancies in the data suggest that the dose of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> may not be the only factor related to the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>; thus there was a significant deficit of reports associated with the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6784">mestranol</z:chebi> 100 mug. with norethynodrel 2.5 mg. and a significant excess of reports associated with the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4903">ethinyloestradiol</z:chebi> 50 mug. with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6723">megestrol acetate</z:chebi> 4 mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An excess of reports also occurred with other combined preparations containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6723">megestrol acetate</z:chebi>.The data obtained in earlier epidemiological studies were re-examined and, though no trend was obvious in any one of them, the combined results showed an excess of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> at the highest dose of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>.The finding of a positive correlation between the dose of <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> and the risk of coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is of special interest since previous studies have failed to provide clear evidence of a relationship between oral contraceptives and this condition </plain></SENT>
