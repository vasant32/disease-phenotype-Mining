<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances, the clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) remain incompletely characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no case series have been reported from North American centers with detailed long-term outcome data, and few studies have evaluated recanalization rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of CVT at a single tertiary care hospital between 1995 and 2004 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information was obtained from direct patient interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 58 of 61 CVT patients (median 50 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average age was 40, and 66% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> and focal neurological deficits were noted in 82% and 72%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was seen in 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypercoagulable risk factors were identified in 84% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation was initiated acutely in 84%, including in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with intraparenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (IPH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with a modified Rankin Score (mRS) of 0 to 2 at admission, hospital discharge and last follow-up were 41%, 67%, 90%, respectively; the rate of favorable long-term outcome did not differ significantly between patients with and without IPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the subset of 21 patients with follow-up imaging available for direct review, 90% had partial or complete recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demographics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and risk factors in this large North American cohort of CVT patients strongly support the observations of previous European case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the favorable long-term outcome and recanalization rates observed lend further support to the safety and efficacy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy for the treatment of symptomatic CVT (irrespective of the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
