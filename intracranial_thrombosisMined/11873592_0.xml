<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to evaluate TAT complexes in the blood of ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>25 persons with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 15 controls took part in the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Taking into consideration brain CT outcomes 2 groups of patients were selected: with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of small and great extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were also divided into a group of patients with less severe and with more severe ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and into a group of patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with and without accompanying <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TAT complexes were determined with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method on days 1st, 5th, and 12th after ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TAT complexes were significantly higher in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> than in controls, significantly higher in patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of great extent compared to patients with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of small extent, and significantly higher in patients with more severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> than in patients with less severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
