<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of internal structures and its polymorphism make it a challenging task to quantitatively analyze shape differences among subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, diffusion tensor Imaging (DTI) and tract tracing technique were applied to incorporate cortical connectivity information to the morphological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CC was parcellated into six major subdivisions based on trajectories to different cortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This subdivision was performed for eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parcellated CCs of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were normalized for morphological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When comparing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population, we detected significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the motor and sensory areas of the patient CC, in line with the clinical deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This approach provides a new tool to investigate callosal <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and functional relationships </plain></SENT>
