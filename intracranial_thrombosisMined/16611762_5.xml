<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of intra-arterial RP or UK in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, however, has yet to be proved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aim to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RP compared with UK in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with large vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted of cases from a prospectively collected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> data base on consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with large vessel occlusion by digital subtraction angiography treated with intra-arterial RP or UK </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients received RP and 22 received UK (mean doses, 2.5 +/- 1.4 mg and 690,000 +/- 562,000 U, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Vascular occlusions</z:e> included 9 basilar arteries (BAs), 7 internal carotid arteries (ICAs), and 17 middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) with RP and 9 BAs, 4 ICAs, and 9 MCAs with UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scales were as follows: 16 (range, 5-25; 81% &gt; or = 10) with RP and 17 (range, 6-38; 85% &gt; or =10) with UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to thrombolytic initiation: 333 +/- 230 minutes with RP and 343 +/- 169 minutes with UK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recanalization rates were as follows: 82% with RP and 64% with UK (P = .13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> rates were as follows: 12% with RP and 4.5% with UK (P = .50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 24% with RP and 27% with UK (P = .8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although limited in statistical power, our study suggests that, although IA thrombolysis with RP shows a trend for higher recanalization rates and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates, IA thrombolysis with RP is not significantly different in recanalization, outcome, mortality, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> compared with that of UK or rates reported with IA pro-UK </plain></SENT>
