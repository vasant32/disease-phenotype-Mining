<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective study was to report the morphological characteristics and results of surgical and endovascular treatment of basilar artery (BA) trunk saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients with 22 BA trunk saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent surgery including endovascular intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this series, BA trunk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> showed characteristic features such as so-called lateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (41%), multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (32%), including two de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and various vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven craniotomies for neck clipping were performed for 11 ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in one of these cases, we abandoned neck clipping, because of concern for neck tearing, and embolized it later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five ruptured and five unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully treated by endovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Another one incompletely embolized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had grown to a huge size, and the patient underwent a Hunterian ligation with a flow reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The unusually high incidence of various associated vascular anomalies suggests that focal wall <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> must be based on the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> initiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment neurological state was predictive for clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And, clinical outcomes in this series were not affected by the choice of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, considering that three of 11 surgical cases needed subsequent treatment, endovascular surgery should be considered as a first choice </plain></SENT>
