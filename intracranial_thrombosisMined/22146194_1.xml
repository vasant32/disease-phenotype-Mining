<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to use in-vivo imaging to investigate the cerebral microcirculation after experimental SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was induced in C57/BL6 mice by endovascular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pial arterioles and venules (10 to 80 Î¼m diameter) were examined using in-vivo fluorescence microscopy, 3, 6, and 72 hours after SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venular diameter or flow was not affected by SAH, while &gt;70% of arterioles constricted by 22% to 33% up to 3 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (P&lt;0.05 versus sham) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The smaller the investigated arterioles, the more pronounced the constriction (r(2)=0.92, P&lt;0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Approximately 30% of constricted arterioles were occluded by microthrombi and the frequency of arteriolar microthrombosis correlated with the degree of constriction (r(2)=0.93, P&lt;0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The current study demonstrates that SAH induces microarterial constrictions and microthrombosis in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may explain the early CPP-independent decrease in cerebral blood flow after SAH and may therefore serve as novel targets for the treatment of early perfusion deficits after SAH </plain></SENT>
