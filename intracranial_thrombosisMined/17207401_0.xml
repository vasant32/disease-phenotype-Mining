<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Determine the frequency of late complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) among IMSS-insured population in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, México </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 252 diabetic patients selected by a systematized and stratified randomized sampling including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient files available in the Family Medicine Unit 1 in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The information was taken from the clinical charts got by family physicians and specialists </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was found in 168 cases (67%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> in 148 (59.4%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> in 106 (42.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> in 89 (35.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> in 69 (27.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in 51 (20.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206172" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic foot</z:e> in 27 (10.8%), ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiopathy</z:e> in 25 (10%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in 11 (4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The period between DM diagnosis and the appearance of complications was 3.2 to 13.1 years </plain></SENT>
