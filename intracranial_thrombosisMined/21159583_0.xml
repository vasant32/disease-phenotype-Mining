<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In front of this early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, in spite of the absence of preliminary treatment by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, the "<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-dependent" anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> antibodies ELISA assay was realized and turned out to be strongly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of the negativity of the specific functional tests, the heparinotherapy was substituted by a treatment by danaparo√Ød of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, allowing a clinico-biological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the low score of HIT imputability, we realized a specific antibodies anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> alone assay which was strongly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This specific positivity probably explains the positivity of the antibodies anti <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4 </z:chebi>"<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-dependent" assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The originality of this case lies in the young age of the patient and in the probably pathogenic character of these unusual antibodies, in addition markers of an auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
