<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Both application of neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and constraint-induced movement therapy like forced arm use have been shown to potentially improve outcome after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to check whether postischemic long-term outcome correlates to specific modifications in the abundance of various neurotransmitter receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and assigned to various treatment groups (n=5 each) with end points at 3 and 6 weeks: (1) ischemic control (saline); (2) BDNF (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 20 microg BDNF); (3) forced arm use (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, saline, and ipsilateral plaster cast for 5 or 14 days for the 3- and 6-week groups, respectively); and (4) combined treatment (combi; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 20 microg BDNF, forced arm use) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals received intravenous bolus infusions of saline or BDNF 1 hour 3 and 5 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A group of sham rats (n=2) served as a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A battery of behavioral tests was performed before and up to 6 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography was performed on 12-microm-thick cryostat sections using [(3)H]MK-801, [(3)H]AMPA, and [(3)H]muscimol for labeling of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, AMPA, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Best functional outcome was seen after BDNF treatment, whereas vice versa rats with forced arm use did worse in behavioral performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved behavioral outcome was associated with increased perilesional binding densities of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and AMPA receptors 3 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that transient enhanced neurotransmission as reflected by increased ligand binding of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> and AMPA receptors may participate in successful postlesional reorganization processes </plain></SENT>
