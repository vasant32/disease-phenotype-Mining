<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of Hb Sabine patient with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, unusually high Hb F level and severe central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system thrombotic disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have tried to elucidate possible genetic background of this unusual Hb Sabine phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extremely high level of Hb F and rather mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in our patient could be partially explained by the presence of G gamma Xmn I polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case of Hb Sabine, unlike <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other reported to date, shows extremely severe thromboembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is our opinion that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercoagulable state</z:e> described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> is not the only factor responsible for this specific clinical state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of MTHFR C677T mutation in heterozygous state found in our patient and unstable Hb Sabine molecules could contribute to development of thromboembolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether other factors participate in pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this paper we emphasize different genetic background of father and son both affected with Hb Sabine, but with markedly different severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
