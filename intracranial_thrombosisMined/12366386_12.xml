<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb 761) has been reported to alleviate cerebrovascular problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the antithrombotic effects of EGb 761 in cerebral blood vessels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, EGb 761 was administered orally to SHRSP/Izm at 60 and 120 mg/kg each day for 3 weeks from the age of 7 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age-related increase in blood pressure observed in SHRSP was suppressed significantly by EGb 761 at both doses 3 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thrombotic potential was assessed in vivo using a He-Ne laser-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> model and was significantly suppressed by EGb 761 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The anti-oxidant effects of EGb 761 were determined by measurement of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 120 mg/kg, EGb 761 decreased 8-OHdG significantly compared with control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Urinary <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate, nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) metabolites, were increased significantly after administration of EGb 761 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was measured using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The expression of eNOS <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the EGb 761 group (120 mg/kg) was significantly higher than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that EGb 761 decreases blood pressure and mediates strong antithrombotic and anti-oxidant effects in SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These pharmacological activities may contribute to the beneficial properties of EGb 761 observed in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
