<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The binding density of [3H]muscimol to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors was markedly increased in the "core" of the lesion during the first week, reaching a maximum on the third day post-lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, it dropped in the exofocal primary somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reductions in the binding density of [3H]muscimol were also found in remote cortical areas of the contralateral hemisphere and lasted for several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the down-regulation of apparent binding density of [3H]muscimol, a long-lasting up-regulation of that of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(B) receptors was measured in the exofocal primary somatosensory cortex and in remote cortical areas of both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase in the binding density of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> was seen on the seventh day in the surroundings of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that widespread alterations in the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(B) receptors are induced in remote cortical areas by a focal ischaemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor affinity is regulated by nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, we suggest that the observed down-regulation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptors may be correlated with a lesion-induced increase in nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, whereas the up-regulation of GABAB receptors might be caused by other mechanisms, e.g., compensatory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the centre of the lesion, however, a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(A) receptor-mediated mechanism, which limits the spread of lesion-induced hyperexcitability, is thought to be involved </plain></SENT>
