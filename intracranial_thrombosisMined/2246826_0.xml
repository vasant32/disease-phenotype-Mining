<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the right cortical vein was diagnosed by brain images using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in addition to the clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this time, a plasma level of fibrinogen measured by the thrombin time method had decreased to 84 mg/dl, while its antigenicity was 276 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of activation of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis system nor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mixing test with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma disclosed the absence of an inhibitory factor against fibrin polymerization in her plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen levels as assessed by the thrombin time method recovered to the antigenicity level one and half months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between the activity and antigenicity of fibrinogen indicated the occurrence of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo>, probably induced by antileukemic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is suggested that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011901'>dysfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> is a possible cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in this patient </plain></SENT>
