<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve tertiary-care centers in 8 Asian countries participated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women aged 15-45 years were included if they had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> supported by neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data on age, risk factor history, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism and discharge status were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 958 subjects were included, their mean age was 34 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Large-vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> comprised 24%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> 21%, cardioembolism 19% and small-vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (29%), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (14%), pregnancy (11%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001654'>valvular heart disease</z:hpo> (10%) and cigarette smoking (3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> was found in 42%, and mortality was 4%; at discharge, 17% had modified Rankin score (mRS) &gt;4 and 83% mRS 0-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unlike among Caucasians, large-vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and cardioembolism are common among young Asian women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A high proportion are pregnancy-related </plain></SENT>
