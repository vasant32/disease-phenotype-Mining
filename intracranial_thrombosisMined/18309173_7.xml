<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to compare efficacy and potential complications of 2 commercially available devices for mechanical thromboembolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Devices were tested in an established animal model allowing the use of routine angiography catheters and thrombectomy devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radio-opaque <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were used for visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>-device interaction during angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Merci Retrieval System and the Catch Thromboembolectomy System were assessed each in 10 vessel occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For every occluded vessel up to 5 retrieval attempts were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sufficient recanalization was achieved with the Merci Retriever in 90% of occlusions, and with the Catch device recanalization was achieved in 70% of occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization at the first attempt occurred significantly more often with the Merci Retriever compared to the Catch device (OR, 21; 95% CI, 1.78-248.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consequently, significantly more attempts (P=0.02) had to be performed with the Catch device; therefore, time to recanalization was longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Thrombus</z:e> fragmentations during retrieval were caused more often by the Catch device compared to the Merci Retriever (OR, 15.6; 95% CI, 1.73-140.84), resulting in a higher distal embolization rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During retrieval both devices lost thrombotic material at the tip of the guide catheter, which was then aspirated in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both distal devices are effective for thromboembolectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To avoid loss of thrombotic material and distal embolization, the use of large <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> balloon guide catheters and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> during retrieval seems to be mandatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The design of the Merci Retriever appears to be more efficient during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> mobilization and retrieval with less fragmentation compared to the Catch Thromboembolectomy System </plain></SENT>
