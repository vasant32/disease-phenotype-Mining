<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">Rofecoxib</z:chebi> was withdrawn from the market worldwide because of concerns relating to cardiovascular safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is conflicting evidence as to whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi>, the most popular alternative to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi>, carries the same cardiovascular risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study's aim was to compare the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> with patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Prescription event monitoring methodology was used in this prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study, in which cohorts of patients were established from prescription data and thrombotic cardiovascular events were identified from follow-up questionnaires to patients' doctors and other sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: New Zealand patients with at least one prescription for either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> between 1 December 2000 and 30 November 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANALYSIS: For this interim analysis the total cohorts were separated into three groups at different stages of follow-up: complete, incomplete and no follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox's proportional hazards models were applied to calculate hazard ratios for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total cohorts included 26,403 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> and 32,446 patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4882 (18%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> and 6267 (19%) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> patients had been completely followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group the unadjusted hazard ratio for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> was 1.07 (95% CI 0.59, 1.93) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age this hazard ratio was 0.94 (95% CI 0.51, 1.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further adjustment for sex, 'as required' use, indication for use, concomitant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> use and pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> resulted in only minor changes to the hazard ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This interim analysis of the Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme data suggests that in 'real-life' postmarketing use in New Zealand there is no significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41423">celecoxib</z:chebi> compared with those taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8887">rofecoxib</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
