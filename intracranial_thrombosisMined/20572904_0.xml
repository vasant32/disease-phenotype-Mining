<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report reocclusion detection after endovascular clot <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, followed by administration of GPIIb-IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> under continuous ultrasound monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old man developed the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion with NIHSS 17 points, 6 days after aortic valve replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was achieved with Penumbraâ„¢ system and reocclusion was detected with transcranial Doppler (TCD) 30 minutes postcompletion of intra-arterial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Proximal recanalization was achieved with the second <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> while M2 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion persisted beyond the reach of the device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous abciximab was administered under continuous TCD monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization with Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain Ischemia</z:e> (TIBI) flow grade 4 was observed at 60 minutes postintervention accompanied with clinical recovery to NIHSS 3 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abciximab was given for 12 hours with no hemorrhagic transformation on repeat CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient was discharged home with mild left pronator drift and facial droop, and his modified ranking score was 1 at 6-week follow-up visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early arterial reocclusion can occur after successful <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> while GPIIb-IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> administration may lead to subsequent recanalization of persisting distal occlusions not amenable to mechanical removal </plain></SENT>
