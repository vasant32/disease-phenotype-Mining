<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients who are clinically asymptomatic, hyperdense visualization of the basilar artery can be observed, if scanned with a double helical CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Purpose of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic significance of these changes seen at double-helical CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ten patients patients underwent double-helical CT of a portion of the base of the skull </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each case, 5-mm and 10-mm fused slices were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patency of the visualized vessels was then documented using contrast-enhanced images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The differences in attenuation between the 5-mm and 10-mm fused slices obtained at native examinations were a median 11 HU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent contrast enhanced studies documented patency of the examined vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present data show that the hyperdense basilar artery as a sign of thrombotic occlusion is not valid when thin, fused slices are obtained at double-helical CT </plain></SENT>
