<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been described as its only clinical presentation in 15 % of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no typical pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to study the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as the sole manifestation of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From a prospective study of 30 consecutive patients diagnosed with CVT over 18 months, we selected those who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> only: they had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological examination, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> and no blood or any parenchymal lesion on CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were submitted to a systematic etiological workup and a structured questionnaire about the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the sole manifestation of CVT in 12 patients; it was diffuse or bilateral in the majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients referred worsening with sleep/lying down, Valsalva maneuvers or straining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no association between the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and extension of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to diagnosis was significantly delayed in these patients presenting only with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our series, 40 % of patients presented only with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no uniform pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> apart from being bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a significant delay of diagnosis in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Some characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> should raise the suspicion of CVT: recent persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, thunderclap <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or pain worsening with straining, sleep/lying down or Valsalva maneuvers even in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">papilloedema</z:e> or focal signs </plain></SENT>
