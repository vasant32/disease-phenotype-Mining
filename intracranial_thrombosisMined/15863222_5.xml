<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous research has shown that prolonged exposure to <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> can interfere with recovery of function and exaggerate tissue loss after brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi>, a widely used hypnotic drug, on functional and histological outcome after cortical photothrombosis in aged rats, which might be particularly vulnerable to brain insults and inhibitory sedative-hypnotic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aged Wistar rats were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> at a dose of 3 mg/kg (i.p., once a day) beginning 4 days before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction and continuing for 23 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensorimotor recovery was assessed by a new ledged beam-walking test and spatial learning by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water-maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a 7-day washout period <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were administered a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg, i.p.) and retested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> volumes were measured from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi>-stained sections at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beam-walking data showed that ischemic rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> were not more impaired than untreated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, they showed fewer faults with the impaired hindlimb than ischemic controls on post-operative day 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Water-maze performance was not affected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After the washout period a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> did not worsen forelimb or hindlimb function, but seemed to improve performance in the water-maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes were similar in ischemic controls and ischemic rats treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32315,53762">zopiclone</z:chebi> was not detrimental and even seemed to improve behavioral outcome without affecting ischemic damage in aged rats subjected to cortical photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
