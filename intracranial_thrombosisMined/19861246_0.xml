<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples of 50 pregnant women and parturients with CVT and 52 matched healthy women for molecular analysis using a PCR/DHPLC assay followed by DNA sequence analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten primer pairs were designed for amplifying the AT- III promoter region and exons 1-6 including the exon/intron boundaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A rapid screening assay based on DHPLC was established to screen the mutation and polymorphisms of AT- III gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six abnormal peaks were detected in 40 of the patients by DHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct DNA sequencing was performed on representative samples detected by DHPLC profiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One pathogenic heterozygous G13328A missense mutation in exon 6, and a novel silent mutation in exon 4+243 G&gt;A were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were found, including 4 previously reported ones in the SNP library and two were novel SNP sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An abnormal peak was detected in the control group by DHPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DHPLC allows automated and rapid high-throughput detection of AT- III gene mutation and polymorphisms in the clinical setting and prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested that AT- III gene mutation, as well as its polymorphisms, contributes to the occurrence of CVT in pregnant women and parturients </plain></SENT>
