<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) is usually achieved by digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography, while structural brain tissue damage can be assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging (PWI, DWI) we aimed in this study to identify pathophysiological patterns corresponding to only functional and hence reversible tissue involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PWI, DWI, and conventional MRI were performed in six CVT patients acutely and after 16-26 days when their clinical condition had improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with partial thromboplastin time-effective intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After intravenous administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent, bolus track PWI allows pixel based determination of mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DWI was performed with two different b values (0, 1000 s/mm2) for calculation of apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In five of six cases increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> values were observed initially, whereas the CBV was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, indicating a reduction of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On follow up after clinical recovery <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> prolongations had resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Areas with prolonged <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> did not evolve into structural lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with CVT, prolongations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> in the absence of changes in CBV and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> seem to indicate reversible involvement of brain tissue, a situation corresponding to the ischaemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
