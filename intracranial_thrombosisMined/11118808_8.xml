<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During pathological conditions, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) rapidly form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, a potent cytotoxin, causing symptoms referred to as <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> response </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>NO derives from 3 NO-synthases (NOS I-III) from which the calcium-dependent NOS-I and III are activated rapidly due to hyperexcitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the induction of COX-2 by immunohistochemistry at days 1, 2 and 5 following cortical photothrombosis in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and MK-801 treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed a weak constitutive, neuronal expression of COX-2 in cortex and amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Layers II+III contained considerably more COX-2 than infragranular layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One and 2 days following injury COX-2 was highly upregulated in the supragranular layers of the whole injured hemisphere compared with sham-operated animals and compared to the contralateral unlesioned hemisphere, whereas at day 5 COX-2 levels had returned to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MK-801 treatment caused a reduction in COX-2 upregulation at day one and by day 2 no significant differences between injured and contralateral hemisphere were measurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>COX-2 positive neurons were found in close association with NOS-I containing neurons and their fibers but were not colocalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, codistribution of COX-2 was found with HO-1, CuZn-SOD and GPx containing cells, whereas COX-2 was colocalized with HO-2 and/or MnSOD in cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
