<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The association between hemostatic activation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism, and outcome is poorly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Hemostatic System Activation Study (HAS) investigators measured serial levels of prothrombin fragment F1.2, a marker of thrombin generation, in patients enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> Aspirin Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study (WARSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HAS enrolled 631 of the 2,206 patients in WARSS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were subtyped according to inferred mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma was collected for F1.2 at randomization (within 30 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), 3 months, 12 months, and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3 to 6 month samples in aspirin-treated patients were used for the primary analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors analyzed 3 to 6 month samples on 320 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher F1.2 levels were associated with older age, female sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between mean F1.2 levels in 56 cryptogenic (0.9 +/- 0.32 nmol/L) and 114 non-cryptogenic (1.13 +/- 0.74 nmol/L) patients or across specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was an 8.8%/year (p = 0.006) increase in mean F1.2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a trend toward higher risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as F1.2 levels increased in aspirin (RR: 1.30, 95% CI: 0.57 to 2.94, p = 0.53) and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> treated patients (RR: 1.68, 95% CI: 0.48 to 5.94, p = 0.42) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>F1.2 levels were reduced on average 70% in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>-treated patients in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: F1.2 levels did not appear to differ by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype, suggesting that factors other than underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathophysiology influence thrombin generation in the post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>F1.2 levels were suppressed by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additional research is needed to determine the predictive value of F1.2 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
