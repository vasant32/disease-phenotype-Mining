<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The influences of a stent on the outcome of embolized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the angiographic follow-up (FU) results of stent-remodeled (StR) and non-remodeled (nonR) coil embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven StR patients with FU digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were matched with 37 nonR patients according to presentation (ruptured or unruptured), location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (sidewall or bifurcation), initial sac occlusion (complete/near complete or incomplete/failure), and the sac size (largest diameter/less than 2 mm difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The baseline clinical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> characteristics, initial/FU treatment success rates, and FU DSA findings between the StR and nonR groups with regard to the morphologic features (size and location) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were assessed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The StR group showed more frequent progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> compared to the nonR group (56.8 vs. 27.0%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These differences were more prominent for small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (70 vs. 25%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> showed a lower rate of FU recanalization in the StR group compared to the nonR group (0 vs. 25%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sidewall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> also showed a higher rate of progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the StR group (61.1 vs. 27.8%; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Coil embolization is an effective treatment method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, however, changes on follow-up may affect the long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stent remodeling may aid in preserving and enhancing the treatment durability especially in small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
