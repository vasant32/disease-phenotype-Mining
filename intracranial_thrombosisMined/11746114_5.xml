<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are several problems inherent in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e>, such as the narrow therapeutic time window and the severe side effects of fibrinolytic drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is thus need of a new method of removing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0936263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral thrombus</z:e> more rapidly using smaller amounts of fibrinolytics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The liquid-jet generator was made by insertion of an optical fiber (diameter: 0.6 mm) into a balloon catheter (6 Fr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pulsed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49648">holmium</z:chebi> (Ho) YAG laser (pulse duration time = 350 micros) was used as a laser source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum penetration depth of a liquid jet generated with this device into a gelatin artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was measured at various stand-off distances (L; distance between the optical fiber end and the catheter exit) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the result, a stand-off distance of 13 mm was chosen to investigate the enhancement of urokinase (UK) efficacy by only a single operation of the liquid-jet device in artificial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> made of human blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Maximum penetration depth increased in proportion to L and reached a maximum value (9 mm) when L was around 13 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolysis rates (%) after incubation with a small amount of UK for 10 and 30 minutes were predominantly raised by a single use of the laser-induced liquid jet (5.4 +/- 2.4 vs. 22.6 +/- 6.1 and 7.3 +/- 3.8 vs. 38.3 +/- 5.6, respectively (mean +/- SD, P &lt; 0.001)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A laser-induced liquid jet effectively promoted fibrinolysis in vitro with use of only a small amount of fibrinolytics </plain></SENT>
