<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort study was done in 12 centers admitting 5515 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multilevel logistic regression model was used to relate the likelihood of treatment with thrombolysis to characteristics of the organizational culture of the centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Organizational culture was defined by 10 characteristics and scored by a panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sum score was created by adding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scores and dividing by 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thrombolysis rates varied from 5.7% to 21.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed an association between thrombolysis and the availability of informal and formal feedback (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.28); a learning culture (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23); uncompromising, individual clinical leadership (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.23); explicit goals (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.17); and with the sum score (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.23) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several cultural characteristics of the hospital organization are related to thrombolysis rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Organizational culture may be an important target for interventions aimed at increasing rates of thrombolysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in hospitals </plain></SENT>
