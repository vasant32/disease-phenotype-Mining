<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in rats by injecting 150 mug of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> into the left internal carotid artery on day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic group, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was significantly decreased 6.5 h after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasudil (3 mg/kg/30 min i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>infusion) significantly increased rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The viscosity of whole blood was significantly increased 48 h after the injection of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasudil (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased blood viscosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To clarify the therapeutic time window of fasudil, rats received their first i.p. administration of fasudil (10 mg/kg) 6 h after an injection of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18262">laurate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Administration of fasudil twice daily was continued until day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fasudil prevented the accumulation of neutrophils within the brain as seen from measurements taken on day 3, and improved neuronal functions and reduced the infarction area as seen on day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fasudil and hydroxyfasudil, an active metabolite of fasudil, concentration-dependently inhibited phosphorylation of myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase in neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that inhibition of Rho-kinase activation with fasudil is effective for the treatment of ischemic brain damage with a wide therapeutic time window by improving hemodynamic function and preventing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that fasudil will be a novel and efficacious approach for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
