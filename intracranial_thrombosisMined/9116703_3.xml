<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by a point mutation in the gene coding for coagulation factor V, called FV:Q506 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterio-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> is a common and serious medical problem in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of the factor V mutation associated with APC resistance and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCLs) in an epidemiological cohort of 78 Swedish SLE patients, to determine their roles as risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, a detailed evaluation of the clinical manifestations in these patients was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Totally, 19 (24%) of the 78 SLE patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 11 (14%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and 8 (10%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by occlusion of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six (33%) SLE patients were aCL positive and 8 (10%) were heterozygous for the factor V mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and one of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> had the FV:Q506 mutation, whereas 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and 5 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were aCL positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve disease</z:e> were aCL positive, a statistically significant association (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we found no statistically significant association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and FV:Q506 mutation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> and aCL positivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was, however, an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018824" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart valve disease</z:e> and aCL positivity </plain></SENT>
