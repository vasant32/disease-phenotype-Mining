<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> is the most frequent symptom in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT), and usually the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has rarely been reported as the only symptom of CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the characteristics of patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was the only presentation of CVT in the absence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, or other intracranial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a prospective study of 123 consecutive patients with CVT only those with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain computed tomography (CT) scan and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent an extensive systematic aetiological work-up and were given intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> followed by oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A detailed description of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was only sign of CVT in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lateral sinus was the most frequently involved sinus (n = 15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was progressive in 11, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> in 3, and thunderclap in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Once established, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was continuous in 15, diffuse in four and unilateral in 13, usually ipsilateral to the occluded lateral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No specific risk factor or cause was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had a favourable evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The pathogenesis of isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in CVT in the absence of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, SAH, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> or intracerebral lesion is unknown but may involve changes in the walls of the occluded sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hence MRI/MRV should be used to look for signs of CVT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (progressive or thunderclap) even when the CT scan and CSF examination are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
