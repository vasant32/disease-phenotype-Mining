<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective two year study of patients over the age of 14 sent to the Neurology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the visit were classified into 15 categories and the diagnoses were given a code according to the criteria set out in the International Classification of Diseases 9th edition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2,227 patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of first visits was 10.6 per 1,000 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>60% of the patients were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age was 51.6 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most frequent reason for the visiting the doctor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One out of every three patients visited because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and/or facial pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The five most frequent diagnoses in the under 65 group were, in descending order of frequency: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>, tension type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The five most common diagnoses in the over 65 group were, in descending order of frequency: Alzheimer, Parkinson, transitory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The type of ambulatory neurological pathology depends on the age of the patients, and thus we find that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is prevalent in the younger patients whereas neurodegenerative and vascular pathological conditions are more common in those over the age of 65 </plain></SENT>
