<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was located in the primary somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After different survival times (1, 7 and 28 days) D1R binding levels were determined in the lesion core, penumbra, frontoparietal motor (FrPaM) and somatosensory (FrPaSS) areas as well as in homotopic regions in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, D1R density decreased by 36% (P &lt; 0.01) in the lesion core relative to sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7th day binding density was further reduced by 56% (P &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight days after infarction, D1R binding returned to control level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No alterations in D1R binding levels were found in penumbra and other investigated regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the return of D1R binding to control level in the area initially corresponding to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> results from the shrinkage of the lesion volume </plain></SENT>
