<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have established a novel guinea pig model with CFRs in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) using a photothrombotic technique, in which the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was spontaneously recanalized within 20 min after the first occlusion with subsequent CFRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the effects of antiplatelet agents and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> using this model </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results show that this model is unique with respect to its development of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cyclic flow reductions, and may be suitable for investigating mechanisms and therapeutic reagents of CFRs in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
