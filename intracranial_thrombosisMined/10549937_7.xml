<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To address the several disadvantages of currently available ultrasonic aspirators used in microsurgery, new instruments were designed for neurosurgical use under a microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESCRIPTION OF INSTRUMENTATION: The weight of the handpiece was reduced to 90 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two types of angled probes were constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Keyhole-type probes have 93- and 112-mm lengths, a 2.2-mm tip diameter, and 9.5- and 11.2-mm sheath diameters at the most proximal site and produce a tip amplitude of 300 microm (supplied by 23.5-kHz ultrasonic power) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Needle-type probes have 89- and 171-mm lengths, a 1.9-mm tip diameter, and 3.5- and 3.3-mm sheath diameters at the proximal site and produce a tip amplitude of 70 microm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these instruments are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The newly developed handpiece and probes were used in an experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 119 mass lesions treated included giant thrombosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, various <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>gliomas</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>vestibular schwannomas</z:hpo>, deep-seated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, clival <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and suprasellar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS: The handpiece and probes were safely used in regions that are difficult to access, such as the third ventricle and the cerebellopontine angle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was possible to manipulate the needle-type probe in the suprasellar region through the transsphenoidal route, and the probe was very efficient for thrombectomy in giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonic power of keyhole-type probes was sufficient to remove <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This newly developed neurosurgical handpiece with angled probes has great utility for microscopic dissections, because of its small size and light weight </plain></SENT>
