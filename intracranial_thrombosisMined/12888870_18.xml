<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is likely related to an acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since a primary prophylaxis using antithrombin concentrates may prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, the PARKAA (Prophylactic Antithrombin replacement in kids with ALL treated with L-asparaginase) study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of PARKAA were to determine if there was a trend to efficacy and safety of antithrombin treatment as assessed by 1) incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> 2) incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and 3) plasma markers of endogenous thrombin generation as surrogate outcomes for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study was not powered to answer the question of efficacy and safety, but rather to detect a trend </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARKAA was an open, randomised, controlled study in children with ALL being treated with ASP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children were randomised to receive antithrombin infusions or no antithrombin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> thrombotic events were confirmed using bilateral venography, ultrasound, echocardiography and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in patients treated with antithrombin was 28% (95% CI 10-46%), compared to 37% (95% CI 24-49%) in the non treated arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two minor bleeds occurred in patients in the treated arm, but were not considered to be related to antithrombin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were seen in plasma markers by the treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, treatment with antithrombin concentrate shows a trend to efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no difference in surrogate markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Carefully designed clinical trials are needed to test the efficacy and safety of antithrombin in this population </plain></SENT>
