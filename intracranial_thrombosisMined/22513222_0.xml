<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five primary APS patients, 4 women, mean age 45.1 years (range 31-76 years), were considered eligible for IVIG therapy due to relapsing thrombotic events (4 recurrent venous thromboses, 2 ischaemic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolisms</z:hpo>, 1 thrombotic event on the vena cava filter), despite conventional therapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had anti-nuclear antibodies at low-medium titre without other signs or symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IVIG was combined with hydroxychloroquine and, in patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three consecutive daily infusions of IVIG were administered intravenously at a dose of 0.4 g/kg/day every month for 3 months, followed by a single monthly infusion for 9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No further thromboses occurred in the 5 treated patients (mean follow-up 89.2 months, range 61-114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Visual analogue score (VAS 0-10) improved (mean 3.5, range 3.0-5.0, before, and 7.35, range 9.9-6.0, p= 0.05) after IVIG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a long-term (&gt;5 years) open study in a small cohort of high risk primary APS patients, IVIG was found to be effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Full understanding of the mechanisms and efficacy, as well as the optimal doses of IVIG in APS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004419'>recurrent thrombosis</z:hpo>, will require appropriately designed clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Presently, IVIG use is restricted by costs and limited availability </plain></SENT>
