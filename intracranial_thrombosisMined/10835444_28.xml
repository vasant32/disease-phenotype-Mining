<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project were analyzed for the years 1993 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Observed values were weighted with poststratification discharge weights to project to the universe of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discharges from community hospitals located in the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nationally representative estimates of risk were calculated on the basis of age, race, mode of delivery, income, third-party payer, hospital size, hospital ownership, hospital location (rural versus urban), hospital teaching status, census region, and presence of specific complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate models were developed with the use of logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 1 408 015 sampled deliveries, there were 183 observed cases of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 170 cases of peripartum intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in 17 states in the United States in 1993 and 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were an estimated 975 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 864 cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during pregnancy and the puerperium in the United States among 7 463 712 deliveries during 1993 and 1994, for estimated risks of 13.1 cases of peripartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 11.6 cases of peripartum intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> per 100 000 deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the following were strongly and significantly associated with both peripartum and postpartum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: cesarean delivery; fluid, electrolyte, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acid-base disorders</z:e>; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Covariates that were strongly and significantly associated with both peripartum and postpartum intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> included cesarean delivery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1560945" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections other</z:e> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021400" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FLU">influenza</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and cesarean delivery are important risk factors for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
