<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracisternal administration of thrombolytic agents to dissolve subarachnoid clots may be responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and safety of cisternal irrigation therapy using low-dose tissue plasminogen activator were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty patients with SAH were treated by surgical clipping, and randomly divided into three groups: 1) the control group (n = 20) treated only with baseline treatment; 2) the intermittent group (n = 20) received intermittent administration of clotlysis agent (tisokinase 960,000 IU); and 3) the continuous group (n = 20) received continuous irrigation using pH-adjusted <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> Ringer's solution containing tisokinase (96 IU/mL) infused at 20 mL/hr for 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clearance of subarachnoid clots was measured by laboratory examinations and postoperative computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>-related vasospasm was evaluated by neurological status and computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological outcome was evaluated by the modified Rankin scale at 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subarachnoid clot was efficiently and significantly removed without major complication in the intermittent and continuous groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ischemic lesion in the intermittent group was significantly lower than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The intermittent group had significantly better neurological outcome than the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cisternal irrigation therapy using low-dose tissue plasminogen activator is effective and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intermittent injection is most effective and may decrease the risk of symptomatic vasospasm in patients with SAH </plain></SENT>
