<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>New fast neuroimaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) are sensitive to different reasons of changes in local tissular water concentration thus giving further insight into the pathophysiological mechanism as well as prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the cases of 18 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> based on clinical and imaging criteria </plain></SENT>
