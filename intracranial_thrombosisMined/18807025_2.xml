<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation and assesses the efficacy and safety of abciximab for clot dissolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with abciximab during (41 patients) or shortly after (22 patients) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> coil embolisation were retrieved from the institutional database (2000 to 2007, 1,250 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients (mean age, 55.3 years, +/- 12.8) had received either intra-arterial or intravenous abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for clot formation were assessed and the angiographic and clinical outcome evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture occurred during or after abciximab application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intra-procedural rate of total recanalisation was 68.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thromboembolic complications were frequently found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the Acom complex and of the basilar artery, whilst internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were underrepresented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of treatment-related intracranial haemorrhages into preexisting cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed a symptomatic groin haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abciximab is efficacious and safe for thrombolysis during and after endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment in the absence of preexisting ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
