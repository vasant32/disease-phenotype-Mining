<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CSF GOT and LDH activities were well correlated with the severity, mortality and peak and proper timing in relation to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, same is about serum GOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A characteristic rise of GOT and LDH was observed in cerebral haemorrhage especially in fatal cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and embolism specially in non-fatal cases, the enzyme change was not so marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GOT and LDH enzyme pattern in CSF and serum may, therefore, serve as an early, relatively easy and widely available tool for differential diagnosis and prognosis of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
