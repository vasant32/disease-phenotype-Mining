<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we investigated the mechanism responsible for Lu/BCAM phosphorylation in the presence of JAK2V617F using HEL and BaF3 cell lines as well as RBCs from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High levels of Rap1-<z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> were found in HEL and BaF3 cells expressing JAK2V617F compared with BaF3 cells with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> JAK2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding was associated with increased Akt activity, Lu/BCAM phosphorylation, and cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to laminin that were inhibited by the dominant-negative Rap1S17N or by the specific Rap1 inhibitor GGTI-298 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, knocking-down EpoR in HEL cells did not alter Akt activity or cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to laminin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings reveal a novel EpoR-independent Rap1/Akt signaling pathway that is activated by JAK2V617F in circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> RBCs and responsible for Lu/BCAM activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This new characteristic of JAK2V617F could play a critical role in initiating abnormal interactions among circulating and endothelial cells in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> </plain></SENT>
