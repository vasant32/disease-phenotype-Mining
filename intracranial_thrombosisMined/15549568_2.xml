<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> represents the major clinical manifestation at presentation we focused our attention on this symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the preliminary results of a prospective multicentric study that includes cases diagnosed as CVT in the participating centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have so far studied 35 patients (5 males and 30 females) from the ages of 18 to 78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent manifestation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (77.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was more frequently localised (66.7%) and continuous (77.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pain was mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> (38.5%-50.0%) and the intensity moderate-severe (37.0%-51.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, we found a positive correlation between CVT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (p=0.001) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These preliminary results seem in accordance with our previous findings in the retrospective study, suggesting that CVT is more often associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> of severe intensity </plain></SENT>
