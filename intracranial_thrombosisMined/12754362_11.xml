<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied the relapse rate of CVST and the incidence of extracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> during subsequent pregnancies in 39 women (from 125 patients with CVST) who suffered a CVST at childbearing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean follow up was 10.25 years (range 1 to 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty two pregnancies and 19 births were observed in 14 women without evidence of either recurrence of CVST or extracerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One pregnancy occurred during oral anticoagulation and was interrupted and two pregnancies ended with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> had been given during five pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of recurrence for CVST during pregnancy seems to be low and these data do not justify a negative advice on pregnancy in women with previous CVST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to evaluate the need for a prophylactic anticoagulation during pregnancy and puerperium </plain></SENT>
