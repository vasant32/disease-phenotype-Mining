<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors evaluated the efficacy of a new flow reduction strategy for giant partially thrombosed upper basilar artery (BA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, for which proximal parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is not always effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight consecutive patients with severely symptomatic, partially thrombosed, giant upper BA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with a tailored flow reduction strategy, or received conservative therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The flow reduction strategy comprised isolation of several branches from the upper BA at their origins with bypasses in addition to parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median follow-up period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients was 15.0 months (range 4-31 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients treated with flow reduction, the mean decrease in residual blood lumen was -10.7 mm (95% CI -19.7 to -1.7 mm; p = 0.029) and the mean decrease in diameter of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was -11.5 mm (95% CI -25.1 to 2.1 mm; p = 0.082) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete or virtually complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (83%) and shrinkage was observed in 4 (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In those in whom complete or virtually complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was achieved, significant shrinkage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was observed (mean decrease in diameter -14.8 mm; 95% CI -28.8 to -0.8 mm; p = 0.043) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Improvement or stabilization of symptoms occurred in 67% of the patients who received flow reduction treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients who received conservative treatment had unfavorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The flow reduction strategy is effective at promoting complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This strategy can also induce shrinkage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> if successful <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the neurological outcome of the treatment appears favorable considering its intractable nature, further study of the treatment is necessary to confirm its clinical efficacy and safety </plain></SENT>
