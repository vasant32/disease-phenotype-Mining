<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>If diagnosed early, treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Often it may present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as the only complaint, and thus the diagnosis is likely to be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A medically stable 31-year-old male, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> smoker with a âˆ¼17 pack-year history of smoking, was admitted to the emergency room with a 2-week history of gradually worsening, severe, throbbing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in the occipital region sensitive to light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial neurological examination was positive only for some involuntary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100034'>motor tics</z:hpo> of the left leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial laboratory workup showed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> of 20 g/dl and hematocrit of 56.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The carboxyhemoglobin level was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the oxygen dissociation curve was shifted to the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation by MRI and MRA of the brain suggested extensive and complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the superior sagittal sinus, right transverse sinus and right sigmoid sinus with a small venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the right parafrontal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given that the patient first presented with a thrombotic event, workup for primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> and hypercoagulable disorders was carried out, including JAK2 mutation evaluation, which was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This left us with smoking as the only risk factor and possible cause for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>He improved significantly with phlebotomy and anticoagulation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates a rare but severe complication of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> stressing the importance of being aware of the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> smoking exposure </plain></SENT>
