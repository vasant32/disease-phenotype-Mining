<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro, platelet aggregation is induced by many different agents; which of these is responsible for aggregation in vivo is now under investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we have developed novel techniques for the reproducible determination of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times in mesenteric arterioles of rats and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Local infusions of enzyme systems which remove <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>) greatly increase the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time at arterial injuries distal to the site of infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations establish the involvement of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> in the activation of platelets for primary hemostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct measurement of free <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), as an indicator of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, at such injury sites indicates that enough <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> for activating platelets is released very rapidly from damaged vessel walls and much later from the platelets themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-time technique has also shown that hemostatic platelet aggregation is delayed less by the inhibition of the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> than by that of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations provide an explanation for the ineffectiveness of any simple platelet-inhibiting drug (including aspirin) by itself, whenever arterial (e.g., coronary or cerebral) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is initiated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> into atheromatous plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, aspirin is significantly effective when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> follows unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> and when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> follow transient episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This partial effectiveness can be explained by an action of aspirin on platelets, assuming that, in such cases, their thromboembolic aggregation is initiated by hemodynamic effects of atheromatous lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
