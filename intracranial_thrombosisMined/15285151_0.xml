<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Authors describe the robotic physiotherapy system developed in the scope of Reharob project belonging to the 5th Framework Programme of the European Union </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The system is able to execute robot mediated physiotherapy of the shoulder and the elbow of patients with spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the fact, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> is velocity dependent, it is important to execute the exercises with a relatively slow and constant velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In such cases a robot can support the work of the physiotherapist first of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> when delivering exercises with high repetition number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The objective of the first clinical trial was to gain experiences with the system, to prove its functionality and security </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 4 healthy subjects and 8 patients with spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were given 30 minutes long robot mediated physiotherapy on 20 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 240 therapeutic events the robots executed the exercises according to the programme established by the physiotherapist, without any significant mechanical problem or dangerous situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical trial confirmed the functionality of the Reharob Therapeutic System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of the system will be continued according to the experiences gained during the trial </plain></SENT>
