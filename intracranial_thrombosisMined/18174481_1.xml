<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perilipin is encoded by the gene PLIN and mediates <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its upregulation has been linked to the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo>, rupture of atherosclerotic plaques, and perhaps <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genetic variations in PLIN might contribute to the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was tested in 2 case-control studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six PLIN tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7176403, rs8179078, rs6496589, rs8179043, rs894160, rs1052700) were genotyped in 1571 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (690 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 429 lacunar infarction, 452 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>) and 1638 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A SHEsis software platform was used to analyze pairwise linkage disequilibrium and haplotype association in the case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study was replicated in another independent case-control study including 120 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 240 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No association of the PLIN variants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P&gt;0.05) or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes (P&gt;0.05) was found in the first study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings were confirmed in the second population (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data represent an important negative finding that the common variants of PLIN do not have a major effect on susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a Chinese population </plain></SENT>
