<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the beta-amyloid <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (Abeta) is a critical factor in this disease, we examined its relationship to fibrin clot formation in AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that fibrin clots formed in the presence of Abeta are structurally abnormal and resistant to degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrin(ogen) was observed in blood vessels positive for amyloid in mouse and human AD samples, and intravital brain imaging of clot formation and dissolution revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001977'>abnormal thrombosis</z:hpo> and fibrinolysis in AD mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of fibrinogen lessened <z:hpo ids='HP_0011970'>cerebral amyloid angiopathy</z:hpo> pathology and reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in AD mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These experiments suggest that one important contribution of Abeta to AD is via its effects on fibrin clots, implicating fibrin(ogen) as a potential critical factor in this disease </plain></SENT>
