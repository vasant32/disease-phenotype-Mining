<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort of 23,796 consecutive autopsies, performed using a standardized procedure and representing 84% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> between 1970 and 1982 in an urban Swedish population, we investigated the relationship between verified <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> and VTE, with the hypothesis that patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in major artery segments have increased odds of VTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found an increased risk of VTE in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> (Odds ratio; OR adjusted for gender and age 1.4, 95% confidence interval; CI 1.3-1.5) (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with cervico-cranial and peripheral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> had an excess risk even when controlling for age and major concomitant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A negative association between coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and VTE in the univariate analysis (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6-0.8) (P &lt; 0.001), was less pronounced in the multivariate analysis (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-1.0) (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between atherothrombosis and VTE was confirmed, except in patients with coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, where <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> as competing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> cause is a possible confounder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate a potential for directed prevention, but may also imply similarities in etiology </plain></SENT>
