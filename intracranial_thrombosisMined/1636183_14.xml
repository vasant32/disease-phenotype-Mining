<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Platelet-activating factor is a potent bioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16247">phospholipid</z:chebi> and may play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the inactivation of this autacoid in plasma, we measured platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in plasma low density and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Low density and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> were separated by ultracentrifugation from plasma of 33 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo> and 31 age-matched healthy control subjects, and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in each fraction was assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The average values of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> from patients and control subjects were 41 +/- 18 and 29 +/- 17 nmol/ml per minute, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01 U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in activity in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> between the two groups (16 +/- 11 versus 14 +/- 9 nmol/ml per minute, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increased plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is primarily attributable to the increased binding to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and this increase may be an adaptation to the augmented generation of platelet-activating factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
