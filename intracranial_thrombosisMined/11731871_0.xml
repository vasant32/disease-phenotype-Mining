<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> presenting with intracerebral haemorrhage in which cerebral angiography showed a lesion mimicking pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the patient needed urgent surgical decompression, it was delayed because early haematoma evacuation would induce rebleeding from the rupture site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors attempted to occlude the pseudoaneurysm interventionally before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgical excision, the lesion that was believed to be a pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was revealed as a partially thrombosed venous sac having a thick fibrous wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, the authors discuss the pitfalls in the interpretation of pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in angiographic <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> architecture </plain></SENT>
