<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because no approach or device can be optimal for every patient, it is desirable to have options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case is the first report on a novel retrieval device which proved to be very effective in our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old woman with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was excluded from treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator because of an elevated international normalized ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: We successfully treated this patient endovascularly using a device newly approved by the Food and Drug Administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We achieved rapid recanalization and an excellent clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Using a new retrieval device, we were able to rapidly and successfully treat an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in a patient not eligible for intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may offer another alternative in endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
