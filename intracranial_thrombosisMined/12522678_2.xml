<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) in which the only risk factor we were able to identify was increased blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels and the C677T polymorphism in both alleles of the <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">methylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="20506,26907">tetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase MTHFR gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e> should also be a risk factor for CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since this condition can be effectively and safely corrected by drugs, we suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels should be routinely determined in patients with idiopatic CVT, and even mildly increased levels corrected pharmacologically, in the hope of reducing the risks associated with this condition </plain></SENT>
