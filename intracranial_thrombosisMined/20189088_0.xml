<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mechanical thrombectomy can restore blood flow to the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, but may be associated with risks, such as breakage of moving parts and clot fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> device (ATD), the GP ATD, which has no moving parts and extracts clots by suction in a vortex flow pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The GP ATD is used to extract porcine blood clots inserted into the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) of a model of the circle of Willis, and from porcine aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The GP ATD is navigable around the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> angles of the circle of Willis model and successfully extracts clots that cause complete occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a strong correlation between the pressure required for clot extraction (mean 31.8, range 30-34 kPa) and its mass (mean 0.08, range 0.03-0.13 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete clot extraction can be demonstrated by computed tomography scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lysis of a 0.15-g <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> using alteplase at a concentration of 3.4 microg/mL was more effective when delivered and extracted via the GP ATD than via a catheter without the GP ATD or delivered systemically in our circle of Willis model and extracted without suction (clot mass after extraction 0.07, 0.09, and 0.11 g, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination does not show evidence of damage of the arterial wall caused by clot extraction at suction pressures of up to 30 kPa via the GP ATD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The GP ATD appears to effectively extract blood clots from models of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> without significant clot fragmentation and damage to the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further experiments using arteries in situ are required to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
