<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have provided convincing evidence that psychosocial factors, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress and emotional factors are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independent predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cardiovascular events as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, psychosocial factors have received little attention in the medical setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of stress on photothrombotic ischemic cortical injury in an animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to the four groups and cortical photothrombosis was induced in the sensorimotor cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stress groups were subjected to restraint stress for five days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the behavioral function, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and the activations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPK: Erk1/Erk2, and p38MAPK) for the evaluation of stress effects on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant increase in cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group subjected to restraint stress (p&lt;0.05, and p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional recovery was worst in restraint stress group during five days (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activation of Erk1 and Erk2 were increased by restraint stress in sham operation group but decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-stress group than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> control group (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The activation of p38MAPK was increased by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but this effect was decreased by restraint stress (p&lt;0.05, and p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrates that restraint stress increases infarction volume and decreases functional recovery in rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> models by modulation of the MAPK pathway </plain></SENT>
