<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 26 patients (21 females) and 217 healthy controls (134 females) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the three mutations in cases and controls were: PT 20210A, 23 versus 1%, odds ratio (OR) 21.40 (95% CI 4.29-118.75), p &lt; 0.001; FV 1691A, 8 versus 1%, OR 5.94 (95% CI 0.66-46.9); MTHFR 677TT, 4 versus 7%, OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.03-4.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OC use was more frequent in female patients over 14 years old than in controls (84 vs. 40%, OR 8.15, 95% CI 2.09-37.13, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model that best explained the thrombotic risk included PT 20210A and OC use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PT 20210A and OC use are the main thrombophilic risk factors predisposing to CVT and should be routinely investigated in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
