<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between the 2 factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Chinese in a large case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited 1823 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (807 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 513 lacunar infarction, 503 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>) and 1832 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C677T polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and HinfI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels were significantly higher in cases than controls (median, 14.7 versus 12.8 micromol/L; P&lt;0.001) and associated with an increased risk of 1.87-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58 to 2.22) for overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1.72-fold (95% CI, 1.39 to 2.12) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, 1.89-fold (95% CI, 1.50 to 2.40) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, and 1.94-fold (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.55) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C677T mutation of the MTHFR gene was positively correlated with plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels in both controls (beta=0.250, P&lt;0.001) and cases (beta=0.272, P&lt;0.001) and more frequently in cases than in controls (47.0% versus 44.2%, P=0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The TT genotype was associated with an increased risk for overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.56) and thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene was associated with increased risk of cerebral thrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was correlated with both ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, suggesting potential initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>-lowering therapy in this population </plain></SENT>
