<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> to ischaemic damage by carefully depicting the temporal and spatial neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, rats were subjected to chemical photothrombosis, and histological and biochemical analyses were performed over a period of 24 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effects of the lipophilic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30351">2,2'-dipyridyl</z:chebi> (DP) were evaluated 24 h after photothrombosis when the lesion volume was maximal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed two separate waves of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first wave, shrunken dark neurons were massively present as early as 2 h after photothrombosis in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From this initial neuronal abnormal population, progressive and time-dependent changes of both necrotic and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were observed, leading to ghost neurons and apoptotic bodies after 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extension of the lesion coincided with a second wave of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Massive and rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> occurred at the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border, which appeared as a sharply demarcated pale region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Procaspase and poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) cleavages were also detected in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and surrounding damaged tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DP treatment markedly blocked the enlargement of the lesion, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> border being rescued from infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a large decrease of apoptotic bodies was associated with a significant drop of caspase and PARP-1 cleavages, suggesting that the protective effect of DP closely correlates with limitation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> expansion </plain></SENT>
