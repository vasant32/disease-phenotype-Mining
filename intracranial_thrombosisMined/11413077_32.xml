<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial recanalization precedes clinical improvement or may lead to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Speed of clot lysis was not previously measured in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) were used to monitor consecutive patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), before tPA bolus and at 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete or partial recanalization of the middle cerebral or basilar artery on TCD were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was classified a priori as sudden (abrupt appearance of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or stenotic low-resistance signal), stepwise (flow improvement over 1 to 29 minutes), or slow (&gt;/=30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was documented in 43 tPA-treated patients (age 68+/-17 years; NIHSS score 16.8+/-6, median 15 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>tPA bolus was given at a mean of 135+/-61 minutes after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recanalization began at a median of 17 minutes and was completed at 35 minutes after tPA bolus, with mean duration of recanalization of 23+/-16 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was sudden in 5, stepwise in 23, and slow in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Faster recanalization predicted better short-term improvement (P=0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, 80%, 30%, and 13% of patients in these respective recanalization groups had NIHSS scores of 0 to 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in only 1 patient, who had stepwise recanalization 5.5 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Slow or partial recanalization with dampened flow signal was found in 53% of patients with total NIHSS scores &gt;10 points at 24 hours (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization (n=25) occurred faster (median 10 minutes) than partial recanalization (n=18; median 30 minutes; P=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rapid arterial recanalization is associated with better short-term improvement, mostly likely because of faster and more complete clot breakup with low resistance of the distal circulatory bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Slow (&gt;/=30 minutes) flow improvement and dampened flow signal are less favorable prognostic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings may be evaluated to assist with selection of patients for additional pharmacological or interventional treatment </plain></SENT>
