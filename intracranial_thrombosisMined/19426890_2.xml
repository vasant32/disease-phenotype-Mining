<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The majority of survivors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) regain functional independence, but it is unclear whether these patients experience long-term sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this case-control study was to assess: (1) frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and concentration impairment; and (2) impact of these sequelae on daily life and employment in patients with CVT who are functionally independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 44 patients with CVT older than 15 years diagnosed between January 1997 and July 2006 who were functionally independent (modified Rankin scale score &lt;or= 2) at least 12 months after CVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Healthy control subjects were matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was assessed by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> Impact Test, <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> Severity Scale, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> by the Center for Epidemiological Studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> Scale, and concentration impairment with the cognition dimension of the 6-dimensional EuroQol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied the psychosocial impact (based on the Severity Impact Profile 68) and the impact on employment status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up was 63 months (range 12-124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 33 patients (75%) reported concentration impairment, 19 (43%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 13 (30%) were depressive, and 13 (30%) experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sequelae were more reported by patients than control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The sequelae were correlated with each other, and with a higher psychosocial impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Working was impossible for 8 (21%) and difficult for 13 (34%) of previously employed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this case-control study, patients with CVT classified as having a good (independent) outcome often experience long-term symptoms that have a negative impact on their psychosocial and employment status </plain></SENT>
