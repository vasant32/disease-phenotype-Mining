<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred and one patients below 45 years and showing objective signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were studied retrospectively for pathogenic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve were below 15 years; the male to female ratio was 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors known as predisposing (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>hyperlipemia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e>) and other possible factors (e.g. trauma, abuse) were found in 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among women using contraceptive pills there might be an increased risk of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, but the material was not large enough to warrant statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 64 patients one or more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">abnormal coagulation</z:e> values were found, the most frequent being a deficient vessel wall fibrinolysis, which was noted in 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore consider it worthwhile to investigate the fibrinolytic defence mechanism of the vessel wall in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral thrombosis</z:hpo>, since it is possible to treat this condition with specific fibrinolytic stimulating agents </plain></SENT>
