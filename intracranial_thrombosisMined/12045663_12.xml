<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> model of the rat to characterize intracranial vessel occlusion patterns and to test its predictive power for tissue recovery after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After rt-PA-treated selective middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion, full recanalization was observed in two of three animals, whereas additional occlusion of the circle of Willis (CW) resulted in full vascular flow restitution in only one of six rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue reperfusion markedly lagged the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of treatment, and the delay correlated with the pattern of vessel occlusion (20 to 23 minutes for selective <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion vs. 71 to 79 minutes for combined <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/CW occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In lateral cortex and striatum the apparent diffusion coefficient decreased to 78 +/- 15% of control after embolization, recovered to 80% to 85% after rt-PA treatment of selective <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, but further declined to 66% to 69% after combined <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/CW occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, T2 relaxation time increased to 107% to 118% of control after selective <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and to 112% to 124% after combined <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>/CW occlusion in these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present investigation shows that MRA provides valuable information on the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> and has the power to predict, before the initiation of treatment, the functional tissue outcome after rt-PA-induced thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
