<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic activity in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid was assessed before treatment, one week later and two weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural history of fibrinolysis following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> was obtained from analysis of the placebo group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo>, fibrin degradation products and plasminogen activity in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, fibrin degradation products in the cerebrospinal fluid fell progressively over the following 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
