<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision coding system at 10 centers in the United States during a 10-year period by retrospective chart review (1991-1997) or prospective enrollment (1997-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 232 patients were screened for study inclusion and 182 of these patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age range was 13 to 82 years (mean 38 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0398623" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hypercoagulable state</z:e> was the most common predisposing factor followed by pregnancy, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002160'>homocystinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic examination revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings in 69 patients (38%); 37 (20%) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e>, 59 (32%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo>, and 71 (39%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 61 patients (33%) had evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> by computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 patients (15%) were treated with thrombolysis and 124 (68%) with anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall mortality was 13% (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One-year follow up was available for 96 patients (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these, 26 (27%) were healthy, 43 (45%) were ambulatory with assistance, and 27 (28%) were still bedridden </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On multivariate analysis, the best predictors of a poor outcome were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> at presentation (odds ratio 15.2 [95% confidence interval; 1.5-66]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (odds ratio 8.7 [95% confidence interval; 1.3-34.5]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical and radiologic presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> in the United States is not much different from other parts of world but spectrum and frequency of predisposing factors are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Number of patients treated with thrombolysis is higher as compared with other reported series of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> at presentation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> were the strongest predictors of poor outcome, which is comparable with other series </plain></SENT>
