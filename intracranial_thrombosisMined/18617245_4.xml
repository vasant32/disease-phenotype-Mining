<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>) is an alternative surgical strategy for complex internal carotid artery (ICA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which are unclippable because of their anatomical structures, including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000475'>broad neck</z:hpo>, fragile dome, critical branch, and cavernous sinus location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite revascularization, ischemic complications occur after the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> because of several factors, such as hypoperfusion, embolism, and perforator impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> ischemic complications and their mechanisms were analyzed in a consecutive series of 32 patients presenting with complex ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen ruptured and 18 unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located in the cavernous sinus (n = 16) and paraclinoid portion (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative balloon test occlusion was performed to investigate ischemic tolerance and to select the bypass method in 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An extracranial-intracranial bypass was constructed using the superficial temporal artery in 17, and a saphenous vein graft was done in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although postoperative hypoperfusion was prevented by revascularization based on the balloon test occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic complications due to perforator occlusion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> were observed in 10 cases after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five cases presented with impairment of perforating branches adjacent to the occluded parent artery, resulting in prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distal location of ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is a risk factor for the perforator impairment, when treated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53240">PAO</z:chebi> by clip placement is preferred to endovascular coiling to prevent of perforator impairment </plain></SENT>
