<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 2 (GLP-2) has been shown to improve intestinal absorption in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036992" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">short bowel syndrome</z:e> (SBS) patients in a short-term study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes safety, compliance, and changes in quality of life in 11 SBS patients at baseline, week 13, 26, and 52 during two years of subcutaneous GLP-2 treatment, 400 microgram TID, intermitted by an 8-week washout period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Safety and compliance was evaluated during the admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), Short Form 36 (SF 36), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> Questionnaire (IBDQ) evaluated quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The predominant adverse event was transient abdominal discomfort in 5 of 11 patients, but in 2, both suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohns disease</z:e>, it progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and led to discontinuation of GLP-2 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One had a fibrostenotic lesion electively resected at the jejuno-ascendo-anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The investigator excluded a patient due to unreliable feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stoma nipple enlargement was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 jejunostomy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reported GLP-2 compliance was excellent (&gt;93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>GLP-2 improved the overall quality of life VAS-score (4.1 +/- 2.8 cm versus 6.0 +/- 2.4 cm, P &lt; .01), the overall SIP score (10.3 +/- 8.9% versus 6.2 +/- 9.5%, P &lt; .001), the mental component of the SF-36 (45 +/- 13% versus 53 +/- 11%, P &lt; .05), and the overall IBDQ score (5.1 +/- 0.9 versus 5.4 +/- 0.9, P &lt; .007) in the 8 patients completing the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with GLP-2 is feasible in SBS patients, although caution must be exercised in patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although conclusions cannot be made in a noncontrolled trial, the high reported compliance might reflect a high treatment satisfaction, where the clinical benefits of GLP-2 may outweigh the discomforts of injections </plain></SENT>
