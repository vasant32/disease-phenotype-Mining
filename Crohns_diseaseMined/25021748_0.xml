<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The rising incidence of IBD, young <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> nature mean that IBD has significant cost implications with the National IBD Audit estimating that cost to the National Health Service (NHS) exceeded £1 billion in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recent introduction of Clinical Commissioning Groups has also changed the way in which healthcare is paid for </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This model is designed to be used by both commissioners and individual gastroenterology units to calculate the annual cost per patient of treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> (UC) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010346" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Crohns Disease</z:e> (CD) and to enable areas of potential cost savings to be explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The cost of care for IBD was calculated by summing the costs of treatment, treatment side effects and disease-related complications, accounting for the proportions of patients incurring these costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Default input values for costs, the percentage of patients receiving each treatment, and the percentage of patients experiencing side effects or complications were determined from sources such as the British National Formulary (BNF), National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), NHS trusts and published literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, an important feature of the model was its customisability allowing users to input local data, thereby generating costs which were unique and precise for that unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using default input values, the annual cost of treating any UC patient was estimated to be £3,084 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For a UC patient in remission, in relapse with mild-to-moderate UC or in relapse with severe UC, annual cost per patient was estimated to be £1,693, £2,903 and £10,760, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The annual cost for any CD patient was estimated to be £6,156 (£1,800 for patients in remission; £10,513 for patients in relapse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, inputting local data would show some variability in the costs from trust to trust </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Annually £743.65 was spent per UC patient on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazines</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The model allows exploration of the cost savings if the percentage of patients on each brand of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> was altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the percentage of relapsing CD patients on adalimumab was increased from 5% to 10%, the annual cost per relapsing CD patient rose from ��10,513 to £11,032 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The overall annual cost for any CD patient rose from £6,156 to £6,416 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Increasing the percentage of mild-to-moderate UC patients on leukapheresis from 0.5 to 8% increased the annual cost per mild-to-moderate patient from £2,903 to £3,352, and the annual cost for any UC patient from £3,083 to £3,263 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, assuming that increased use of leukapheresis would cause a decrease from 20% to 15% in the annual proportion of patients experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe flares, the annual cost for any UC patient fell to £3,078 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This model facilitates calculation of local annual costs per UC and CD patient, and allows areas to be identified where savings could be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST: None Declared </plain></SENT>
