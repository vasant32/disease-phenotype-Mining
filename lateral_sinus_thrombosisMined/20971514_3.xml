<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to define the clinical and bacteriological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> (AM) in children in order to optimize diagnostic work-up and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, 188 children between 3 months and 15 years of age (15±24 months; median±SD) were referred to our pediatric ENT emergency center for AM during a 7-year period (December 2001-January 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty seven percent were male and 43% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up duration was 3.9±0.7 months (mean±<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of AM remained stable during the whole study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microbiological samples (n=236) were negative in 33% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently isolated germs were Streptococcus pneumoniae (51%), Streptococcus pyogenes (11.5%), Anaerobes (6.5%), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paracentesis, puncture of retro auricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> under local anesthesia, and peroperative samples <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> contributed to isolate the involved germ(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics, and 36.2% (n=68) underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several surgical procedures were necessary in 4 cases (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>AM recurrences requiring a second hospitalization were observed in 8 patients (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only observed complication was lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n=6; 3.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical failures, requiring more than one surgical procedure, were more frequent in case of: (i) presence of Anaerobes (p≤0.001) or <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> bacteria (p≤0.05) in microbiological samples; (ii) surgical drainage without mastoidectomy (p≤0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrences were more frequent in AM due to Streptococcus pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings and on literature data, a protocol was established in order to standardize the management of pediatric AM in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mains points are: no systematic surgery; if surgery is indicated, it must encompass a mastoidectomy; broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic treatment covering the most commonly involved germs (3rd generation <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23066">cephalosporin</z:chebi>) and secondarily adapted to the results of microbiological samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>If the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is not controlled after 48 h of intravenous antibiotherapy, a mastoidectomy had to be performed </plain></SENT>
