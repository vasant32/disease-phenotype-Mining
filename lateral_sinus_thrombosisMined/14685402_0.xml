<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, a review of the international literature about both complications is carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 7 year-old white male patient was referred for assessment with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, obnubilation, cervical mass and otorrhea, being non-responsive to the clinic treatment, with the diagnostic hypothesis of infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011850'>parotitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical examination and radiologic study demonstrated lateral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and cervical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> in the right ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After being submitted to surgery and prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient presented a favorable outcome, with little morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the incidence of complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029877" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">otitis</z:e> had decreased in the last decades, they are still a challenge for the clinician, especially because of the insidious manner of presentation, usually hidden with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
