<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 20-year-old woman, was treated with asparaginase for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She lapsed into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> with extensor posturing due to superior sagittal and right transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She recovered completely after local thrombolysis with 2,940,000 units urokinase, administered over a period of 40 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second patient was a 29-year-old man who presented with clinical deterioration after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> due to superior sagittal, left transverse and straight sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the risk of haemorrhage during thrombolysis with urokinase was considered to be high, mechanical thrombosuction with a hydrolyser catheter was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This procedure took only 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient recovered completely in two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases add further evidence to the effectiveness of thrombolysis and thrombosuction in selected patients with severe cerebral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
