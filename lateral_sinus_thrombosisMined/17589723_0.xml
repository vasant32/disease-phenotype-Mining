<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: Clinical aspects and treatment were reported based on our experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six cases of OLST were treated in our institution in the last ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging data were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients had the lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> detected during image evaluation for other symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> (COM) complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> were the main clinical manifestation related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We could not identify, in any case, specific features of lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases a mastoidectomy was associated with large spectrum antibiotics maintained for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In three cases anticoagulation therapy was introduced and in three cases anticoagulation was not indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases presented a good clinical evolution, without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OLST is almost always associated with other complications of COM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is diagnosed almost by accident during the investigative image study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We believe such disease is underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our experience, OLST presents a benign course, and mastoidectomy with antibiotics is the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
