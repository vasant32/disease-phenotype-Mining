<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can have nonspecific clinical and radiographic signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the novel "sigmoid notch sign" (on head CT) can help differentiate transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from a congenitally atretic sinus among individuals with absent signal in 1 transverse sinus by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 53 subjects with a unilaterally absent transverse sinus signal on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven had true transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and 42 had an atretic transverse sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reviewers were trained in the sigmoid notch sign: "positive" if 1 of the sigmoid notches was asymmetrically smaller than the other, consistent with a congenitally absent transverse sinus on that side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This sign was scored on CT scans by 2 blinded reviewers to determine if signal dropout was clot or atretic sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A consensus rating was reached when the reviewers disagreed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of the sigmoid notch sign as a diagnostic test were compared with a gold standard of full chart review by an independent reviewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Each reviewer had a sensitivity of 91% (detecting 10 of 11 clots based on a negative sigmoid notch sign) and specificity of 71% to 81%; consensus specificity increased to 86% (36 of 42 individuals with an atretic sinus had a positive notch sign, detecting atretic sinuses based on presence of the sign) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetries of the sigmoid notches on noncontrast brain CT is a very sensitive and specific measure of differentiating transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from an atretic transverse sinus when absence of transverse sinus flow is visualized on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
