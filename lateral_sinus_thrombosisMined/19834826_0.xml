<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Lumbar drains are frequently used in clinical neuroscience and are often managed in the neurointensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications are generally rare, and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (IVT) and infarction has not been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who developed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after spinal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen hours after placement of a lumbar drain she developed pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0010523'>alexia</z:hpo> and color <z:hpo ids='HP_0010524'>agnosia</z:hpo> caused by left lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with hemorrhagic infarction in the posterior inferior left temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We review the literature on the association of IVT with injury to the spinal dura, and we propose a mechanism whereby the lumbar drain may facilitate its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found 29 cases in which spinal dural injury was followed by IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association is not coincidental, because nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases were associated with post-dural puncture <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, which occurs in only a minority of cases of dural puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Injury to the spinal dura alters the distribution of craniospinal elasticity causing profound intracranial CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> on assuming the erect posture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dilation of cerebral veins resulting in both orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277919" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">venous stasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that placement of the lumbar drain and elevation of the head of the bed aggravated intracranial CSF <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and facilitated IVT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When a lumbar drain is placed for treatment of a spinal CSF leak, the patient should remain flat in bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Any patient with post-dural injury <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> that intensifies after an initial plateau, persists for longer than a week, or loses its orthostatic character should be evaluated for intracranial sinus or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
