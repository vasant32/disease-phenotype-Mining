<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: 104 patients were reviewed, culled from published case reports from 1993 to 2011 on the PubMed database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> full text case reports on the PubMed database from 1993 to 2011 with patients less than or equal to 16 years of age that outlined specific treatments were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 73% of patients were male and average age of presentation was 7.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and otalgia, while the most common signs included otorrhea and neck stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scans had a sensitivity of 87% and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies had a sensitivity of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> organisms were isolated in 46% of cases, with beta hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus being most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Management included broad spectrum antibiotics (100%), mastoidectomy (94%), manipulation of the thrombosed sinus (50%), and anticoagulation (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was one in 104 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morbidities occurred in 10% of patients and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and septic hip joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a rare but treatable complication of otologic disease in the pediatric population, warranting a high index of suspicion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Management should include broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> perisinus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation is not definitively associated with improved outcomes and warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
