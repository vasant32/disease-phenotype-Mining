<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of radiological examination is very important to clarify both the diagnosis and the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Two patients with the diagnosis of otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and their MRI and MRV findings are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both of the patients presented had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in their transverse sinuses pre-operatively demonstrated by MRI causing decreased flow on MRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the treatment blood flow through the sinus increased significantly as the symptoms subsided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI and MRV are valuable tools for diagnosis and follow-up of otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
