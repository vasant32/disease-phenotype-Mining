<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period after surgery was 7.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 26% of the ears the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> was 'huge' involving the middle ear and the attic and filling the entire mastoid air cell system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A patient had lateral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with large <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatomas</z:hpo> underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty and, in most cases, cavity obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatomas</z:hpo> were removed using either intact canal wall mastoidectomy or tympanotomy approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recurrence rate (including both residual and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatomas</z:hpo>) for the total series was 15% and 12% for the 50 cases undergoing one-stage surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serviceable hearing (&lt; or = 30 dB) was achieved in 57% of the ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A reoperation was necessary in 26% and a third operation in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up examination, 94% of the ears had intact tympanic membranes but 4 patients (8%) suffered from cavity-related problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for the disappointing results of surgical treatment for childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
