<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: The authors conducted a retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was conducted at the tertiary referral and teaching hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An analysis was made about the clinical and operative findings, surgical techniques and approaches, the overall management and recovery of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were then compared with the relevant and available literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 70 cases, 47 (67%) had a single complication, of which eight (11%) had intracranial and 39 (56%) had extracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three (33%) had two or more complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The commonly encountered intracranial complications were otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, which were seen in 13 (19%), 10 (14%), and 6 (9%) cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the extracranial complications, mastoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, postauricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> were encountered in 26 (37%), 17 (24%) and 10 (14%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgeries were the main mode of treatment for these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>According to severity, we found four different types of the lateral sinus involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients with otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> failed to regain full facial function despite surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of nine patients with the diagnosis of otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and interhemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> expired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It constituted the mortality rate of 13% in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CSOM complications, despite its reduced incidence, still pose a great challenge in developing countries as the disease present in the advanced stage leading to difficulty in management and consequently higher morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
