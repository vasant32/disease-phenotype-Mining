<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We investigated the incidence of dural bone defects and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> following radical mastoidectomy or open cavity tympanoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 190 operations of 182 patients (97 males, 85 females; mean age 30.6 years; range 9 to 70 years) who underwent radical mastoidectomy (n=89) or open cavity tympanoplasty (n=101) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations included otomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with documented dural bone defects on examination or operation records were further evaluated by axial and coronal computed tomography scans of the temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> were studied by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Dural bone defects were detected in 17 patients perioperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 14 defects were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three iatrogenic bone defects were induced during obliteration of lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mastoid tegmen was the most common site of defects (41%) and the most common etiologic factor was <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>Encephalocele</z:hpo> was detected in one patient in whom radical mastoidectomy with lateral sinus obliteration was performed due to lateral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Encephalomalasia was found nearby the defect area in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dural bone defects associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> are not rare, the most common cause being <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Repair of dural lacerations requires watertight closure to prevent the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
