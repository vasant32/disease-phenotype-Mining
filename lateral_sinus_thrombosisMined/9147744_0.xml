<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a 33 years-old patient with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in the first trimester of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was diagnosed and followed-up by magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigations as to its aetiology were inconclusive and it followed a benign course without anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinuses has been found empirically to be related to states of deficiency of S protein, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and deshydration during pregnancy, to having previously taken contraceptive pills </plain></SENT>
