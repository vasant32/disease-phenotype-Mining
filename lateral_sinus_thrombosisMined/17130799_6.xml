<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases of LST caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> in ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our series of five patients, four patients were successfully treated by surgery without opening the sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, one of our patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> during preoperative antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Most patients with thrombotic/nonabscessed sinuses will have successful outcomes with this approach, but careful observation is needed, given the possibility of advancing disease </plain></SENT>
