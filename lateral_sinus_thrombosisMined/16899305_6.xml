<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To describe pathognomonic signs, evaluation management, operative findings, clinical course and outcome of otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> as complications of AOM and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two children, 9 and 13 years old, with the diagnosis of OH and TK and MRI findings are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial complications in children resulted from unsuccessful treatment of AOM, which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both of the presented children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in their sigmoid sinus preoperatively, demonstrated by MRI, causing decreased blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent a mastoidectomy and delamination of sigmoid sinus with puncture of sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After medical and surgical treatment, blood flow through the sinus increased significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> ceased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation of otogenic lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (LST) as a complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000371'>acute otitis media</z:hpo> (AOM) can be masked by antibiotic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> and a history of AOM seem to be indicative for otitic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI scans of patients with similar symptoms should be carefully studied to facilitate the early diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging play a major role in determining diagnosis and treatment plans in this intracranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Management included systemic antibiotics, short-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation and surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In our patients intensive i.v. antibiotic treatment, steroids, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> and surgery led to a significant improvement in the clinical condition </plain></SENT>
