<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 124 patients (5 months-16 years) underwent mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number, type and therapy of otitic complications is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine percent of the patients showed up with endocranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (five patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (five patients) and epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (five patients), one cerebral and one cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients developed more than one complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>THERAPY: A complete mastoidectomy was performed with exploration of the dura and punction of the lateral sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In several cases these procedures gave the first diagnostic hint for endocranial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The occurrence of endocranial complications in the era of antibiotics should not be underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>Cholesteatoma</z:hpo> is still a main risk factor for severe complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If there is any doubt, further imaging studies (CT, MRI) are necessary </plain></SENT>
