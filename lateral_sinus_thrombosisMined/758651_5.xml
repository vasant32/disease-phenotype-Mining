<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings included: (a) abrupt termination of RN activity in the midportion of a lateral sinus ("stump sign"); (b) nonvisualization on dynamic, increased visualization on static images ipsilateral to a prominent sinus groove on a plain skull radiograph; and (c) increased activity on static images with nonfilling on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RN demonstration of the "stump sign" is pathognomonic of lateral sinus occlusion; the latter two patterns require radiographic demonstration of an ipsilateral sinus groove or angiography for significance </plain></SENT>
