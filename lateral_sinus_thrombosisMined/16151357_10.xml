<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series identified through database search of otologic surgical cases managed by a single surgeon in four teaching hospitals over a 6-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients presenting with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of otogenic cause were the subjects of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with incomplete medical records or unknown outcomes were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>chronic otitis media</z:hpo> in 50% of cases, with five of these patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were seven associated intracranial complications in six patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent medical and surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aggressive and early surgical treatment was tailored to the degree of preoperative and intraoperative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sigmoid sinus was resected in six of the patients with a variable degree of inferior margin proportional to the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy alone under vascular control with reestablishment of flow was used to remove the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">septic thrombus</z:e> in the other six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no complications in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early and aggressive surgical intervention of this otogenic complication can potentially minimize mortality, hospital stay, and length of medical treatment </plain></SENT>
