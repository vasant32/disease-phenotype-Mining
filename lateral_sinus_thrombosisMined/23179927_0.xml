<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was a retrospective chart review, conducted in tertiary pediatric hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medical reports of eight children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> and lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from 1998 to 2011 were examined in terms of therapy, clinical recovery and radiological proof of lateral sinus recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three children presented <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of contralateral venous drainage system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Condition of sinuses was regularly monitored with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otologically and neurologically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children recovered fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received antibiotics; six received additional low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy was performed on six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incision and thrombectomy were applied in the other two, one involving internal jugular vein ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This latter case presented also contralateral venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo> proved permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other two children with contralateral sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> recovered fully after steroid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recanalization occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children except the one with internal jugular vein ligation, in whom good collateral circulation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anatomical variations of cerebral venous drainage system can frequently be observed and should be considered in treatment planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy with antibiotics and additional low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment is a safe, promising alternative to thrombectomy and internal jugular vein ligation in children with lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo>, also having contralateral sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recanalization can be expected within two to five months </plain></SENT>
