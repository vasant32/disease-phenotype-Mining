<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a man who presented a jugular vein <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> responsible for severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of clinical worsening despite intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> and symptomatic treatment, endovascular procedure including the placement of five venous stents, thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty, was performed and led to venous recanalization with successful clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient is still asymptomatic 3 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our report shows that venous stenting could represent an efficient alternative in the management of decoagulation refractory CVT </plain></SENT>
