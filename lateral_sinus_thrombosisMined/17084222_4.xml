<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to review our experience on intracranial complications secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> (OM), and to compare the results to those occurring 10-15 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed the timing of both otologic and neurosurgical treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with intracranial complications secondary to OM over a 7-year period were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review was undertaken at Beaumont University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation, radiological findings, microbiology, surgical management, and antibiotic use were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compare our findings to those of other international investigators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve cases were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain abscesses</z:e>, 4 had lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and 3 had petrous apicitis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of these cases were secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> OM and 4 were secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> OM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Malodorous otorrhea, otalgia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> were the primary symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anaerobic bacteria were the most commonly isolated organisms followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> underwent modified radical or radical mastoidectomy, and those who did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0009797'>cholesteatoma</z:hpo> underwent cortical mastoidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain abscesses</z:e> were drained before mastoid surgery; 2 were drained after mastoid surgery and 1 at the same time as otologic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeted at individual culture and sensitivity results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation and the frequency of occurrence of intracranial complications are similar to those occurring 10 years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The choice of antibiotics should include adequate anaerobic cover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We recommend that otologic surgery be performed at the same time as intracranial surgery for patients with mature <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain abscesses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
