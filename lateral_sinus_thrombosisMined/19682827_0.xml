<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a rare condition with a wide range of causes and a highly variable presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can lead to significant morbidity, but scant literature is available describing diagnosis and treatment when this occurs after ligation of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To discuss potential risk factors for cerebral vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after ligation of the internal jugular vein, and present current options for diagnosis and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old male construction worker was brought to the Emergency Department by Emergency Medical Services after sustaining a severe neck laceration from a hand-held grinder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was treated with ligation of the left internal jugular vein, but subsequently developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance venogram of the head revealed a left transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> requiring treatment with anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The placement of a lumboperitoneal shunt was ultimately needed for relief of his symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and aggressive therapeutic interventions are critical to prevent further morbidity in patients who develop cerebral vein and dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after ligation of the internal jugular vein </plain></SENT>
