<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study 56 patients with angiographically proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral venous thrombosis</z:hpo> (CVT) affecting dural sinuses are being reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one percent of the patients were female and 60% were below 30 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four percent of the patients had lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and in 26.8% of the cases a septic focus has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is established by serial angiography and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVT is not a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> while the clinical diagnosis may be difficult because of the variable modes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the CT findings are found to be non-specific, angiography remains as the best diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis, controlled intracranial pressure, and appropriate antibiotic treatment may reduce the mortality and morbidity rates due to CVT </plain></SENT>
