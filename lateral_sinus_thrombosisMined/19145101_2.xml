<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During this period, 3,364 patients with suppurative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>) were admitted to the department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of patients presenting with complications was 422 (12.54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of extracranial to intracranial complications was nearly 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most frequent extracranial complication was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> while the most frequent intracranial one was lateral sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple complications may present in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of complications was insidious and 96% of the patients were already aware of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 6 mortalities (1.42%), and additional morbidity was recorded in 16 patients (3.79%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be aware of the continuing incidence of complications and the subtleness of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and investigate patients for the presence of more than one complication </plain></SENT>
