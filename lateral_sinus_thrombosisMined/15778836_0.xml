<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study included eight patients aged 53-81 years (mean age: 61.9 years) with proven or highly probable septic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of transverse and sigmoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a pre- and post-contrast enhancement brain CT scans and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venogram (n=4) and HRCT of the temporal bone were performed when diagnosis was under discussion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After admission, the delay in diagnosis of lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> ranged from 8 to 60 days, with an average of 27 days (SD: +/-12.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delay in diagnosis was mainly due to non focused CT scans (6/8) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images performed at the initial presentation and absence of systematic radiological reading of the related fatty spaces and of skull base in bone windows (3/8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of septic origin of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is of great importance, as it completely modifies the therapeutic planning of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it remains a difficult challenge due to its lack of suggestive neurological or otolaryngologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
