<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 36 children referred to paediatric neurology and neurosurgery during April 1995-June 1998 with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural haematoma</z:hpo> (SDH) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine were accidental secondary to witnessed trauma and 4 were iatrogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Non-accidental head injury (NAHI) was suspected in the remaining 23 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a full clinical, radiological and social assessment, NAHI was diagnosed in 14, lateral sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 1, 2 were accepted as accidental and 6 remained unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the NAHI group (n=14), 12 were between 4 and 16 weeks of age, 12 (85%) had <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> haemorrhages and skeletal surveys showed evidence of additional injury in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerised tomography (CT) brain scans showed bilateral SDH in 11, and 6 had inter-hemispheric <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> along with loss of grey-white differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which yielded additional information in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven required intensive care, and 2 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve had surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the group with no satisfactory explanation for SDH ( n=6); 5 had neonatal problems, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except 1 were older than 5 months of age and not as ill with bilateral, old SDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 had skeletal surveys, which were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and eye examination showed no <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A social services enquiry was non-contributory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SDH is frequently traumatic whether accidental or non-accidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SDH due to NAHI tends to present before 4 months of age with an inconsistent history; the patients are more seriously ill and have other findings, such as fractures and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A small subgroup of patients was identified who had isolated, old SDH and in whom full investigation remained inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A consistent, comprehensive approach needs to be maintained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with the essential backup of detailed neuro-imaging including MRI </plain></SENT>
