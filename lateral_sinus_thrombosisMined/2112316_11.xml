<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the angiographic findings from six patients with intracranial dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> of the inferior petrosal sinus and describe the clinical presentation, vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, and embolization techniques used in the treatment of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> at this site are rare; of 105 patients diagnosed with this abnormality, only six had lesions involving the inferior petrosal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients included three men and three women, ranging in age from 41 to 75 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients presented with bruit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011349'>abducens palsy</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo>, and symptoms were present for up to 1 year prior to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These presentations were similar to cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The arterial supply in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was from branches of the external carotid artery and in three cases from the meningohypophyseal trunk of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Venous drainage in four patients was via the cavernous sinus to the superior ophthalmic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining two patients had drainage primarily to the jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four patients treatment was performed by introducing wire coils into the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> from the transvenous route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This approach could be used even though the inferior petrosal sinus was thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient, treated early in the series, had only transarterial embolization with both liquid adhesives and particulate embolic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had an asymptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> that was not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were cured, as evidenced both angiographically and clinically during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients experienced complications from angiography and treatment: two had transverse sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and one had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
