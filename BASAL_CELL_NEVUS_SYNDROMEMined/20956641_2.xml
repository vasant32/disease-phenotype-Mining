<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Forty-one ambulatory patients with BCNS who participated in a 2-year chemoprevention clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Population-based controls (n = 360) were selected and matched by age, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type, and season/geography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo> (defined as a 25[OH]D level of â‰¤20 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with BCNS (56%) were <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> deficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with BCNS had mean 25(OH)D levels below those of the general population (-3 ng/mL; P = .02) and were 3 times more likely to be <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> deficient (56% vs 18%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of 25(OH)D were lower in patients who were overweight (-3.0 ng/mL; P = .04) and who had blood collected in the winter compared with the summer (-7.1 ng/mL; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Patients with BCNS may be at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100512'>vitamin D deficiency</z:hpo>, depending on their adherence to photoprotection practices </plain></SENT>
