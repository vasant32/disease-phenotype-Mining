<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here our use of one of these target genes, hedgehog-interacting protein (Hip1), as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-associated antigen for immunoprevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> in Ptch1+/- mice treated with ionizing radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hip1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed in adult mouse tissues at levels considerably lower than those in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunization with either of two large recombinant Hip1 <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptides</z:chebi> was well tolerated in Ptch1+/- mice, induced B and T cell responses detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed type hypersensitivity</z:mp>, and enzyme-linked immunospot assay, and reduced the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> by 42% (P &lt; 0.001) and 32% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that immunization with proteins specifically up-regulated by hedgehog signaling may hold promise as a preventive option for patients such as those with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome who are destined to develop large numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
