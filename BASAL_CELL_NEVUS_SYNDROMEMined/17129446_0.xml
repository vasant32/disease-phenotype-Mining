<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The proband and his affected mother and a unaffected individual in the pedigree were chosen and peripheral blood was collected from them for DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing was performed to detect the mutations of PTCH gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to further confirm the results of sequence analysis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available family members were analyzed with genetic linkage analysis using 3 highly polymorphic microsatellite DNA markers in the region of 9q22.3-q31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No mutations of PTCH gene was detected in the proband's mother, one synonymous mutation was detected in the proband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis showed that the Lod scores of the 3 markers were: D9S283, Z = -2.11 (theta = 0.00); D9S1690, Z = -2.95 (theta = 0.00); D9S1677, Z = -5.94 (theta = 0.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this pedigree, mutation of PTCH gene is not related to the underlying pathogenesis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
