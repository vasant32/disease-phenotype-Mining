<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCNS is caused by mutations in the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene-1, PTCH1, which is mapped on chromosome 9q22.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonsense, frameshift, in-frame deletions, splice-site, and missense mutations have been found in the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency of PTCH1, which is caused by interstitial deletion of 9q22.3, is also responsible for the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, 19 cases with interstitial deletion of long arm of chromosome 9 involving the region of q22 have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We describe two unrelated patients with some typical features of BCNS associated with deletion of 9q21.33-q31.1 and determined the boundary of the deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome (BAC) clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the size of deletions is between 15.33 and 16.04 Mb in patient 1 and between 18.08 and 18.54 Mb in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the size and breakpoints were different from those of previously reported cases, the clinical features are common to patients with 9q22 deletion associated with BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Delineation of the 9q22 deletions and further consideration of the genes responsible for the characteristic manifestations may provide insight into this newly recognized deletion syndrome </plain></SENT>
