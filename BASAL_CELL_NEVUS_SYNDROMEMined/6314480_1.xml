<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The use of this test in 44 patients (29 healthy subjects, 7 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002150'>hypercalciuria</z:hpo> 5 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029401" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Paget's disease</z:e>, 1 patient with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000829'>hypoparathyroidism</z:hpo>, 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome) who received different doses of this substance intravenously, revealed a marked dose-dependent stimulation of adenyl-cyclase as objectified by an increase in urinary excretion of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> (AMPcU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distal tubular calcium reabsorption was also significantly affected as demonstrated by a decrease in urinary calcium in the first hours following administration of the 1-34 fragment even in the case of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002150'>hypercalciuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the "classical" Ellsworth-Howard test, however, no significant urinary phosphate response was observed during the present test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, urinary <z:chebi fb="2" ids="18095">hydroxyproline</z:chebi> and phosphate and calcium blood levels remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As the results obtained for the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000829'>hypoparathyroidism</z:hpo> demonstrate, this easily performed test is useful for valuating parathormone receptors in kidney by means of two sensitive parameters (AMPcU and the ratio of fractional urinary calcium to urinary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to its action, synthetic fragment h PTH-1-34 offers the advantage of being totally innocuous </plain></SENT>
