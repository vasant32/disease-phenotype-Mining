<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although they are benign, they tend to be aggressive, with local invasion of bony structures, extensive growth, and potential for substantial disfigurement and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0234516" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">speech dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete surgical resection is the current standard of care; however, the procedures are often technically challenging and are followed by high recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: We report the case of a 55-year-old man with a long-standing history of BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Over a 25-year period, this patient had been treated for many <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He also had multiple large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocysts</z:e> in the mandible that had previously been treated using surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiation treatment techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He had also undergone a right inguinal lymph node dissection after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was diagnosed within a lymph node </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Owing to the recalcitrant nature of his condition and his history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, the patient was started on a daily regimen of a new oral drug, GDC-0449, which inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway, a key genetic contributor in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oncogenesis</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to complete resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> his <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> at 12-week follow-up, nearly complete resolution of 3 odontogenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> was documented by serial dental radiographs after 2 years of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report the nearly complete regression of multiple BCNS-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocysts</z:e> following nonsurgical treatment with GDC-0449 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This novel drug, useful for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>, also appears to be effective for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocysts</z:e> </plain></SENT>
