<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 5.1 per cent of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> were from patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome and 5.8 per cent were from patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> but with no other features of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a wide age range, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mandible: maxilla ratio was 2:1, with the mandibular third molar area and ramus being the most common sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dentigerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> was the most frequent clinical as well as histologic diagnosis for the majority of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primordial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> comprised the greatest percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> (44.4 per cent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 50.3 per cent of the patients were symptomatic before seeking treatment, the most common finding being intraoral drainage and swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their radiographic appearance was quite variable, although they frequently resembled <z:mpath ids='MPATH_381'>ameloblastoma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> may be very aggressive clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They have a relatively high recurrence rate, as previously reported in the literature, in comparison with other types of odontogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings in this study support the theory that the histologic appearance of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocyst</z:e> may be assumed by any of the odontogenic or nonodontogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
