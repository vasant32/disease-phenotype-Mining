<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functions of PTC were investigated by inactivating the mouse gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice homozygous for the ptc mutation died during embryogenesis and were found to have open and overgrown neural tubes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two Shh target genes, ptc itself and Gli, were derepressed in the ectoderm and mesoderm but not in the endoderm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shh targets that are, under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions, transcribed ventrally were aberrantly expressed in dorsal and lateral neural tube cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus Ptc appears to be essential for repression of genes that are locally activated by Shh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice heterozygous for the ptc mutation were larger than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and a subset of them developed hindlimb defects or <z:hpo ids='HP_0007129'>cerebellar medulloblastomas</z:hpo>, abnormalities also seen in BCNS patients </plain></SENT>
