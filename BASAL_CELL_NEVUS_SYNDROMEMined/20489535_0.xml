<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the histopathologic findings in a series of eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> removed from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case series of 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome identified from our oculoplastics service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The systemic and ophthalmic features were reviewed, and a retrospective histopathologic analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available previously excised eyelid lesions was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pertinent published literature on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome and eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 26 eyelid lesions were examined histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of these lesions were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The infundibulocystic variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was identified most commonly (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome were commonly of the infundibulocystic variety in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infundibulocystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, which can be clinically indistinguishable from the more common forms, are thought to be less aggressive than other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and are a reassuring histopathologic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important for the ophthalmologist and pathologist to be aware of infundibulocystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo>, as they are more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome and may be a clue to the diagnosis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-predisposition syndrome or other associated syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this variant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> has not been previously discussed in the ophthalmic literature </plain></SENT>
