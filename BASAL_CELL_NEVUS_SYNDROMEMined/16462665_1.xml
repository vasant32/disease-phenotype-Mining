<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>Basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>) is a cutaneous, generally primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, most common among the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient presenting numerous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> several years after radiation therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153392" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasopharyngeal cancer</z:e> and discuss the risk factors for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and the role played by radiation in its genesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 30-year-old woman presented with pigmented facial lesions that had been developing over the past year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven years earlier, she had had an undifferentiated nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (T3N2M0), which was treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then external radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial cutaneous examination noted two lesions that were identified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> after biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were excised surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither clinical nor radiological check up showed signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> is the most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is observed mainly among those aged 45-60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disorders that might promote or complicate <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> should be systematically sought in young patients, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While our patient may have had this syndrome, we found none of the other clinical or radiographic elements often observed with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> within the irradiation area, the multiplicity of lesions, and the sufficient latency period are consistent with radiation-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no reports in the literature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> following radiation treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153392" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasopharyngeal cancer</z:e>, but the occurrence of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in our patient suggests the need for close supervision in such cases </plain></SENT>
