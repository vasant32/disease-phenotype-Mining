<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, Happle and Tinschert [Acta Derm Venereol 2008;88:382-387] described the case of a multisystem birth defect with segmentally arranged basaloid follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> associated with extracutaneous defects in the form of short leg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000685'>hypoplastic teeth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors presented a comprehensive overview of 8 similar cases reported under various designations, and provided evidence that this syndrome includes various additional defects of the bones, teeth and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, a further typical case is reported, and it is emphasized that this phenotype should no longer be categorized as '<z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome', and thus be confused with the nevoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> syndrome of Gorlin [<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> 1965;18:89-104] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 7-year-old boy had multiple whitish and some scattered brownish basaloid follicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010566'>hamartomas</z:hpo> involving the right side of his body in a systematized pattern following the lines of Blaschko </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These lesions had been present since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were <z:mp ids='MP_0003815'>hairless</z:mp> and conspicuously hypopigmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, enamel defects and mild webbing of the first and second right toes were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the age of 5 years, the boy developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> that originated from the ipsilateral paramedian vermis region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was surgically removed, and subsequently radiotherapy and chemotherapy were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of blood DNA did not reveal any Patched mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis of the disorder remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From this case and from 9 similar cases reported in the literature, the spectrum of a distinct phenotype is delineated, and the eponymic designation Happle-Tinschert syndrome is proposed </plain></SENT>
