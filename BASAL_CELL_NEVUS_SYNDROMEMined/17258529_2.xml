<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Interventional case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical examination, color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), detailed electrophysiological assessment, and mutation screening of PTCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protocol of the study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 34-year-old man with findings consistent with GS was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmoscopy and OCT identified bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100014'>epiretinal membranes</z:hpo> (ERMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fundus autofluorescence (AF) imaging and electrophysiological testing [full-field electroretinogram (ERG), pattern ERG, and electrooculogram] were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation screening identified a novel nonsense mutation in PTCH (c.1136C &gt; G; p.Ser383X), the gene associated with GS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of bilateral ERM in GS with a molecular genetic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also document data supporting the lack of focal or generalized <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
