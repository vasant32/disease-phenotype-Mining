<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts was then compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004779,C0812437" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Gorlin syndrome</z:e>-derived fibroblasts (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome [BCNS]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of clonogenic survival, no significant differences were observed between the two groups of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the alkaline comet assay, initial DNA damage after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some DNA damage was detected at higher doses, but this was fully repaired within 24 h of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BCNS-derived cells showed levels of initial damage that did not differ significantly from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lines </plain></SENT>
