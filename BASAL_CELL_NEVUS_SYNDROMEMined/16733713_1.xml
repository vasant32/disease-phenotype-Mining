<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We revisited a large Ashkenazim pedigree, first reported in 1968, with multiple diagnoses of BCNS and IBD, and with a common genetic cause for both disorders proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We expanded the pedigree to four generations and performed a genome-wide linkage study for BCNS and IBD traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve members with BCNS, seven with IBD, five with both diagnoses and eight unaffected were genotyped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both non-parametric (GENEHUNTER 2.1) and parametric (FASTLINK) linkage analyses were performed and a validation through simulation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BCNS linked to chromosome 9q22 (D9S1120) just proximal to the PTCH1 gene (NPL=3.26, P=0.003; parametric two-point LOD=2.4, parametric multipoint LOD=3.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Novel IBD linkage evidence was observed at chromosome 1p13 (D1S420, NPL 3.92, P=0.0047; parametric two-point LOD=1.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Linkage evidence was also observed to previously reported IBD loci on 4q, (D4S2623, NPL 3.02, P=0.012; parametric two-point LOD=2.15), 10q23 (D10S1225 near DLG5, NPL 3.33, P=0.0085; parametric two-point LOD=1.3), 12 overlapping the IBD2 locus (D12S313, NPL 2.6, P=0.018; parametric two-point LOD=1.52), and 7q (D7S510 and D7S3046, NPL 4.06, P=0.0035; parametric two-point LOD=2.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this pedigree affected by both BCNS and IBD, the two traits and their respective candidate genetic loci segregate independently; BCNS maps to the PTCH1 gene and IBD maps to several candidate regions, mostly overlapping previously observed IBD loci </plain></SENT>
