<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To search for patched homologue 1 (PTCH1) mutations in four families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (BCNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mutation analysis of PTCH1 in unrelated Japanese families affected with BCNS was carried out by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six novel PTCH1 mutations, 833G--&gt;A in exon 6, 1415C--&gt;A and 1451G--&gt;T in exon 10, 2798delC in exon 17, 2918-2925dupAGTTCCCT in exon 18 and 3956C--&gt;A in exon 23, were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among the six PTCH1 mutations, two frameshift mutations (2798delC and 2918-2925dupAGTTCCCT) and one nonsense mutation (833G--&gt;A) are predicted to lead to premature termination of PTCH1 protein translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three simultaneous mutations, 1415C--&gt;A (A472D) and 1451G--&gt;T (G484V) in exon 10, and 3956G--&gt;A (R1319H) in exon 23, were found on one allele in only affected members in one family and none of them were found among 90 unrelated healthy Japanese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three mutations on one chromosome may have resulted from errors in the recombinational repair process and this is the first report on the PTCH1 mutations due to such a mechanism </plain></SENT>
