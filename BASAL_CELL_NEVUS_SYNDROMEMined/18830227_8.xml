<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the X chromosome, genomic deletions appear to be more prevalent than duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of a lack of accurate diagnostic methods, submicroscopic duplications have been under-ascertained for a long period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of array CGH has enabled the detection of chromosomal microduplications with nearly the same sensitivity as deletions, leading to the discovery of previously unrecognized syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a clinical targeted oligonucleotide array (CMA-V6.3 OLIGO), we identified an approximately 360-kb duplication in 9q22.32 in a 21-month-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same duplication was identified in the patient's mother who is also microcephalic and mildly delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced the chromosomal breakpoints and determined the duplication as tandem in orientation and 363 599 bp in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duplicated segment harbors the entire PTCH1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deletions or loss-of-function mutations of PTCH1 result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004779,C0812437" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Gorlin syndrome</z:e>), whereas gain-of-function mutations were proposed to lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001360'>holoprosencephaly</z:hpo> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001360'>holoprosencephaly</z:hpo> of unknown origin should also be screened for PTCH1 duplication </plain></SENT>
