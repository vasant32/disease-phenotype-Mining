<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Analysis of DNA fiber autoradiograms from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (BCNS) skin fibroblasts has revealed for the first time a new defect in DNA replication earlier unknown in other <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> syndromes, that involves a significantly decreased rate of DNA-chain growth in unirradiated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we present evidence that the defect may be due to a marked reduction in number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group remaining unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Radioresistant DNA synthesis was observed in the BCNS cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exposure of cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor to gamma-rays at a dose of 5 Gy reduces the number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons to the level occurring in unirradiated BCNS cells, the rate of folk movement being unchanged in both cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of fusion between neighbouring units within the group is lower in the cells exposed to gamma-rays, due perhaps to a radiation-induced lesion in the group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, ionizing radiation reduces the rate of DNA synthesis to the same level, however from different initial levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the phenomenon of radioresistant DNA synthesis may be explained by the presence of the initial defect in DNA replication in BCNS or any other <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> disorders </plain></SENT>
