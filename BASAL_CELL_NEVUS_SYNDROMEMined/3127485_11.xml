<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that of 75 keratocysts with follow-up times ranging from 5 to 17 years (mean 8.3), 32 (43%) recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative recurrence rate of the 67 annually examined <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> increased from 3% after the 1st year following the operation to 37% after the 3rd year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, no new recurrences were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome occurred more frequently than that of patients without the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Keratocysts</z:e> enucleated in one piece recurred significantly less often than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> enucleated in several pieces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recurrence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> with a clinically observable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> or with a perforated bony wall was higher than that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> without these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrence was also found more frequently in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> with multilocular radiographic appearance than in unilocular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size or the location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> did not have an influence on the recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
