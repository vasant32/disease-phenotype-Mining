<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrate that Sonic hedgehog is expressed in human lung squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (LK-2 and EBC-1) and some <z:mp ids='MP_0009308'>adenocarcinoma</z:mp> cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of Sonic hedgehog is also detected in the human lung squamous <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> tissues, but not in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lung tissue of the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal region of Sonic hedgehog stimulates the incorporation of BrdU into LK-2 cells and stimulates their cell growth, while anti-Shh-N inhibits their cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a Sonic hedgehog signal is involved in the cell growth of LK-2 cells </plain></SENT>
