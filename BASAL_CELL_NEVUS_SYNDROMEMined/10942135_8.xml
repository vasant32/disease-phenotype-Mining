<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical records and pathological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocysts</z:e> from 69 ethnic Hong Kong Chinese patients (40 male and 29 female patients) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1; patient age ranged from 6 to 69 years with a modal peak in the third decade (mean age, 28 y; median age, 23 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative diagnosis was correct in 78% of the cases and the most common misdiagnosis was dentigerous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two percent of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were found in the mandible, and 38% in the maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> occurred in 9% (including three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histologically, 82.6%, 5.8%, and 11.6% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were parakeratinized, orthokeratinized, and mixed types, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed parakeratinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority (80%) of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were lined by epithelia with a thickness of five to eight cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surface corrugation, subepithelial split, suprabasal split, satellite microcysts, epithelial islands, significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, hyaline bodies, and dystrophic calcification were present in 10%, 81%, 25%, 38%, 42%, 46%, 7%, and 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall recurrence rate was 240%, with a median time for first recurrence of 19 months (range, 1 mo-22 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>Cysts</z:mpath> showing orthokeratinization or mixed types of keratinization recurred less often than parakeratinized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrence had the same type of keratinization as the initial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pathological examination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> is important, because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> have different clinicopathological features and carry a risk for clinical misdiagnosis </plain></SENT>
