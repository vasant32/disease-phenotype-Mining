<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> requires surgical excisions and may lead to unaesthetic scars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) is a validated treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancers</z:e>, with good cosmetic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate patient's satisfaction, cosmetic outcome and number of surgical excisions before and after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>, in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome, treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire evaluated satisfaction, cosmetic outcomes for surgery and <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of surgeries before and after <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> was noted and efficacy was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients were evaluated; 85% of patients were satisfied with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> vs. 55% for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average visual analogue score for the cosmetic result was 8.42/10 for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> vs. 6.3/10 for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean number of surgical excisions was 4.4 during the 6 months before the first session of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> and 0.57 after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Methylaminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy seems an interesting option for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
