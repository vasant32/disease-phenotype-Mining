<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Dysregulated hedgehog signaling is the pivotal molecular abnormality underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vismodegib is a new orally administered hedgehog-pathway inhibitor that produces objective responses in locally advanced and metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> efficacy of vismodegib in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome at three clinical centers from September 2009 through January 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was reduction in the incidence of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> that were eligible for surgical resection (surgically eligible) with vismodegib versus placebo after 3 months; secondary end points included reduction in the size of existing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 41 patients followed for a mean of 8 months (range, 1 to 15) after enrollment, the per-patient rate of new surgically eligible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> was lower with vismodegib than with placebo (2 vs. 29 cases per group per year, P&lt;0.001), as was the size (percent change from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter) of existing clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> (-65% vs. -11%, P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> clinically regressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> progressed during treatment with vismodegib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving vismodegib routinely had grade 1 or 2 adverse events of loss of taste, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003394'>muscle cramps</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>hair loss</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 54% of patients (14 of 26) receiving vismodegib discontinued drug treatment owing to adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 month, vismodegib use had reduced the hedgehog target-gene expression by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> by 90% (P&lt;0.001) and diminished <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-cell proliferation, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was detectable in 83% of biopsy samples taken from sites of clinically regressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vismodegib reduces the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> burden and blocks growth of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell carcinomas</z:hpo> in patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The adverse events associated with treatment led to discontinuation in over half of treated patients </plain></SENT>
