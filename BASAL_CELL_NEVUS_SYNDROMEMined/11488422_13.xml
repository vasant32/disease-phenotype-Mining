<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the immunohistochemical expressions of cell-cycle- and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related factors to investigate the possible role of these factors in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocyst</z:e> (OKC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Expression of cyclin D1 and p16 protein was detected in the basal and parabasal cells in lining epithelium of OKCs and was found more frequently in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (BCNS)-associated OKCs than in primary or recurrent OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Positivity for p21 protein was detected in basal to superficial cells, whereas that for p27 protein was detected in parabasal to superficial cells in lining epithelium of OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA topoisomerase IIalpha reacted with nuclei in basal and parabasal cells of the lining epithelium of OKCs, and positive cells were observed in BCNS-associated OKCs significantly more frequently than in primary or recurrent OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of Fas in suprabasal to superficial cells and expression of Fas-L in basal and parabasal cells were detected in lining epithelium of OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for caspase-3 was detected in basal to suprabasal or superficial cells in lining epithelium of OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single stranded (ss)DNA-positive nuclei were detected in superficial cells in lining epithelium of OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fas was more broadly distributed in BCNS-associated OKCs than in primary OKCs, and ssDNA-positive cells were observed in BCNS-associated OKCs significantly more frequently than in primary or recurrent OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BCNS-associated OKCs might be a distinguishable entity from solitary OKCs </plain></SENT>
