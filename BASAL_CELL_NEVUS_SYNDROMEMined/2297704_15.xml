<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the cellular and molecular basis for BCNS is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether there is any relationship between genetic predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> and increased sensitivity of somatic cells from BCNS patients to killing by UV radiation, we exposed skin fibroblasts established from unexposed skin biopsies of several BCNS and age- and sex-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals to either UV-B (280-320 nm) or UV-C (254 nm) radiation and determined their survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that skin fibroblasts from BCNS patients were hypersensitive to killing by UV-B but not UV-C radiation as compared to skin fibroblasts from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA repair studies indicated that the increased sensitivity of BCNS skin fibroblasts to killing by UV-B radiation was not due to a defect in the excision repair of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that there is an association between hypersensitivity of somatic cells to killing by UV-B radiation and the genetic predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> in BCNS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, these results suggest that DNA lesions (and repair processes) other than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16898">pyrimidine</z:chebi> dimer are also involved in the pathogenesis of sunlight-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancers</z:e> in BCNS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More important, the UV-B sensitivity assay described here may be used as a diagnostic tool to identify presymptomatic individuals with BCNS </plain></SENT>
