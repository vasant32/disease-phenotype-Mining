<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In support of alternative differentiation, a case of an "apocrine" <z:mp ids='MP_0009877'>poroma</z:mp> is reported in a 19-year-old man with the nevoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A papule on the right cheek, thought clinically to be a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, was excised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anastomosing lobules of small uniform basaloid (poroid) cells formed small ductular structures lined by eosinophilic cuticles and extended into the superficial reticular dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> originated from follicular infundibula and was surrounded by a myxoid stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Focally, primitive hair bulb and papillae differentiation was present, and some of the ducts were lined by cells suggesting decapitation secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The histologic pattern and the common embryologic origin of the folliculosebaceous-apocrine unit support apocrine differentiation of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The association with the nevoid basal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> syndrome appears to be unique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case, in addition, demonstrates overlapping features with the infundibulocystic type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> commonly seen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
