<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by developmental anomalies and predisposition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (for example, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PTCH1, the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene, was identified as a gene responsible for BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The PTCH1 protein is a Hedgehog (Hh) protein receptor and is pivotal for early development, stem cell maintenance and/or differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the six Japanese families with BCNS and identified six germline mutations in the PTCH1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One family had a nonsense mutation (c.1196G&gt;A), one had a 1-bp deletion (c.2029delA), two had 2-bp deletions (c.239_240delGA and c.1670_1671delCA) and one had a 58-bp duplication (c.1138_1195dup) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They caused premature termination, resulting in the truncation of the PTCH1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array showed a large approximately 1.2-Mb deletion, including the PTCH1 gene in one allele, in a family in which PTCH1 mutations were not identified at the sequence level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the six families who were diagnosed with BCNS had mutations in the PTCH1 gene and that a single copy of a PTCH1 mutation causes BCNS </plain></SENT>
