<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Patched (PTC) gene is responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (BCNS) accompanied by multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocysts</z:e> (OKCs), and its product plays a role in the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway involving smoothened (SMO) and GLI-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of SHH signaling in OKCs, the expression of SHH, PTC, SMO, and GLI-1 and mutations of PTC were examined in 18 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, 4 BCNS-associated OKCs and 7 control gingivae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SHH, PTC, SMO, and GLI-1 were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> OKC and gingiva samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity for SHH and GLI-1 was markedly higher in epithelial components than in subepithelial cells, while immunoreactivity for PTC and SMO was similar in epithelial components and subepithelial cells in OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of PTC and SMO expression in subepithelial cells of OKCs was significantly higher than that in gingivae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of GLI-1 expression in subepithelial cells of BCNS-associated OKCs was significantly higher than that in primary OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the SHH signaling might be involved in the pathophysiologic nature of OKCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While mutations of the PTC gene could not be detected in 4 BCNS-associated OKCs by direct DNA sequencing, 3 of 5 primary and 4 of 4 recurrent OKCs had several mutations of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PTC mutations are probably related not only to BCNS-associated OKCs but also to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> OKCs </plain></SENT>
