<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease exhibits a dominant autosomal hereditary trait, with implication of the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity Patched (PTCH) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCNS is diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria and can be confirmed by genetic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient prognosis is very good, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life expectancy in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study reports two cases of BCNS with the presence of maxillo-mandibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010603'>keratocystic odontogenic tumors</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One case was diagnosed according to clinical criteria, while the other required genetic confirmation that revealed a germ line mutation in exon 17 (c.2868delC), not previously described in the databases, which was considered to be responsible for the disease </plain></SENT>
