<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were irradiated with single or double doses of gamma-rays or UV light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the double dose irradiation protocol, the two doses were separated from each other by 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After irradiation of cells with 4 or 2 + 2 J/m2 UV light, lymphocytes from seven BCNS patients had a similar number of aberrant cells compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, while cells from three <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> patients showed a significantly increased number of cells containing aberrations, particularly chromatid-type aberrations, compared to controls (p &lt; 0.03, Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed whether the cells were irradiated with single or double doses of UV light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, lymphocytes from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> patients had significantly lower mitotic indices than controls whether the cultures were irradiated with UV light or unirradiated (p &lt; 0.05; Student's t-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After irradiation with 100, 100 + 100 or 50 + 50 cGy gamma-rays, the mean chromosome aberration frequencies from nine BCNS patients and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> patients were not significantly different from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous chromosome aberration frequencies were similar for the patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that BCNS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> lymphocytes irradiated with gamma-rays have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> DNA repair response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EV</z:e> patients have an abnormal repair response to UV light induced DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This abnormality is probably caused by deficiency in DNA repair and it is consistent with the patients' sensitivity to UV light induced cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
