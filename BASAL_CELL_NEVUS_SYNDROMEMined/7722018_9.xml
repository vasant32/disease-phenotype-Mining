OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to describe the clinical, histologic, and DNA ploidy findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> with these cytologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> from 15 patients were prospectively collected, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> in these patients were retrospectively reviewed by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One lesion was recurrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of the pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> and one nonpleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> were studied by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> ranged from 2.8 to 12.5 mm in greatest diameter and were most commonly located on the head and neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> were present on the face and scalp of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There have been no subsequent recurrences of the pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> (follow-up from 3 to 32 months; median, 20 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> displayed characteristic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>: peripheral palisading, stromal retraction, mucin production, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 also showed huge pleomorphic mononucleated and multinucleated giant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nuclei of these large cells were often hyperchromatic with prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm, and occasionally with intranuclear cytoplasmic protrusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were frequent and atypical mitoses in 47% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> studied by cell image analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue were aneuploid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The DNA content of the giant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells was not a multiple of a single DNA value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pleomorphic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> clinically present as typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite their striking focal cellular atypia, these lesions seem to behave as ordinary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
