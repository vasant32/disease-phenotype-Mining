<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the changes in cell survival, unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) induced by ultraviolet light (UVL) in confluent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and BCNS fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCNS cells appeared slightly hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effects of UVL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate of UDS induced by UVL exposure in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell strains increased linearly following doses up to 30 J/m2, whereas in BCNS cells UDS became saturated at doses of 10 J/m2 showing no further increase with doses up to 30 J/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>UDS activity persisted for longer periods after UVL exposure in BCNS as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose-response relationship for UVL-induced SCE was similar in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and BCNS fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the frequencies of UVL-induced SCE declined to near background levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells following 12-24 hr of confluent holding prior to subculture whereas they remained elevated in BCNS cells with holding times up to 24 hr after UVL exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results suggest that BCNS fibroblasts may have a diminished capacity for the repair of some type of DNA damage as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
