<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (BCNS) patients, mutations of a gene, patched (ptc), which encodes a putative signal transducer of sonic hedgehog protein (SHH), were found and are thought to be one of the major causes of BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The SHH signaling pathway is an important developmental pathway, and ptc protein (PTC) is a suppressive component serving as a receptor for the secreted SHH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another transmembrane protein, smoothened (SMO), forms a complex with PTC and regulates this signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent transgenic studies have strengthened the importance of the SHH signaling system in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the expression patterns of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for ptc and smo in two different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> subtypes and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the expressions of ptc and smo <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were enhanced in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> nests of the nodular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>, especially at the advancing portions, but were under the detectable level in the superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> cases examined, indicating that ptc and smo <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions might be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178874" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor progression</z:e> and divide the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> histologic types into two subtypes, superficial and nodular types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, no obvious signals for ptc and smo <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were detected in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human epidermis, appendages, or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_158'>seborrheic keratosis</z:mpath>, indicating that the abnormal proliferation of follicular epithelial cells caused by ptc, smo and/or other genetic changes, which also cause ptc and smo overexpressions, might result in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
