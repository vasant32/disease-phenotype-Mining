<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells from an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (AT) homozygote showed no dose-rate effect, whereas a three- to fivefold increase in D0 was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other cell strains exposed at low dose rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the dose-rate effect did not differ significantly among cells from persons with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0009919'>retinoblastoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome, or AT-heterozygote compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell strains, and was not related to the size of the shoulder (extrapolation number) of the survival curve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no differences in the capacity for the repair of potentially lethal damage during confluent holding were observed among these latter cell strains </plain></SENT>
