<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of introducing genomic instability into murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e>, we have compared ionizing radiation-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> in Ptch1(+/-) mice versus that in Ptch1(+/-) mice carrying mutant Blm alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> in Ptch1(+/-) Blm(tm3Brd/tm3Brd) mice had a trend toward greater genomic instability as measured by array comprehensive genomic hybridization and that these mice developed significantly more microscopic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> than did Ptch1(+/-) Blm(+/tm3Brd) or Ptch1(+/-) Blm(+/+) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutant Blm alleles also markedly enhanced the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcomas</z:hpo> (RMSs), another <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> to which Ptch1(+/)(-) mice and PTCH1(+/)(-) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome) patients are susceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Highly recurrent but different copy number changes were associated with the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> types and included losses of chromosomes 4 and 10 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> and gain of chromosome 10 in 80% of RMSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss of chromosome 11 and 13, including the Trp53 and Ptch1 loci, respectively, occurred frequently in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e>, suggesting tissue-specific selection for genes or pathways that collaborate with Ptch deficiency in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the quantitative differences, there was no dramatic qualititative difference in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e> or RMS <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> associated with the mutant Blm genotype </plain></SENT>
