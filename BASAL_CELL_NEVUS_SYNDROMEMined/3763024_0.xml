<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome is fairly rare and its importance derives from the fact that it is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell epithelioma</z:hpo> type that are often highly invasive as well as dysontogenic lesions affecting many organs and systems (mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>cerebral calcifications</z:hpo>, etc.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of personal experience and in view of the essentially constant evolution of individual lesions into invasive forms (that were certainly the direct cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in two of the six patients), early treatment is considered to be of prophylactic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best treatment is thought to be diathermocoagulation rather than traditional surgery radiation treatment </plain></SENT>
