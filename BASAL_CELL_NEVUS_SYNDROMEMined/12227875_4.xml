<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and compliance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36704">imiquimod</z:chebi> 5% cream for the treatment of sBCCs and nodular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> (nBCCs) in patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS/METHODS: Three patients (two male, one female) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (five sBCCs and four nBCCs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ranging in size from 0.5 cm to 1 cm, were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted for sBCCs of three weekly applications and for nBCCs of five weekly applications for 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was performed at the beginning and at the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, similar-appearing lesions were removed for baseline histological confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was performed at 1-week intervals in order to carefully detect any change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three sBCCs cleared clinically after 4 weeks of treatment and two nBCCs after 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining four lesions showed excellent clinical responses with evident (&gt;50%) size reduction at 6 weeks, but no further improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Histological examination with multiple-step sections confirmed complete clearing for those lesions showing clinical resolution, except for one nBCC that showed scant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> remnants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Local adverse effects (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">itching</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>) were mild and did not prompt discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No systemic side effects were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36704">Imiquimod</z:chebi> 5% cream is an effective therapeutic option for both sBCC and nBCC in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The treatment was very well received by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients engaged in the study, who stated their appreciation for a topical treatment rather than multiple surgical excisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A higher number of applications and longer treatment periods are required for nBCCs </plain></SENT>
