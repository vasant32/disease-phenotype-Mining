<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Five cases with multiple jaw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> from two families, and two other unrelated patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0010603'>keratocysts of the jaws</z:hpo> were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patinets whose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> had been examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were also several follicular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> without keratinization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> there was even a pronounced proliferation of the basal cells, which resembled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>Basal cell carcinomas</z:hpo> were seen in only three patients, apparently because the series had been selected for the presence of multiple jaw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, two patients with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000995'>pigmented nevi</z:hpo> showed a marked proliferation of the basal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase was noted in four out of five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sella turcica was bridged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient and fusion of the vertebrae was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000772'>rib anomalies</z:hpo>, frontal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000242'>parietal bossing</z:hpo>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000303'>mandibular prognathism</z:hpo> and dural calcification was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, what is called the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome may be regarded as a skeletal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the family pedigrees, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant inheritance</z:hpo> with poor penetration seems probable </plain></SENT>
