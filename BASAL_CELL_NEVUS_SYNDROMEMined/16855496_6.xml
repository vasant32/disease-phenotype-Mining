<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cross-sectional review and retrospective data collection of 39 patients with BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients from the BCNS support group were invited to be examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, presenting features, associated pathologies, and treatment modalities were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic data, age at presentation, age at diagnosis, spectrum of ophthalmic and periocular disease, treatment modalities used, and periocular deformities developed were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were included with age range of 5 to 72 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presenting clinical features included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocyst</z:e> in 17 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> in 13 patients; less common presentations were with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> (n = 2), with ophthalmic associations (n = 3), and at genetic counseling (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of the 39 patients confirmed a parental diagnosis of BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>Basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> developed in 18 of the 28 patients before the age of 30, confirming the reported early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> was reported in 24 of 39 patients (61%), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> reported in 17 of these 24 (71%), despite a variety of treatment modalities used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Associated ophthalmic features were multiple eyelid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> (15 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> (9 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> (5 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000540'>hyperopia</z:hpo> (7 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> (5 patients), myelinated nerve fibers (3 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> (3 patients), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> and iris transillumination defects (2 patients each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were involved in multidisciplinary medical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BCNS frequently have ophthalmic manifestations, particularly periocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multidisciplinary care is essential in the care of the patient with BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of BCNS may allow for skin protection and surveillance at an earlier age </plain></SENT>
