<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 20-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate methods of treatment and recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine patients were identified with an average age at presentation of 39.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molar region of either the mandible or maxilla was the principal primary location; the maxillary antrum was also a common site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were unilocular and associated with adjacent dentition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial therapy was typically enucleation with or without extraction of associated teeth; seven cases of recurrent or second primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocysts</z:e> required more extensive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 1 to 15 years with an average duration of 4.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall recurrence rate was 35%, and the average time to recurrence 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A recurrence rate of 60% was documented for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome or a family history thereof </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up is necessary following initial OKC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The high rate of recurrence in patients with documented or suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome suggests the need for more aggressive initial surgical management in this selected patient population </plain></SENT>
