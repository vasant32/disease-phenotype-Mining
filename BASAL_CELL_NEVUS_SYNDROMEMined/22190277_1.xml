<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the availability of comparative genomic hybridization arrays, increasing numbers of individuals with microdeletions involving this locus are being identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present 10 previously unreported individuals with 9q22.3 deletions that include PTCH1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While 7 of the 10 patients (7 females, 3 males) did not meet strict clinical criteria for BCNS at the time of molecular diagnosis, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients were too young to exhibit many of the diagnostic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A number of the patients exhibited metopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, severe obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo>, which are not typically observed in BCNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals older than a few months of age also had developmental delays and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>intellectual disability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only facial features typical of BCNS, except in those with prominent midforeheads secondary to metopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, were shared among the 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The deletions in these individuals ranged from 352  kb to 20.5  Mb in size, the largest spanning 9q21.33 through 9q31.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant overlap of the deleted segments among most of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The smallest common regions shared among the deletions were identified in order to localize putative candidate genes that are potentially responsible for each of the non-BCNS features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These were a 929  kb region for metopic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, a 1.08  Mb region for obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, and a 1.84  Mb region for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001520'>macrosomia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are needed to further characterize the candidate genes within these regions </plain></SENT>
