<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We discuss the outcome of 2 well-established and widely accepted methods used for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">odontogenic keratocyst</z:e> (OKC), enucleation with peripheral ostectomy or resection and decompression followed by enucleation and peripheral ostectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of OKC treated in the University of Maryland's Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery between 1994 and 2004 was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 31 patients with OKCs was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome and multiple OKCs and 6 patients who did not have adequate follow-up were excluded from this study; thus, 22 patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these 22 patients, 11 were treated with resection or enucleation with peripheral ostectomy (group I) and 11 were treated with decompression followed by enucleation when indicated (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 22 patients with biopsy-proven OKC ranging in age from 18 to 90 years were separated into 2 treatment arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group I comprised 6 females and 5 males, age 18 to 71 years, with 6 OKCs located in the mandible and 5 in the maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group II comprised 6 females and 5 males, age 24 to 90 years, with 10 OKCs in the mandible and 1 in the maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The choice of treatment approach was based on the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath>, recurrence status, and radiographic evidence of cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The last follow-up revealed no recurrences in group I and 2 recurrences in group II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both patients with recurrence in group II had undergone enucleation of the same lesion in the past, and both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> recurred within 2 years after initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study results concur with the literature regarding recurrence rates of OKC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The aggressive nature of some OKCs necessitates equally aggressive treatment, whereas long-term follow up even for nonsyndromic patients with single lesions is of paramount importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age of the patient and the site and histological characteristics of the treated lesions were not significantly associated with the incidence of recurrence </plain></SENT>
