<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Alterations of human patched (ptc) homolog have been proven to be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome (BCNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in heterozygous ptc knockout mouse (ptc+/- mouse) were microradiologically, histologically, immunohistochemically, and genetically examined to investigate the possible role of the ptc gene and its associates in the jaw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The mandibular bones were prepared from 63 ptc+/- mice and 6 ptc+/+ mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Soft X-ray radiographs and histological sections were examined for detection of the presence of mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were immunohistochemically investigated using anti-ptc, shh, and smo antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of ptc was performed in genomic DNA from the mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six ptc+/+ mice showed no pathologic change in any examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microradiologically, ptc+/- mice did not show any apparent lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were often multiple, and were histologically detected in the alveolar bones or periodontal ligaments of the molars in 16 (25.4%) ptc+/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> were lined by thin parakeratotic stratified squamous epithelium and contained keratinized materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination showed sonic hedgehog (shh) protein mainly in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> lining epithelium, and ptc and smoothened (smo) proteins in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> lining epithelium, and surrounding fibrous connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of ptc protein in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> lining epithelium tended to be weak as compared with incisor enamel organs and gingival stratified squamous epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LOH of the ptc gene couldn't be found in lining epithelium of mandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in any ptc+/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ptc+/- mouse is a useful model of BCNS from the standpoint of occurrence of jaw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, and downregulation of ptc protein in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> lining epithelium caused by gene targeting would be associated with formation of jaw <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in ptc+/- mice </plain></SENT>
