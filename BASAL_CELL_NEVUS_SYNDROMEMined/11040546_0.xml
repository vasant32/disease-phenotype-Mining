<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe the clinical symptoms in three subjects belonging to the same family affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They emphasise that the typical triad of the syndrome (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal-cell nevus</z:hpo>, maxillary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341038" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">keratocysts</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo>) was present in the subjects examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo> were very evident in the eldest daughter, negligible in the younger daughter and absent in the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> closely related to erupting teeth were removed in the younger daughter between 1992 and 1999, whereas the basal-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nevi</z:e> were clearly prevalent compared to other pathological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authors observe that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> increased in volume much more rapidly in the daughters than in the mother: having identified the histological components of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, this phenomenon might be linked to the age of the subjects examined </plain></SENT>
