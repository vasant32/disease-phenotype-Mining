<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with large, multifocal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumors</z:e>, standard therapy with acceptable cosmetic outcomes may be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) with photosensitizing agents selectively taken up by skin provides a primary or adjunct intraoperative option for treatment of this special group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients (age range, 60-92 y) were injected with 1.0 mg/kg PHOTOFRIN (dihematoporphyrin derivative) followed 60 hours later by intraoperative laser light activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Light was delivered through microlens fiber by means of an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> dye laser at 630 nm at a light dose of 100 to 300 J/cm2 microlens delivery for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> alone and 50 to 100 J/cm2 microlens delivery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> bed resection sites in the case of adjunct <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> combined with surgical resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve cases of aggressive recurrent nonmelanomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037286" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cutaneous tumors</z:e> of the head and neck were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients received intraoperative <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> combined with surgical resection, including radical mastoidectomy, lateral temporal bone resection, partial maxillectomy with temporalis myofacial flap reconstruction, and wide local resection with secondary intention healing of exposed scalp wounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> alone for extensive multiple cutaneous lesions or wide-field primary or recurrent nonmelanomatous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten patients achieved complete responses (follow-up, 6-60 mo) with excellent wound healing and cosmetic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PHOTOFRIN-mediated <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> is an excellent locoregional oncological modality for aggressive primary or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, particularly in elderly patients who were previously treated with extensive Mohs microsurgery, surgical resection, and external-beam radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Multiple repeat treatments are well tolerated, painless, without systemic morbidity, and amenable to local anesthesia or intravenous sedation for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> alone, and wound healing and cosmetic outcomes are excellent </plain></SENT>
