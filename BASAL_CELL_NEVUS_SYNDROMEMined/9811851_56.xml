<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The multitransmembrane protein Patched (PTCH) is the receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), a secreted molecule implicated in the formation of embryonic structures and in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current models suggest that binding of Shh to PTCH prevents the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> inhibition of the seven-transmembrane-protein Smoothened (SMO) by PTCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to this model, the inhibition of SMO signaling is relieved after mutational inactivation of PTCH in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, PTCH2, a molecule with sequence homology to PTCH, has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To characterize both PTCH molecules with respect to the various Hedgehog proteins, we have isolated the human PTCH2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis of PTCH and PTCH2 shows that they both bind to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hedgehog family members with similar affinity and that they can form a complex with SMO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the expression patterns of PTCH and PTCH2 do not fully overlap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While PTCH is expressed throughout the mouse embryo, PTCH2 is found at high levels in the skin and in spermatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) is expressed specifically in the testis and is required for germ cell development, it is likely that PTCH2 mediates its activity in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal localization of PTCH2 places it on chromosome 1p33-34, a region deleted in some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_310'>germ cell tumors</z:mpath>, raising the possibility that PTCH2 may be a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppressor in Dhh target cells </plain></SENT>
