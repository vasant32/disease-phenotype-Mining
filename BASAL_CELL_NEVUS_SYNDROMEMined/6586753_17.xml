<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>X-ray examination of fifty patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disorders</z:e> who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoids</z:chebi> for at least 2 years were compared with seventy-two age- and sex-matched untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differences in frequencies of defined abnormalities, which included anterior spinal ligament calcification and presence of osteophyte at two or more vertebral levels in the absence of joint space narrowing, were determined for treated and untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the entire group of treated patients was compared with the entire group of those untreated, no statistically significant differences were observed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">isotretinoin</z:chebi> at mean total dose of 150,060 mg for an average of 2.9 years is associated with a statistically significant increase in developing an associated ossifying diathesis in patients with BCNS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCC</z:e>, when compared with matched, untreated controls </plain></SENT>
