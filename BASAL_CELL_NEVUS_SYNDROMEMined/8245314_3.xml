<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome had variously sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell epitheliomas</z:hpo> (BCEs), mostly of the superficial type, on his chest, back, and lumbar areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCEs on the lumbar area were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) cream which was applied daily under occlusive dressings (ODT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> occurred in the center, but not at the periphery of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the latter regions, BCE remained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then cryosurgery (cryo) followed by topical 5-FU (cryo + 5-FU) was tried to treat the peripheral, non-eroded lesions; this caused complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens obtained 6 months after epithelization did not show any evidence of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also tried either cryo alone or cryo + 5-FU on the chest lesions, and either 5-FU alone or cryo + 5-FU on the abdominal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cryo alone or 5-FU alone could not clear BCE, but cryo + 5-FU could </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the cryo + 5-FU was the most effective of these therapies </plain></SENT>
