<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> occurs in children with genetically linked disorders, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Turcot's syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004779" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Gorlin's syndrome</z:e>, which is also called <z:hpo ids='HP_0002671'>basal cell nevus</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several genes have been implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> in children, including Patched-1 and Smoothened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The protein products of these genes function within the sonic hedgehog molecular signaling pathways, which are important in neural development and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Through analysis of several well-designed multi-institutional trials, much has been learned about the clinical factors that influence outcome in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age younger than 3 years, bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> postoperatively, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> constitute adverse prognostic features and indicate patients who are considered "high risk" for recurrence with standard therapy using 3600 cGy craniospinal radiation in conjunction with a posterior fossa dose of 5400 cGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients lacking these features are considered "standard risk." Chemotherapeutic trials have been developed to assess the safety and efficacy of various multi-agent therapies to improve the poor results of high-risk patients and to allow reduction in the dose of radiation needed to cure standard-risk patients, which may allow a decrease in late cognitive sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, it is policy to evaluate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021432" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">posterior fossa tumors</z:e> characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> with preoperative, staging neuroimaging studies of the craniospinal axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical resection is undertaken with the goal of gross total resection </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid is obtained from a lumbar puncture done at the conclusion of the surgical resection or 2 weeks after surgery in order to determine microscopic leptomeningeal spread </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy and radiation are given as per protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The goal of current treatment approaches is to tailor therapy based on clinical risk factors, with intensification of treatment for children with high-risk disease and reduction of radiation therapy for those with standard-risk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of biologic predictors of outcome, which may further refine treatment stratification, is in progress </plain></SENT>
