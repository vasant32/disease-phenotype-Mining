<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Males had more lesions on the upper back, upper extremities, and M-zone of the face, while females had more lesions on the scalp, back, and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pigmented <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BCCs</z:e> were concentrated on the neck, upper trunk, and extremities </plain></SENT>
