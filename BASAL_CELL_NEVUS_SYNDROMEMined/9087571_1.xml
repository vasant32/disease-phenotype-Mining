<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gene responsible for this syndrome has been mapped previously to a 2 cM interval between D9S196 and D9S 180 at 9q22.3, and very recently mutations of a candidate gene in this region--the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene have been identified </plain></SENT>
