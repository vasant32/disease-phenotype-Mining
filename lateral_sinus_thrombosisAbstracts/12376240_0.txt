BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of complications of otitis media that require surgical interventions has decreased substantially over the past few years, it is a prevailing condition for which clinicians should remain vigilant. METHODS: We conducted a 3-year review [June 1998 to June 2001] in our hospital of surgical records of patients with complications of otitis media that were treated surgically. RESULTS: There were 16 patients with complications of otitis media, of which nine [56%] were intracranial; brain abscess and lateral sinus thrombosis were the most common intracranial complications. Extracranial complications were present in 15 [94%] of the patients; mastoid abscess [40%] was the most common extracranial complication. Seven [44%] patients had two or more concomitant complications. All patients with intracranial complications recovered well with no neurological deficits after aggressive antibiotic therapy and initial surgical treatment by neurosurgeons. Modified radical mastoidectomy was the most common surgical otological procedure that was performed in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive antibiotic therapy and combined management of cases by otologists and neurosurgeons are the key to reducing the morbidity and mortality of the serious complications of otitis media.
