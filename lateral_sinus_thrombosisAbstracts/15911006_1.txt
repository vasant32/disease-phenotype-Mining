OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of otitic hydrocephalus remains unclear. The use of radiological examination is very important to clarify both the diagnosis and the pathogenesis. In this article the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is discussed. PATIENTS: Two patients with the diagnosis of otitic hydrocephalus and their MRI and MRV findings are presented. RESULTS: Both of the patients presented had thrombus in their transverse sinuses pre-operatively demonstrated by MRI causing decreased flow on MRV. After the treatment blood flow through the sinus increased significantly as the symptoms subsided. CONCLUSION: MRI and MRV are valuable tools for diagnosis and follow-up of otitic hydrocephalus.
