BACKGROUND: Activated protein C resistance (APC-R) due to factor V Leiden has recently been established as an important risk factor for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). The clinical significance of abnormal or borderline functional APC-R in the absence of factor V Leiden is uncertain. Our observations suggest that APC-R due to mechanisms other than factor V Leiden may also contribute to the development of CVT. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We describe three women who had superior sagittal and lateral sinus thrombosis while taking oral contraceptives and had a number of additional risk factors for CVT. Each had APC-R for different reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Inherited thrombophilia, including APC-R, should be looked for in all patients with CVT. Functional APC-R is a highly prevalent coagulopathy, but the reasons for this abnormality are diverse; abnormal and borderline functional APC-R results should be supplemented by DNA analysis for the presence of factor V Leiden.
