Four patients with lateral sinus thrombosis were studied by radionuclide (RN) dynamic studies and RN static brain scans. Findings included: (a) abrupt termination of RN activity in the midportion of a lateral sinus ("stump sign"); (b) nonvisualization on dynamic, increased visualization on static images ipsilateral to a prominent sinus groove on a plain skull radiograph; and (c) increased activity on static images with nonfilling on angiography. RN demonstration of the "stump sign" is pathognomonic of lateral sinus occlusion; the latter two patterns require radiographic demonstration of an ipsilateral sinus groove or angiography for significance.
