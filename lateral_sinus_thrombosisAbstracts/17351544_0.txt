INTRODUCTION: Severe pulmonary tuberculosis may be complicated by deep vein thrombosis due to a state of hypercoagulability. OBSERVATION: We report a case of pulmonary miliary tuberculosis associated with cerebral venous thrombosis and multiple intracranial tuberculomas. A 65-year-old woman developed a confusional syndrome one week after starting treatment for pulmonary military tuberculosis. Neuroimaging reveals a thrombus in the right lateral sinus and multiple silent intracranial tuberculoma. CONCLUSION: The patient was given anticoagulants and fully recovered.
