Lateral sinus thrombosis complicating head and neck infections is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.We report 4 pediatric cases of lateral sinus thrombosis occurring in different settings (2 patients with acute otitis media, 1 patient with chronic otitis media, and another with acute tonsillitis) to emphasize the nonspecific clinical presentation of this complication. In all our cases, early diagnosis was missed.Keeping a high index of suspicion when dealing with these infections is a reasonable approach.
