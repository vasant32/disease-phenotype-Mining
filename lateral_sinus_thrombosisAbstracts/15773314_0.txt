A 43-year-old male with respiratory arrest due to neck hanging was resuscitated at the scene. The head CT on arrival showed diffuse brain swelling predominantly in the right cerebral hemisphere. The swelling improved but right transverse sinus thrombosis was recognized on the 4th hospital day. His conscious state gradually recovered and recanalization of the sinus was confirmed on a subsequent MR venography. He was discharged without neurological deficit. A sinus thrombosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis of brain swelling after hanging.
