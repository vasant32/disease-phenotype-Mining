Behçet's disease is a multisystemic vasculitis characterized by the association of recurrent oral and genital ulcers with systemic involvements, particularly ocular, nervous and vascular manifestations. The association of Behçet's disease and aids/HIV infection is rare. The role of HIV infection in the pathomechanism of both diseases is unclear. We report a 28-year-old HIV-positive patient who presented Behçet's disease complicated by deep vein thrombosis and left lateral sinus thrombosis. This rare association raises questions about the etiopathogenic process and therapeutic management.
