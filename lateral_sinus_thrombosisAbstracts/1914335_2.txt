A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of headache and fever. Four months before admission, he had suffered from thrombophlebitis of the legs, erythema, oral aphtha and genital ulcers, and was diagnosed as having Behçet disease. Several days prior to admission he developed fever and was treated with enoxacine, which caused disorientation and abnormal behavior. These psychiatric symptoms disappeared after enoxacine was discontinued. On admission he was neurologically normal. Fever and headache disappeared spontaneously. However, he complained again of headache, and was suspected to have cerebral sinus thrombosis. Brain CT scan showed no abnormality, but brain MRI and cerebral angiography demonstrated right transverse sinus thrombosis and stasis. He was treated with colchicine, isosorbide, and ticlopidine. Because he had a gastric ulcer, corticosteroids were not indicated. Two months later, brain MRI demonstrated reduction of the size of the sinus thrombosis, and the clinical outcome was favorable. We would like to emphasize the usefulness of MRI and colchicine in the patient with Behçet disease complicated by sinus thromboses.
