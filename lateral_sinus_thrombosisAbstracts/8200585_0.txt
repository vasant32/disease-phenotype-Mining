Lateral sinus thrombophlebitis (LST) is an intracranial complication of otitis media. Its incidence has markedly decreased in the era of antibiotic therapy but mortality is still high. A 13-year-old girl presented with fever, ear discharge and torticollis. On the day of admission LST was diagnosed from the clinical presentation and CT-scan. She was operated immediately and intravenous antibiotics were administered. Despite the rapid intervention, the course was protracted, with recurrent events of septic pulmonary embolism. Despite internal jugular vein ligation, fever continued and anticoagulant therapy was begun. The possibility of LST should be considered in patients with ear discharge and fever. CT-scan enables early diagnosis of LST and MRI has a role in detecting additional intracranial septal foci. Surgical intervention should be early and aggressive. The efficacy of jugular vein ligation is unclear; anticoagulant therapy should be considered.
