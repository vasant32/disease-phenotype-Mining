We report a case of transverse sinus thrombosis accompanied by colon and rectal double cancers. A 48-year-old male transferred to our department from the division of surgery due to deterioration manifested by headache after colectomy and low anterior resection of the rectum. There was bilateral papilledema and right upper homonymous hemianopsia. On admission all the laboratory data were within normal range. CT showed a left temporal mass lesion of heterogeneous density, which was suspected as being intratumorous hematoma in a metastasis. MRI revealed a left transverse sinus thrombosis. The left transverse and sigmoid sinuses were not opacified, but angiography showed that the occipital and marginal sinuses seemed to be markedly developed. Evacuation of the subcortical hematoma was carried out. Histologically, it was a mixed hematoma in acute and chronic stages without any carcinoma component or vascular malformation. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was returned to the division of surgery in order to follow up the cancer 2 weeks after operation. Angiography 4 months after operation showed almost no recanalization in the left transverse sinus. Further, development of the collateral flow and the double occipital sinus was opacified. Because the coagulation system is often activated by the presence of cancer, it is important to distinguish intracerebral hemorrhage due to sinus thrombosis from intratumorous hemorrhage within a metastatic tumor.
