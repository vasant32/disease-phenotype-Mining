INTRODUCTION: Extraoral craniofacial implants are often used for retention of auricular prostheses. In this case report, the rare complication of sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis after implant placement in the mastoid is described. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old man with congenital hypoplasia of the right ear was treated with an implant-based auricular prosthesis. One of the three implants in the mastoid area had to be removed because of an infection, whereas the other two implants were removed at the patient's request. Twenty-four days after implant removal, he was seen with sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis and successfully treated with fibrinolytic and consecutive anticoagulation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Implants in the mastoid area are a very important aid for retention of auricular prostheses, but may have life-threatening intracranial consequences.
