The two primary symptoms of chronic ear disease are otorrhea and hearing loss. The goal of any tympanoplasty is to eradicate disease and improve hearing. These are the primary indications for this procedure. The success or failure of the surgery is influenced by many factors such as the age and general health of the patient, the extent and type of disease present, and whether the upper airway is functioning properly. Contraindications to tympanoplasty will vary from one surgeon to another depending upon his training, philosophy, experience, and surgical skill. It is helpful to think of these contraindications as being either absolute or relative. Absolute contraindications consist of: 1. uncontrolled cholesteatoma; 2. malignant tumors; 3. unusual infections and/or extenuating circumstances; and 4. complications of chronic ear disease, such as meningitis, brain abscess, or lateral sinus thrombosis. Relative contraindications are less well defined: 1. eustachian tube insufficiency or non-function; 2. the uncooperative patient; 3. the dead ear; 4. the better hearing or only hearing ear; 5. the elderly patient; 6. the young child; and 7. the repeated failure case. The otologic surgeon must exercise good clinical judgment in selecting patients for tympanoplasty. This paper deals with some of the more common problems in decision making.
