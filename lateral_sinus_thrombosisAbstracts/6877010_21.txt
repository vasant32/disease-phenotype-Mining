Among 334,884 admissions to the North Carolina Baptist Hospital from 1963 through 1982, 100 patients had central nervous system (CNS) complications of middle ear disease. The complications occurred predominantly in young patients, 85 of the 100 being less than 20 years of age. Meningitis occurred in 76 patients; the acute form was more prevalent (63 cases). The less common nonmeningitic complications included brain abscess (n = 6), effusion (n = 5), lateral sinus thrombosis (n = 5), otitic hydrocephalus (n = 5), and empyema (n = 3). Overall mortality was 10%. One patient with brain abscess died; 9 of the 76 patients with meningitis died (12%), with 4 of those deaths occurring among the 13 patients with chronic meningitis (31%). Because these complications have declined markedly since the advent of antibiotics, many contemporary otolaryngologists have been unexposed to these complications. However, as this series shows, they do still occur, their natural history remains the same, and the resulting mortality is still alarmingly high. A plea is made for otolaryngologists to maintain an awareness of these complications and to work with pediatricians and neurosurgeons for the best team care of patients with CNS complications of middle ear disease.
