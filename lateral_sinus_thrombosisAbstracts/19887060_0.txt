A 16-year-old girl was diagnosed with widely distributed dural sinus thrombosis (DST) and a haemorrhagic infarct in the left parietal lobe. Despite of heparin treatment, pronounced aggravation of symptoms was observed. Through a femoral vein approach a micro-catheter was advanced into the superior sagittal sinus and rt-PA was infused slowly, directly into the thrombus over 24 hours. A follow up angiogram showed recanalisation of sinus. The patient recovered almost completely, with only few remaining cognitive symptoms. This treatment remains experimental, but should be kept in mind for DST-patients unresponsive to heparin treatment.
