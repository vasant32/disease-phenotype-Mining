CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man presented a clinical picture characterized by lymphocytic meningoencephalitis, visual loss in both eyes and transverse sinus thrombosis. This picture was treated with prednisone and anticoagulation. Fundus examination showed complete occlusive arteritis, periphlebitis, peripheral ischemia and perfusion macular defects affecting both eyes. The picture was suggestive of Behçet's disease. Azathioprine was added to the treatment without improvement in visual acuity. Four months later oral aphthous ulcers developed, confirming the suspected diagnosis. DISCUSSION: Behçet's disease may appear with the sudden onset of visual loss secondary to massive occlusive retinal vasculitis. The critical state of neuro-Behçet disease may delay the diagnosis. This combination of visual and neurological symptoms is associated with a poor visual prognosis (Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol 2002; 77: 275-278).
