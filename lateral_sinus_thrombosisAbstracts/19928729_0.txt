The authors describe a 34-year-old woman who presented with headaches and marked papilledema after she had been taking oral hormonal therapy for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Neurological examination led to the diagnosis of a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. After thrombolytic treatment, the headaches vanished and the papilledema in the right eye disappeared. Visual acuity increased to 20/25 in the right eye and 20/32 in the left eye. However, the marked papilledema in the left eye had resulted in a pronounced contraction of the posterior vitreous at the optic nerve head associated with a secondary folding of the macula and subretinal pigmentary irregularities in the foveal region.
