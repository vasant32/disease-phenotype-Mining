The clinical course of three patients who had combined sagittal and lateral sinus dural fistulae is described. One patient, with impending blindness and a short life span, underwent right lateral sinus thrombosis in one stage. The second patient underwent sagittal and right lateral sinus thrombosis in four stages, and her remaining lateral sinus spontaneously occluded. A small untreated fistula persists in the right lower sigmoid. The third patient underwent sagittal sinus, left lateral sinus, and left parietal sinus thrombosis in six stages. A small untreated far-anterior fistula persists. All "satellite" fistulae have spontaneously disappeared. The small asymptomatic untreated residual fistulae have no demonstrable retrograde venous drainage and, therefore, require no treatment at this time.
