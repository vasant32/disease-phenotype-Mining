The incidence of intracranial complications of otogenic disease has been altered dramatically since the discovery of antibiotics. However, with the reduction in complications, young otologists have become less aware of these potential catastrophic problems Meningitis continues to be the most frequent intracranial complication, followed by brain abscesses and lateral sinus thrombosis.

This paper attempts to review the literature on the occurrence, pathologic factors, symptoms, and treatment of meningitis, brain abscess, and lateral sinus thrombosis secondary to otogenic disease.
