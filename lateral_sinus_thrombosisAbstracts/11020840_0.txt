Two patients with cerebral sinus thrombosis were successfully treated with neuroradiological intervention procedures, one with local thrombolysis and the other with mechanical thrombosuction using a hydrolyser catheter. The first patient, a 20-year-old woman, was treated with asparaginase for acute lymphatic leukaemia. She lapsed into coma with extensor posturing due to superior sagittal and right transverse sinus thrombosis. She recovered completely after local thrombolysis with 2,940,000 units urokinase, administered over a period of 40 hours. The second patient was a 29-year-old man who presented with clinical deterioration after seizures due to superior sagittal, left transverse and straight sinus thrombosis. A CT-scan demonstrated bilateral haemorrhagic cerebral infarctions. Since the risk of haemorrhage during thrombolysis with urokinase was considered to be high, mechanical thrombosuction with a hydrolyser catheter was performed. This procedure took only 4 hours. The patient recovered completely in two weeks. These cases add further evidence to the effectiveness of thrombolysis and thrombosuction in selected patients with severe cerebral sinus thrombosis.
