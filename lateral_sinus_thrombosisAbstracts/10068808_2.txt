BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis is a clinical entity which is readily diagnosed with the advent of modern imaging techniques. Anticoagulation is now a standard therapy, but more recent treatment strategies have included endovascular thrombolysis. While the endpoint of this intervention both clinically and radiographically has not been defined, noninvasive monitoring techniques may add further objective measures of treatment response. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a patient with a four day history of worsening headache and papilledema on exam. Superior sagittal, straight, and bilateral transverse sinus thromboses were identified on computed tomography and angiography. INTERVENTION: Emergent endovascular thrombolysis by a transvenous approach re-established venous patency and resulted in immediate resolution of the patient's symptoms. Cerebral oximetry by near-infrared spectroscopy was utilized during the procedure, and changes in chromophore concentrations correlated directly with angiographic and clinical resolution of the thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Near-infrared spectroscopy can provide continuous feedback during thrombolytic therapy in cerebral venous thrombosis and may help define endpoints of such intervention.
