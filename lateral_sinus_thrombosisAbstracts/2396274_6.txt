Lateral sinus thrombosis may be difficult to differentiate angiographically from lateral sinus hypoplasia, which mainly affects its proximal transverse portion. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated six patients who demonstrated poor filling or lack of filling of one or both lateral sinuses at angiography. In each patient, magnetic resonance imaging unambiguously demonstrated either lateral sinus thrombosis or lateral sinus hypoplasia. The latter was characterized by a frank asymmetry in size (surface of section) of the transverse portion of the lateral sinuses on parasagittal images without any abnormal signal in the course of the sinus. Lateral sinus thrombosis was indicated by increased intraluminal signal on all planes and with all pulse sequences. By virtue of its freedom from bone-related artifact, its multiplanar imaging capability, and its sensitivity to both blood flow and thrombus formation, magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent tool for the evaluation of lateral sinus thrombosis or hypoplasia.
