Nonseptic lateral sinus thrombosis (NSLST) differs from septic lateral thrombosis (SLST) in that it is not associated with ear or sinus infection, it usually occurs in the adult population, and it has an ambiguous clinical presentation. The otolaryngologist is often consulted about diagnostic findings associated with lateral sinus thrombosis. We report three cases of NSLST that required otolaryngologic assessment. The patients were women, ages 23 to 31 years. Presenting symptoms were headaches in all three patients; one also had concomitant ear pain. Two patients had negative head computed tomography scans; only magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic. Treatment of NSLST consists of anticoagulation and elimination of predisposing factors. Familiarity with this condition is fundamental for early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy. We discuss the origins and causes of NSLST, clinical presentation, preferred diagnostic strategy, and treatment alternatives.
