Of 1321 patients with intracranial (IC) infection studied, the infection occurred as a direct result of middle ear disease in 36 (3%). The presenting clinical symptoms were those of diffuse meningeal irritation in 23 and of localized infection in the remaining 13. In the 23 patients with diffuse meningitis, the IC infection followed Acute Suppurative Otitis Media (ASOM) in only four and followed Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) in the remaining 19. Five of these 23 patients died soon after admission as their general condition was very severe. The final diagnosis in the 13 patients with localized meningeal inflammation was, brain abscess in seven, extradural abscess in four, lateral sinus thrombosis in two. All these patients underwent surgery, and except for one patient who died 3 days post-operative all recovered without sequelae.
