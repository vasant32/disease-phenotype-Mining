Whilst cerebral vascular disease and mental illness in the post-partum period are well recognised, their co-existence and the concept of organic psychoses in pregnancy, parturition and the puerperium remains poorly appreciated (Brockington 2006; Brockington Arch Women's Ment Health 10: 177-178, 2007a; Brockington Arch Women's Ment Health 10: 305-306, b). We report a woman who was referred to the Medical team on-call with a mixed presentation of euphoria, mutism and aggressive behaviour but ultimately demonstrated to have a transverse sinus thrombosis and recovered well with anti-coagulation. This serves an important reminder of the implications of a missed medical diagnosis in this high-risk and vulnerable group of patients.
