Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the older is most often due to aneurismal rupture. Other vascular lesions are known to rarely cause SAH. Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can be difficult to diagnose because of its wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Its diagnosis can be further complicated when patients initially present with acute SAH. We report a case of dural venous sinus thrombosis with SAH, most probably, due to raised venous pressure draining venous tributaries. A 59-year-old man presented with severe headache. Computerized tomography (CT) scan head was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested right parasagittal fronto-parietal hemorrhage. No aneurysm was detected on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MRV revealed superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and lateral sinus thrombosis. DSA showed occlusion of intracranial SSS and lateral venous sinus. The patient improved with anticoagulant therapy. This case highlights the fact that SAH may reveal a CVT, and emphasizes on the inclusion of MRV in the diagnostic workup of SAH, particularly in cases in which aneurysm is not detected.
