Objective:               We report lateral sinus thrombosis occurring as a rare complication following a routine and uneventful otological procedure.                                       Case report:               Lateral sinus thrombosis is a rare but known complication of otitis media. It has not been documented as a complication of routine otological surgery. We present a case of this rare complication following a myringoplasty. We also discuss the presentation, investigation and treatment of lateral sinus thrombosis. It is essential to be able to recognise and treat this rare complication early, due to its high mortality rate.                                       Conclusion:               Lateral sinus thrombosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. It is therefore essential for clinicians to be able to recognise and treat this condition early.
