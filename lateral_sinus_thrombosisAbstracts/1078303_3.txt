Two cases with thrombosis of the transverse sinus caused by a fracture crossing the sinus are reported, and the roentgenological changes seen in cerebral angiography are discussed. In 1 case, a filling defect was seen which at subsequent autopsy was found to correspond with an intraluminal thrombosis. In the other case, not verified at autopsy, the angiographic changes were consistent with a thrombosis of a transverse sinus.
