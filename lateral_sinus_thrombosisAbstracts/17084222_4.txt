OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to review our experience on intracranial complications secondary to otitis media (OM), and to compare the results to those occurring 10-15 years ago. We also reviewed the timing of both otologic and neurosurgical treatments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with intracranial complications secondary to OM over a 7-year period were identified. A retrospective chart review was undertaken at Beaumont University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Clinical presentation, radiological findings, microbiology, surgical management, and antibiotic use were studied. We compare our findings to those of other international investigators. RESULTS: Twelve cases were identified. Five had brain abscesses, 4 had lateral sinus thrombosis, and 3 had petrous apicitis. Eight of these cases were secondary to chronic OM and 4 were secondary to acute OM. Malodorous otorrhea, otalgia, headache, fever, and vertigo were the primary symptoms. Anaerobic bacteria were the most commonly isolated organisms followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with cholesteatoma underwent modified radical or radical mastoidectomy, and those who did not have cholesteatoma underwent cortical mastoidectomy. Two brain abscesses were drained before mastoid surgery; 2 were drained after mastoid surgery and 1 at the same time as otologic surgery. All patients received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeted at individual culture and sensitivity results. The mortality rate was zero. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation and the frequency of occurrence of intracranial complications are similar to those occurring 10 years ago. The choice of antibiotics should include adequate anaerobic cover. We recommend that otologic surgery be performed at the same time as intracranial surgery for patients with mature brain abscesses.
