In spite of significant decrease after antibiotic advent, intracranial complications of otitis media still represent a challenging situation owing to its high mortality rate (36%). The most common presentations are meningitis, cerebral abscess, extradural abscess and lateral sinus thrombophlebitis. For early management, it is necessary to have a high index of suspicion. It is important to identify non-typical cases because they might be masqueraded by antibiotic use. AIM: We present six cases of intracranial complications due to otitis media in children and adolescents at Complexo Hospitalar Santa Casa de Porto Alegre for the past two years. STUDY DESIGN: Series review.
