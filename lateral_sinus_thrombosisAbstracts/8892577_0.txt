The pathogenesis of otitic hydrocephalus still remains doubtful. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis in two consecutive patients. The role of MRI in the diagnosis and pathogenesis of this complication, together with literature findings, is discussed. Until now, lumbar puncture, which is a minimally invasive technique, was the only diagnostic measure. MRI, however, can be used to establish the diagnosis of otitic hydrocephalus by showing the thrombosis in the sigmoid and transverse sinus.
