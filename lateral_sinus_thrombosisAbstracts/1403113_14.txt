Intracranial dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas with spinal perimedullary venous drainage are rare lesions that have distinctive clinical, radiological, and therapeutic aspects. Five patients presented with an ascending myelopathy, which extended to involve the brain stem in three cases. Myelography and magnetic resonance imaging showed slightly dilated spinal perimedullary vessels. Spinal angiograms were normal in the arterial phase. Diagnosis was only possible after cerebral angiography, which demonstrated posterior fossa AV fistulas fed by meningeal arteries and draining into spinal perimedullary veins. Endovascular treatment alone resulted in angiographic obliteration of the lesion in three patients. Two patients required surgery in addition to endovascular therapy. One patient died postoperatively, and in one a transient complication of embolization was observed. Improvement after treatment was good in two cases and fair in two. Transverse sinus thrombosis was observed in three cases and was probably the cause of the aberrant venous drainage of the fistula into the spinal perimedullary veins. The pathophysiology is related to spinal cord venous hypertension. These lesions were classified as Type 5 in the Djindjian and Merland classification of dural intracranial AV fistulas. Endovascular therapy is a safe effective method in the treatment of these fistulas and should be tried first.
