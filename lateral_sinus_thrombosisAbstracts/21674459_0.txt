A retrospective study was undertaken to review the clinical presentation, evaluation, management, and outcome of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) in children. All pediatric patients with LST seen in our department between 1999 and 2007 were included; there were 9 cases involving 6 boys and 3 girls whose ages ranged from 8 to 12 years. They had all been treated with antibiotics elsewhere prior to admission, and the duration of symptoms before admission ranged from 5 to 18 days. The most common presenting symptoms were ear discharge, headache, otalgia, and fever. Radiologic evaluation included computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent radical mastoidectomy with incision of the lateral sinus and removal of its content. There were no deaths. Pseudomonas and Proteus spp were the most commonly identified organisms. Otogenic LST still poses a serious threat that warrants immediate attention and care. It is often associated with other intracranial complications, such as cerebellar abscess. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in the management of this disease. Early and aggressive surgical intervention of this otogenic complication can potentially minimize mortality.
