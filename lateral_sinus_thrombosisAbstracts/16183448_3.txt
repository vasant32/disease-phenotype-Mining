A 19-year-old woman, 8 days postpartum, presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint of headache, decreased vision, and agitation. Past medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination was remarkable only for dry mucous membranes, decreased visual acuity, and trace pedal edema bilaterally. While in the ED, the patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was suspicious for venous infarction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR venography revealed sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus thrombosis. The risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of cerebral venous thrombosis are reviewed.
