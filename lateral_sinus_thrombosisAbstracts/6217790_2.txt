Continuous polymicrobial anaerobic septicemia was the main manifestation of a lateral sinus thrombophlebitis (LST) in a patient who had a history of chronic otitis media. Five different anaerobic microorganisms were isolated in blood cultures. Three of them were also present in ear cultures. The diagnosis was confirmed at surgery and the patient was successfully treated with moxalactam disodium therapy. This case emphasizes that LST should be considered before polymicrobial anaerobic septicemia, especially if there is a history of chronic otitis media.
