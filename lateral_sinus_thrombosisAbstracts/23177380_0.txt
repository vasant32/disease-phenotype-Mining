OBJECTIVES: A case of pediatric otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis is reported, followed by a substantive literature review. DESIGN: 104 patients were reviewed, culled from published case reports from 1993 to 2011 on the PubMed database. METHODS: All full text case reports on the PubMed database from 1993 to 2011 with patients less than or equal to 16 years of age that outlined specific treatments were included. RESULTS: 73% of patients were male and average age of presentation was 7.7 years. The most common symptoms were fever, headache, and otalgia, while the most common signs included otorrhea and neck stiffness. CT scans had a sensitivity of 87% and MR studies had a sensitivity of 100%. Single bacterial organisms were isolated in 46% of cases, with beta hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus being most common. Management included broad spectrum antibiotics (100%), mastoidectomy (94%), manipulation of the thrombosed sinus (50%), and anticoagulation (57%). The mortality rate was one in 104 patients. Morbidities occurred in 10% of patients and included cranial nerve palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, stroke, and septic hip joint. CONCLUSION: Lateral sinus thrombosis is a rare but treatable complication of otologic disease in the pediatric population, warranting a high index of suspicion. Management should include broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical removal of all perisinus infection. Anticoagulation is not definitively associated with improved outcomes and warrants further investigation.
