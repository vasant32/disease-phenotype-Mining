Twelve cases of lateral sinus thrombosis, which occurred as a complication of attico antral type of chronic otitis media, are reported. Management includes broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and surgery. Radical mastoidectomy with incision of the lateral sinus and removal of its content was done for all cases. There were no deaths. The prognosis of lateral sinus thrombosis is good if treatment is instituted early with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgery.
