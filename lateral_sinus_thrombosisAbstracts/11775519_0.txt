Intracranial complications of acute and chronic otitis media can be difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms are often subtle. This article describes a case of one such complication--sigmoid sinus thrombosis--that was manifested by a contralateral abducens palsy. The author believes that this is the first reported case of such an occurrence. This article also reviews the differential diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure and discusses the recognition and management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
