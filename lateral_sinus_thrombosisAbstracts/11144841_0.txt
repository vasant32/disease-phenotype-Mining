Otitic hydrocephalus is characterized by increased intra-cranial pressure without focal signs of neurological dysfunction. It usually occurs secondary to lateral sinus thrombosis more commonly on the right side, but it can also occur without lateral sinus thrombosis. With the advent of new antibiotics there has been a spectacular decrease in the complications of otitis media. Otogenic intra-cranial hypertension, always an uncommon condition, is seen only very rarely nowadays. Tubercular otitis media still occurs in India, and due to delays in its diagnosis it usually presents with complications. We present three patients with otitic hydrocephalus of tubercular origin.
