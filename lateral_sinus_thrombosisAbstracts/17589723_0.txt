Otogenous lateral sinus thrombosis (OLST) is a rare disease and presents a controversial treatment. AIM: Clinical aspects and treatment were reported based on our experience. METHODS: Retrospective study. Six cases of OLST were treated in our institution in the last ten years. Clinical and imaging data were analyzed. RESULTS: All six patients had the lateral sinus thrombosis detected during image evaluation for other symptoms related to chronic otitis media (COM) complications. Fever, headache and facial paralysis were the main clinical manifestation related to mastoiditis, meningitis and cerebellar abscess. We could not identify, in any case, specific features of lateral sinus thrombosis. In all cases a mastoidectomy was associated with large spectrum antibiotics maintained for 3 months. In three cases anticoagulation therapy was introduced and in three cases anticoagulation was not indicated. All cases presented a good clinical evolution, without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: OLST is almost always associated with other complications of COM. It is diagnosed almost by accident during the investigative image study. We believe such disease is underestimated. In our experience, OLST presents a benign course, and mastoidectomy with antibiotics is the treatment of choice.
