Nonseptic lateral sinus thrombosis differs from septic lateral sinus thrombosis in that it is not associated with ear or sinus infection. Mastoid changes are frequently detected on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in cases of nonseptic lateral sinus thrombosis. An otolaryngologic evaluation is usually required to exclude coexisting mastoiditis.
