<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using laser-Doppler flowmetry, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity of cortical cerebral vessels and l-CoBF were measured continuously in five patients at the local surgical field of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Local-CoBF values obtained during the normocapnic condition varied from site to site of gyrus in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region (0-73 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>100 g(-1).min(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local-CoBF was maximal at 39-43 mmHg of the PaCO(2) range, and decreased above and below this range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response of l-CoBF to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> was larger at the sites where the maximal level was obtained during normocapnia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients, l-CoBF decreased by about 50%, and remained law even 40 min after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, l-CoBF values obtained during the normocapnic condition varied from site to site of gyrus, and not only <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> but also <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> decreased l-CoBF within the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> region </plain></SENT>
