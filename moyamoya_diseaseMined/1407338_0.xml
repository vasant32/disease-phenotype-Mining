<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, we can obtain images of vessels (angiograms) without injection of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the results of phase contrast angiography on cerebral and spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We utilized the General Electric SIGNA, 1.5 tesla NMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-one cases of cerebral and spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> were scanned using phase contrast angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Included were 90 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo>, 16 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 39 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, and 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The phase contrast angiography uses flow encoding gradient pulses, which impart a velocity-dependent phase shift to the transverse magnetization of moving spins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting image contains only information from the moving spins; while information from stationary tissue remains suppressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cases using 3-D angiogram, we made 32 images 6 degrees apart in their projection direction and displayed them on a video terminal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We were able to visualize occlusions of vessels, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, bypassed vessels, and abnormal vessels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Retrospective evaluation comparing phase contrast angiography with conventional angiography of the stenotic findings on the horizontal portion of middle cerebral arteries (64 vessels of 32 patients), resulted in a false positive ratio of 39.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We obtained clinically valuable results regarding the hydrodynamics of patients using "phase contrast angiography" non-invasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results reveal not only "anatomical" images of vessels, but also "functional" images, which are sensitive to the pattern of the blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study would strongly suggest that phase contrast angiography presents a valuable tool for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral and spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
