<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate high-resolution turbo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography for the diagnosis and assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-six patients suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were examined with high-resolution turbo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with the ZFI technique, MRI, and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was diagnosed in 42 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blind, separate interpretation of the images was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: High-resolution turbo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and MRI accurately evaluated 349 (95%) and 325 (88%) of 368 arteries, respectively, but the degree of stenosis was overestimated in the other arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and MRI depicted basal cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in 82 (98%) and 82 (98%) of 84 hemispheres, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography also depicted leptomeningeal and transdural collateral vessels in 51 (100%) of 51 hemispheres and in 38 (88%) of 43 hemispheres, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of high-resolution turbo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were 98% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution turbo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography in reduced scan time is highly accurate in the assessment of both steno-occlusive lesions and collateral vessels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, thus providing a highly accurate (98%) diagnosis and assessment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
