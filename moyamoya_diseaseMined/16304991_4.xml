<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> ensues due to insufficient collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One potential treatment consists of the restoration of regional cerebral blood flow by direct or indirect revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of neovascularization, especially in indirect procedures such as encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS), is currently evaluated with conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because this method is invasive and carries some risks, the authors investigated power Doppler imaging as an alternative noninvasive bedside procedure that can be used to assess surgically induced indirect revascularization in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve symptomatic patients with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (seven women and five men, mean age 38 +/- 17 years) underwent combined (direct and indirect) revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were then examined using conventional angiography and power Doppler imaging to assess the extent of revascularization within 120 days postsurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the number of intracranial vessels demonstrating opacification on conventional angiography and power Doppler imaging studies, EMS was graded as follows: 1, absent (0 vessels); 2, moderate (one-four vessels); and 3, extensive (&gt; four vessels) for both methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Examiners were blinded to the classification results for the procedure that they did not grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 24 hemispheres were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The visual grading of EMS revealed a highly significant agreement between conventional angiography and power Doppler imaging (Spearman rank coefficient, r = 0.92; p &lt; 0.001) and there was 100% agreement of patency of the bypass between the direct and indirect methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors found excellent agreement between the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, power Doppler imaging is a valid noninvasive alternative to carotid artery angiography in evaluating direct and indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
