<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies were performed in 88 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The activity of daily living (ADL) of each groups were followed up and compared between those who were surgically treated and conservatively managed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic manifestations were more common in the younger children and tended to be recurrent, whereas hemorrhagic manifestations were more common in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up duration of the 36 patients, who were surgically treated, ranged from 6 to 86.4 months (mean: 28.8 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, ADL was improved in 17 of 31 ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients (55%); the condition was unchanged in nine (29%); and aggravated in five (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up duration of the 52 patients who were managed without surgery ranged from 12 to 216 months (mean: 67.2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 35 patients of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, ADL was aggravated in 49% and improved in only 26% during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, ADL was aggravated in 12% of 17 hemorrhagic patients, but improved in 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our result suggest that indirect revascularization procedures are effective for prevention of recurrent ischemic attacks which is common in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the effectiveness of indirect revascularization for hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is not clear and requires extended follow-up study </plain></SENT>
