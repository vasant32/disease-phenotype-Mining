<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Controversy exists regarding whether direct or indirect revascularization yields better outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study involves a single-center experience with direct anastomosis and is the first North American series using direct revascularization for pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients (age range, 5-17 yr; mean age, 10.2 yr) underwent direct revascularization of 21 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients had experienced failure of previous indirect revascularization procedures, with continued clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed in 19 hemispheres (with concurrent encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis in 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Middle meningeal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and omental transposition were each performed in one hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 65 months (mean, 35 mo), and monitoring included neurological examinations, angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebral blood flow studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The neurological conditions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were stable or improved after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and no new ischemic lesions were seen in magnetic resonance imaging scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> grafts evaluated by follow-up angiography were patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral blood flow studies showed significantly improved blood flow (54.4 versus 42.5 ml/100 g/min; P = 0.017, n = 4) and hemodynamic reserve (70.3 versus 43.9 ml/100 g/min; P = 0.009, n = 4), compared with preoperative studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgical revascularization by direct anastomosis in pediatric patients is technically feasible, is well tolerated, and can improve the progressive natural history, the angiographic appearance, and the cerebral blood flow abnormalities associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Direct revascularization has the advantage of providing immediate and high-flow revascularization and is particularly useful for patients who have experienced failure of previous indirect revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
