<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Generally, the conventional 3D-TOF MRA is used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, retrobulbar and subcutaneous fat of the head show high intensity signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that using the conventional MRA to diagnose the details of brain blood flow is difficult and that it cannot differentiate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels and fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It similarly obscures the ophthalmic artery and superficial temporal artery that overlap with fat in the direction of the maximum intensity projection (MIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we devised an MRA technique with fat suppression to diagnose blood flow in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography with the principle of selective excitation technique (PROSET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scan time does not need to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We studied the TOF effect in constant and pulsatile flows and the water selective excitation method with the binominal pulse (PROSET) for the fat suppression effect for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that PROSET-MRA achieved better image results than conventional MRA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PROSET-MRA method is useful for evaluating pre- and post-operation (encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, encephalo-myo-synangiosis) blood flow reconstruction for patients who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
