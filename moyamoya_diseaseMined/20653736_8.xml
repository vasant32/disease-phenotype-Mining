<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To describe a spectrum of intracerebral large artery disease in Aicardi-Gouti√®res syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AGS</z:e>) associated with mutations in the AGS5 gene SAMHD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We used clinical and radiological description and molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five individuals (three males, two females) were identified as having biallelic mutations in SAMHD1 and a cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> in association with peripheral vessel involvement resulting in chilblains and ischaemic ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral vasculopathy was primarily occlusive in three patients (with terminal carotid occlusion and basal collaterals reminiscent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>) and aneurysmal in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the five patients experienced intracerebral haemorrhage, which was fatal in two individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-mortem examination of one patient suggested that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> was inflammatory in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with a cerebral vasculopathy which is likely to have an inflammatory aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar disease has not been observed in patients with mutations in AGS1 to AGS4, suggesting a particular role for SAMHD1 in vascular homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our report raises important questions about the management of patients with mutations in SAMHD1 </plain></SENT>
