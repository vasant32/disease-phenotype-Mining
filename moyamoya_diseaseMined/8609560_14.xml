<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had between one and four burr holes (mean 2.1) drilled in each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In four patients new burr holes were added on the opposite side after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was detected by follow-up single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography imaging of the brain with N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 6 to 62 months (mean 34.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Beginning at 6 months postsurgery, angiograms disclosed rich neovascularization at 41 of 43 burr holes, first from the middle meningeal artery, then from the superficial temporal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization did not occur at two burr holes at which there was subdural effusion and local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Progression of stenosis of the major vessels was seen in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels were decreased at six sites in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CBF study revealed that the reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> disappeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients presenting with this symptom, and preoperative symptoms improved in both of the patients who presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and in both patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no mortality or morbidity, and no new neurological deficits or rebleeding developed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors strongly recommend the multiple burr- hole operation as the surgical treatment of choice for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> because of its safety and effectiveness </plain></SENT>
