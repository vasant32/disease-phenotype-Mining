<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Single case reports suggest that black blood MRI (T1-weighted fat and blood suppressed sequences with and without contrast injection; BB-MRI) may visualize intracranial vessel wall contrast enhancement (CE) in primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (PACNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this single-center observational pilot study we prospectively investigated the value of BB-MRI in the diagnosis of large artery PACNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with suspected large artery PACNS received a standardized diagnostic program including BB-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel wall CE was graded (grade 0-2) by two experienced readers blinded to clinical data and correlated to the final diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four of 12 included patients received a final diagnosis of PACNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them showed moderate (grade 1) to strong (grade 2) vessel wall CE at the sites of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A moderate (grade 1) vessel wall CE grade was also observed in 6 of the remaining 8 patients in whom alternative diagnoses were made: arteriosclerotic disease (n= 4), intracranial dissection (n= 1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (n= 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study demonstrates that vessel wall CE is a frequent finding in PACNS and its mimics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Larger trials will be necessary to evaluate the utility of BB-MRI in the diagnostic workup of PACNS </plain></SENT>
