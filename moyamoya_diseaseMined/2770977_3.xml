<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 30-year-old female was admitted to our institute due to frequent ischemic episodes since she was 25 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of admission, she was asymptomatic with slightly disturbed psychogenic reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of the initial cerebral angiography when she was 25 years old, the right cerebral angiography demonstrated stenosis of the right ICA terminal portion with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the basal area and leptomeningeal anastomosis at the right parietal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left cerebral angiography revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICA system with a lightly narrowing Al portion, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second cerebral angiography, taken 45 months after the initial angiography, demonstrated progression stenosis of the right ICA terminal portion, with decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels at the basal area, obstruction of the left ICA terminal portion, stenosis at the Al portion with newly developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the left basal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We concluded at this time that this case was a definite case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third cerebral angiography after right SDP (synangio-dural plasty), 49 months after the initial angiography, revealed, in the right angiography, newly formed anastomotic vessels perfusing the middle cerebral artery region via the extracerebral arteries and in the left cerebral angiography, and an increased obstruction of the ICA terminal portion, transdural anastomosis via the extracerebral arterial system, and a decrease of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the basal area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This rare case provided us a good picture of the pathogenic mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
