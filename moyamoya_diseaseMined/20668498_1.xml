<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient underwent brain computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and brain angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vessel samples of a. temporalis superficialis were processed by standard histopathological and immunohistochemical methods by analysis of VEGF, VEGFR and nestin expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain angiography revealed both internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> and stenoses of the anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenotic parts of vessels were accompanied by coiled and elongated vessels with a picture of "smoke puffs carried away by breeze" after contrast medium application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination showed: obstruction of lumen, fibrocellular intimal thickening, tortuosity and disruption of internal elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imunohistochemistry confirmed a defect of the internal elastic membrane of the muscular arteria and progressive intimal thickening accompanied by abnormal smooth muscle cells and, VEGF/VEGFR expression in intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nestin positivity in endothelium of arteria indicated that endothelial cells are activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that the endothelium of affected vessels is nestin positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This, together with the finding of VEGF/VEGFR expression, might suggest an active angiogenetic process We present a new conception of pathogenesis but further studies with higher number of patients are necessary to elucidate the role of these growth factors in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
