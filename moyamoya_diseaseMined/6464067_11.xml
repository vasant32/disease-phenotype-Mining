<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown and pathobiology is poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the intracranial arteries in 3 patients to demonstrate characteristic changes and to obtain a better understanding of the basis mechanisms of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls were obtained from 3 normotensive patients who died as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Occluded internal carotid arteries were characterized by severe thickening of the intima with a dense <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> array of smooth muscle cells, a deeper less cellular zone, pronounced tortuosity of the internal elastica and thinning of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collateral vessels were arterial in structure and were affected by similar proliferative changes in the intima, thinning of the media, and contorted internal elastica </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stainable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were not part of the typical components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe contortion of the internal elastica, medial damage and intimal proliferation may result from recurrent and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distal lenticulostriate arteries showed severe medial damage similar to what is termed as a moth-eaten change in hypertensive patients dying of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
