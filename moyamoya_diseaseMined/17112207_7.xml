<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considering three different bypass procedures now in use, (single indirect nonanastomotic bypass procedure, multiple combined indirect (MCI) nonanastomotic procedure and direct anastomosis), the authors attempted to identify the most appropriate bypass procedure for treating ischemic-type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors performed three procedures (the original encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis [EDAS] alone, the frontotemporoparietal combined indirect bypass procedure, and the superficial temporal artery--middle cerebral artery [STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>] anastomosis with encephalomyosynangiosis [EMS]) on 72 hemispheres in 50 patients with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses were then performed to compare postoperative collateral vessel formation found on angiograms, complications, and clinical improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative collateral formations were observed in more than two-thirds of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution after the EDAS alone, the MCI procedure, and the direct anastomosis in 44%, 52%, and 74% of the surgically treated hemispheres, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, frontal encephalomyoarteriosynangiosis of the MCI bypass procedure formed collateral vessels of the anterior cerebral artery distribution in 94% of the treated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, clinical symptoms resolved in 56%, 63%, and 74% of the treated sides 1 year after EDAS alone, MCI procedure, and the direct anastomosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient suffered a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after EDAS alone, two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematomas</z:hpo> after the MCI procedure, and one patient suffered a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one patient a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after undergoing direct anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The direct anastomosis procedure was found to result in the best postoperative collateral vessel formation and clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the single and multiple combined indirect nonanastomotic bypass procedures were found to be safer than direct anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the frontotemporoparietal combined indirect bypass procedure caused the formation of collateral circulation not only in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> but also in the ACA distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on analysis of these findings, the authors recommend the MCI procedure as the appropriate surgical procedure in the treatment of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, although the best treatment is the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with EMS when feasible </plain></SENT>
