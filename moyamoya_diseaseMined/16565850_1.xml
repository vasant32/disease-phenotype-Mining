<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We reviewed a consecutive series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) in children and studied their familial pedigrees to determine whether they showed specific clinical features or patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, and to investigate any correlation between familial MMD and common Asian diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases of familial MMD (N=10) were reviewed in the aspect of clinical presentation, such as, symptoms and signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, imaging studies including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebral angiography, and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT), and operative results including complications, to identify differences between these patients and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> MMD (N=194) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio in those with familial MMD was 4:6 and mean age was 8 years (3-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were ischemic cases and five showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a preliminary genetic study, familial pedigrees were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, their familial histories concerning common Asian diseases, such as, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, were investigated by telephone survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The familial MMD cases did not reveal any differences from the other MMD children in terms of clinical findings, imaging data, or surgical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our series, five cases (50%) showed MMD between siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Familial MMD relations were also observed with cousins, a mother, and an aunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No specific pattern of genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> was observed, and no relation was found between the familial occurrence of MMD and common Asian diseases </plain></SENT>
