<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may be confirmed by digital subtraction angiography, recent studies have shown the accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of transcranial Doppler, a noninvasive and cost-effective method, and specific transcranial Doppler parameters reflecting distinct vascular status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND PATIENTS: Consecutive patients (&gt; 15 years of age) diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by a typical clinical history and digital sub traction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The statuses of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries were graded as stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 by magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean flow velocity and pulsatility index were compared between these groups, and the receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to define transcranial Doppler criteria for distinct vascular status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included (37 women; mean age, 34.9 +/- 11.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean flow velocity was higher and pulsatility index was lower in stage 2 (P &lt; .01), while mean flow velocity was lower and pulsatility index was higher in stage 3 than in stage 1 (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cutoff values reflecting stenosis or occlusion with substantial sensitivity and specificity were as follows: mean flow velocity &gt; 85 cm/s or pulsatility index &lt; 0.60 for stage 2, and mean flow velocity &lt; 50 cm/s for stage 3 of middle cerebral artery; mean flow velocity &gt; 80 cm/s or pulsatility index &lt; 0.60 for stage 2 of anterior cerebral artery; and mean flow velocity &gt; 60 cm/s or pulsatility index &lt; 0.60 for stage 2 of posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transcranial Doppler may help to refine magnetic resonance angiography findings and thus help clinicians differentiate severity or stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
