<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 114 undersized posterior communicating arteries (PCoA-s, external diameter less than 1 mm) and 126 larger ones were investigated histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination of hypoplastic PCoA-s revealed five different structural patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of them showed microscopic appearances characteristic of intracranial arteries seen in adults or newborns without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two other types resembled the histologic picture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya Moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The last type was thin-walled and dilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> PCoA-s larger than 1 mm displayed the adult pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PCoA-s with the Moya Moya-like structure and the thin-walled, dilated pattern contained unusually few reticular fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is supposed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya Moya disease</z:e> may be restricted to the PCoA-s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the types of hypoplastic PCoA-s with reticular fiber deficiency are most probably the source of the so-called unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> regardless of the presence of infundibular widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latter statement stems from the observation that the structure of junctional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> does not differ from that of other segments of the artery that exhibit this alteration </plain></SENT>
