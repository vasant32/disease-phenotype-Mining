<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral perfusion was measured with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT before and after IV administration of 10 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, which was performed both before and after vascular reconstruction by superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and encephalomyosynangiosis (first and second operations) and/or omental transplantation to the brain (third operation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up periods ranged between 12 and 24 months (mean +/- SD, 18.5 +/- 3.2 months) after the first operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repetitive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> disappeared completely after serial vascular reconstructions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before the first operation, cerebral perfusion in the territory of the middle cerebral artery on the side of initial operation was 83.9 +/- 4.7% and was significantly lower than that in the contralateral side (88.3 +/- 4.9%, n = 25; P &lt; .0001, paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasodilatory capacity on the side of the first operation was -18.4 +/- 2.5% and that on the contralateral side -14.4 +/- 2.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The former value was significantly lower than the latter value (n = 25; P &lt; .0001, paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the first operation, cerebral perfusion and vasodilatory capacity on the side of initial operation were markedly improved, to 87.8 +/- 4.5% and -14.7 +/- 2.7%, respectively (n = 25; P &lt; .0001, both cases, paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Before the second operation, cerebral perfusion and vasodilatory capacity on the side of the second operation were 76.6 +/- 4.1% and -20.1 +/- 1.9%, respectively, and significantly lower than those before the first operation (n = 25; P &lt; .0001, both cases, paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients subsequently required bifrontal omental transplantation for repetitive paraparetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> after the second operation; they had low cerebral perfusion and vasodilatory capacity bilaterally in the territories of the anterior cerebral arteries (72.4 +/- 2.7% and -18.6 +/- 1.7%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After omental transplantation, both were significantly increased, to 81.9 +/- 3.4% and -11.8 +/- 1.9%, respectively (n = 25; P &lt; .0001, both cases, paired t test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic compromise existed in patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and was a major cause of development of ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regions in which hemodynamic compromise was present could be determined by measuring regional cerebral perfusion and vasodilatory capacity </plain></SENT>
