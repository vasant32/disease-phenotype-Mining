<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An intracranial stump of an occluded vessel is a rare but important <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> mimic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present 2 cases of middle trunk atresia of the trifurcated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, in which the proximal stump of the atretic vessel mimics an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: Both patients were referred to the authors with a presumptive diagnosis of an unruptured asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation that was found in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aneurysmal shape was conical in one case and in the other case, globoid and saccular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of the catheter angiograms allowed us to notice the fine <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> localized at adjacent M2 segments, in addition to the aneurysmal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration revealed an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trifurcation instead of a bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The middle trunk of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was atretic, showing a thin and white cordlike appearance, and its proximal end was a vascular stump instead of a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjacent M2 segments emitted fine perforating vessels in accordance with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> at angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In angiographic examinations, when an aneurysmal lesion is present at the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation in association with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> at adjacent M2 trunks, the proximal stump of an atretic middle trunk of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> instead of a true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be suspected and treated appropriately </plain></SENT>
