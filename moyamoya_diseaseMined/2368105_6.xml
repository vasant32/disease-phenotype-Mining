<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sites examined in the brain (the frontal pole, frontoparietal convexity, and lateral occipital region) were selected by the presence of angiographic abnormalities on the convexity of the hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> examined sites, neither the vascular density (number of blood vessels per unit length of underlying cortical surface) nor the arterial/venous ratio differed significantly between the patients and 14 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed dilatative changes of both arteries and veins; however, attenuation or disruption of the internal elastic lamina and fibrous intimal thickening were more prominent in those patients who had had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the leptomeningeal vessels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are not newly formed but are merely dilated preexisting vessels and that the structural alteration of the vascular walls suggests their adaptability for participation in the collateral circulation at the cerebral surface </plain></SENT>
