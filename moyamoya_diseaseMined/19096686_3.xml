<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, the primary goal of treatment is to improve collateral circulation through <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we obtained and sub-cultured bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from rats without a cell-mediated immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then, we injected the labeled BMSCs directly into adjacent temporal muscle during encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after BMSC transplantation, we examined the survival of the cells and the extent of neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We divided 20 rats into a BMSC transplantation group (n=12) and a control group (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, an EMS operation was performed, and labeled BMSCs (1x106(6)/100 microL) were injected in the temporal muscle for the transplantation group, while an equivalent amount of culture solution was injected for the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three weeks after the transplantation, temporal muscle and brain tissue were collected for histological examination and western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The capillary/muscle ratio in the temporal muscle was increased in the BMSC transplantation group compared to the control group, showing a greater increase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the brain tissue, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The injected BMSCs in the temporal muscle were vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-positive by immunofluorescence staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both temporal muscle and brain tissue, the expression of VEGF by western blot analysis was not much different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During EMS in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> rat model, the injection of BMSCs resulted in accelerated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in the temporal muscle compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
