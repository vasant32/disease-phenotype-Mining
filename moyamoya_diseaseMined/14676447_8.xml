<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although abnormal thrombogenesis, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and autoimmune process might be involved in the etiology, the genetic pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with HLA alleles in the Korean population, we investigated HLA class I and class II alleles in 28 Moyamoya patients and 198 unrelated healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HLA-B35 allele was significantly increased in the patients compared to the controls (32.1% vs. 10.1%, RR=4.2, p&lt;0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of HLA-B35 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age and sex showed that this allele was significantly increased compared to the controls in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> and female group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially, HLA-B35 was the most significantly increased in female of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> group compared to the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that HLA-B35 may be an useful genetic marker for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, and particularly in females of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> group in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
