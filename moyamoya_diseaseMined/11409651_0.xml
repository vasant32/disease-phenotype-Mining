<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging at the renal artery lesion revealed focal narrowing of the renal artery without vascular wall thickening (i.e., coarctation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The coarctation of the renal artery was adequately dilated by stent implantation after suboptimal balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of the present case suggest that IVUS-guided renal angioplasty is an effective therapeutic procedure for correcting coarctation of the renal artery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
