<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) very rarely develop both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical and radiographic features of MMD in patients who presented with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and haemorrhage, compared with MMD patients who presented with one or the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The records of 92 consecutive patients with MMD were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into three groups, according to the type of presentation: ischaemic presentation (Group I); haemorrhagic presentation (Group H); and haemorrhagic-ischaemic presentation (Group H-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient characteristics, areas of infarction, and angiographic findings were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six (82%) of the 92 patients were categorised as Group I, 7 (8%) as Group H, and 9 (10%) as Group H-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up periods for Group H-I was 55 months (IQR, 36-116 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were eight females in Group H-I, in which the median age was 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the nine cases in Group H-I, six presented with cerebral haemorrhage as the precedent event and three had complications during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In Group H-I, the prevalence of posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) lesions was high (42%) and infarctions were most frequently found in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-related areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of steno-occlusive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions may be of pathogenic importance in MMD patients who develop both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of this type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in MMD patients is higher than expected, and further investigation in clinical settings is thus warranted </plain></SENT>
