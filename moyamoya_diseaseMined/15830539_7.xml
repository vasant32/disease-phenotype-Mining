<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is no epidemiological or clinical data concerning this condition because of its rarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate clinical features and outcomes in patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> we conducted a nation-wide questionnaire survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were sent to 88 neurosurgical institutes in 1994 and we received answers from 66 institutions (75% recovery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is based on the guidelines established by the research committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty three asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients were collected (11 male, 22 female) and divided into 2 groups; group 1 defined as patients without any symptoms, and group 2 as patients who did not show any symptoms except <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>80% of group 1 patients were adults, whereas in group 2, children and adults were equally distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up periods were 3 years and 8 months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among conservatively treated 28 patients, 2 patients died from suspected <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (mortality 7%) and 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> resulted in good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among surgically treated 5 patients, 1 patient showed poor outcome due to post-operative infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other 26 patients showed excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Natural course of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> seemed benign, but mortality from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is not negligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A prospective study of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is necessary to clarify its natural course and appropriate management strategy </plain></SENT>
