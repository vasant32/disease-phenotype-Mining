<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EDAS alone was done in the parietal region of 13 sides in 10 patients, and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with EMS in the parietal region was done on 7 sides in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surgical results of these two different procedures were then compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative collateral formation was observed on external carotid angiograms, and the improvement of clinical symptoms was monitored for 1 year after the bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with EMS was found to be superior to EDAS in both the development of collateral circulation (P less than 0.05) and postoperative clinical improvement (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
