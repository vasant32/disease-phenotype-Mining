<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: In selected patients, extracranial-intracranial bypass remains an important treatment for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass utilizes one STA branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have adopted a "double-barrel" technique, where both branches are joined with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recipients in distinct vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: To assess the feasibility of routinely utilizing both branches of the STA for cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: Ten consecutive patients underwent double-barrel bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected if they demonstrated symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> hypoperfusion resistant to medical therapy, or had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>. "Flow-directed" bypass was performed to augment flow to the territories most at risk in each case, based on preoperative and intraoperative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion was routinely obtained to evaluate baseline deficits and post-operative augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were analyzed to assess patient demographics and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: The double barrel bypass was no more difficult technically than the traditional approach, with the second branch harvested through a small satellite incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By isolating temporary occlusion to each territory, there was no additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to each brain region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No intraoperative complications or wound healing issues occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CT perfusion studies <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed improvement, and delayed vascular imaging demonstrated universal graft patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>9/10 patients have been asymptomatic since surgery, while one patient demonstrated symptoms in a separate vascular distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Double barrel STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass is both feasible and potentially advantageous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our series, both bypass branches remained patent, augmenting flow to the territories most at need </plain></SENT>
