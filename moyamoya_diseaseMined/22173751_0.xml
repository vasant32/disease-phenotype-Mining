<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to correlate presurgical neuropsychological assessments with the severity of primary MMD as measured by CBF and CVR and with secondary damage from MMD as estimated by cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and WMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 31 adult patients with MMD was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Xe-CT was used to obtain CBF and CVR, and MRI was reviewed to grade cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and WMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two tests of executive functioning (FAS and TMT-B) were correlated with imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multiple regression analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a significant overall positive relationship between mean CBF and FAS (P = .038) and TMT-B scores (P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant negative relationship was present between the WMD score and the FAS (P = .009) and TMT-B scores (P = .015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Per-region analysis demonstrated that FAS and TMT-B scores were significantly decreased by the presence of a posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P &lt; .0001 and P = .001) or WMD (P = .006 and P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with posterior parieto-occipital WMD or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary disease</z:e> in the anterior regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Impaired executive functioning in adults with MMD is most strongly associated secondary damage in the form of WMD or cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect is most profound with parieto-occipital lobe involvement, likely a reflection of overall disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increasing global WMD burden may be a better indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> than cortical infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher baseline CBF seem to have better cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
