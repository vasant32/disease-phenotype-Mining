<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether postoperative hyperperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> can be predicted using intraoperative laser Doppler flowmetry and/or thermography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was conducted on 27 patients (39 hemispheres) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During surgery, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter and the temperature of the cortical surface was measured with an infrared thermograph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative hyperperfusion was assessed immediately after surgery based on CBF study under sedation (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>) as &gt;100% increase in corrected rCBF compared to preoperative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative hyperperfusion on CBF was observed in two patients (7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was observed between intraoperative rCBF changes and postoperative rCBF increase (Pearson's method: r=0.555, p=0.0003; simple regression: Y=1.22X+3.289, r (2)=0.308, p=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the rCBF changes measured by laser Doppler flowmetry were significantly greater in patients with postoperative hyperperfusion (p=0.0193) and CHS (p=0.0193) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that intraoperative rCBF measurement using laser Doppler flowmetry may predict a risk of post-EC-IC bypass cerebral hyperperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
