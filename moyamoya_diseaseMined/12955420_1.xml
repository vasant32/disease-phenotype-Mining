<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To detect possible mediators of the thickened intima of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we measured serum alpha-1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) levels and characterized the phenotype of patients with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six individuals were examined, including 29 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> from 14 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum alpha1-AT levels were analyzed by electroimmunoassay and genomic phenotype by isoelectric focusing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> alpha1-AT phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average serum alpha1-AT level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients was significantly higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, although both were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that serum alpha1-AT level may be a marker, rather than an etiologic factor, indicating the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
