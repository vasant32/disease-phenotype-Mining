<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of these findings may be syndromic and may have an underlying genetic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case report and review of the literature of neurological, ophthalmological, and neuroradiological findings including ophthalmic examination, MRI and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old girl presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>reduced visual acuity</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">roving eye movements</z:e> since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmological workup revealed bilateral morning glory disc anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI showed duplication of the pituitary stalk and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033377" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">caudal displacement</z:e> of the floor of the third ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA showed narrowing of the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries with focal narrowing of the proximal middle cerebral arteries consistent with early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Review of the literature of pituitary gland duplication and of the combination of morning glory disc anomaly and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya moya disease</z:e> revealed only one previously reported case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the spectrum of this possibly syndromic presentation may be much broader and include various types of anterior midline defects and may have a common underlying genetic cause </plain></SENT>
