<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Correlation of MRI findings with various vascular pathologies has rarely been attempted in patients with lateral medullary infarction (LMI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to correlate the diverse MRI lesions with the vascular lesions seen on conventional cerebral angiography in LMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects included 34 patients with LMI who underwent both MRI and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the risk factors, clinical features, MRI findings, and angiography results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The size of the infarction was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attempted to correlate the MRI findings with the vascular lesions shown in the angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Presumed causes for infarction were atherothrombosis in 19 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> in 8, cardiogenic embolism in 3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in 1, small-vessel disease in 1, and embolism of unknown source in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Isolated posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) disease (n = 8) was usually associated with atherothrombosis and correlated with thin, round, or diagonal band-shaped lesions in the lateral-superficial area of the caudal medulla and/or dorsolateral portion of the rostral-middle medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short-segment distal vertebral artery (VA) disease (n = 9) was usually due to atherothrombosis and correlated with small lateral caudal and/or medium-sized, diagonal band-shaped rostral-middle medullary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 13 patients with long-segment VA disease sparing (n = 8) or involving (n = 5) the proximal part of the VA with concomitant occlusion of the PICA in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This vascular lesion produced either large MRI lesions extending ventrally (n = 5; 4 were associated with VA dissection) or small lesions mimicking those produced by isolated PICA disease (n = 8; 6 were associated with atherothrombosis and 1 patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These large MRI lesions characteristically produced bilateral or contralateral trigeminal sensory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> angiogram (n = 4; 3 patients were presumed to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, one lesion was associated with small-vessel infarction) was associated with small, round lesions that produced minor and fragmentary symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among these subgroups, the size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the patients with long-segment VA disease due to dissection was significantly larger than that of the patients with other vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> MRI lesions (and consequent clinical syndromes) of LMI are correlated with diverse angiographic findings, which in turn are due to different pathogenic mechanisms: etiology, location and size of the involved vessels, speed of the lesion development, and status of collateral channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Generally, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> related to multiple vessel involvement, dissection, and poor collateral circulation are larger than those associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856737" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">single-vessel disease</z:e>, long-standing atherothrombosis/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e>, and good collateralization </plain></SENT>
