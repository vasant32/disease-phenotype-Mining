<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were obtained on a 2.0 T superconducting system and included T1-weighted sagittal and T2-weighted axial images without implementation of flow compensation (FC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> demonstrated on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were narrowing of the cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) (73%), narrowing or occlusion of the supraclinoid ICA (87%) and proximal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) (91%), and multiple collateral vessels in the basal ganglia and/or thalamus (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parenchymal abnormalities included ischemic infarctions (74%), predominantly located in watershed areas, hemorrhagic infarctions (26%), intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (13%), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was a useful diagnostic modality for detecting both vascular and parenchymal abnormalities associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may obviate the need for invasive angiography as far as the diagnosis is wanted at the non-quantitative level </plain></SENT>
