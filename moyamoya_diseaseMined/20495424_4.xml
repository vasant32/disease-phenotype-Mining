<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our 11-year experience with a novel bypass procedure, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and encephalo-duro-myo-arterio-pericranio-synangiosis (EDMAPS), for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> regarding cerebral hemodynamics and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective study included 75 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, including 28 children and 47 adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and EDMAPS on 123 hemispheres of 75 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to conventional STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and indirect bypass for the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory, the medial frontal lobe was revascularized using the frontal pericranial flap through medial frontal craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical results were analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging, cerebral angiography, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall incidences of mortality and morbidity were 0% and 5.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of cerebrovascular events during the follow-up periods was very low: 0% in pediatric patients and 0.4% in adults over approximately 67 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral angiography showed that the pericranial flap functioned well as donor tissue for indirect bypass, especially in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Follow-up single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography studies revealed that cerebral blood flow and its reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> markedly improved in both the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and anterior cerebral artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings strongly suggest that STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and EDMAPS using a frontal pericranial flap is a safe and effective surgical procedure to further improve the long-term prognosis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by improving cerebral hemodynamics in both the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and anterior cerebral artery territories </plain></SENT>
