<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe two cases with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both of them demonstrated the progression of disease stage on follow-up MRA and DSA, although they were still asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intervals between initial diagnosis and disease progression were 10 and 36 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their SPECT or PET study also revealed a deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics in the involved hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and indirect bypass on the involved hemispheres in order to reduce the risk of subsequent occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative courses were uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up radiological examinations showed well-developed surgical collaterals and improved cerebral hemodynamics on the operated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be carefully followed up in order to avoid overlooking latent progression of disease stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization should be considered when disease stage progresses even if the patients are still asymptomatic, although further investigations are needed to establish the indication for surgical revascularization for asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
