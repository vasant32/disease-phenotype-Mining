<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To study the hemodynamic characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with color Doppler (CD) and power Doppler (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The hemodynamic parameters of intracranial and extracranial arteries from 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> confirmed via digital subtraction angiography and 30 healthy controls were studied with conventional and transcranial CD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were detected as scattered color Doppler signal with low velocity and a low resistance index (RI) at the base of the brain in 10 of the 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The RI of the common carotid arteries and the internal carotid arteries of the patients was significantly higher, whereas the peak velocity was lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The posterior carotid arteries were more frequently involved in children (43.8%) than in adults (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial CD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> can be used to demonstrate the stenosis and occlusion of intracranial arteries and the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined with the hemodynamic characteristics of extracranial arteries and the symptoms of the patients, an accurate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> could be made in the majority of cases using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
