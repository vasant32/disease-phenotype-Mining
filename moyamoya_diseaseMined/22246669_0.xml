<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The ability to visualize blood flow in a vessel-selective manner is of importance in a range of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional X-ray methods are invasive and carry risks to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a noninvasive dynamic angiographic MRI-based technique has been proposed using vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling, yielding vessel-selective angiograms of the four main brain-feeding arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, a novel kinetic model for the signal evolution in such acquisitions is derived and applied to healthy volunteers and to a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-Moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model incorporates bolus dispersion, T(1) decay and radio frequency effects and is applicable to other angiographic methods based on continuous or pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The model fits the data well in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and yields parametric maps relating to blood volume, arrival time, and dispersion, changes to which may indicate disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These maps are also used to generate synthesized images of blood inflow without bias from T(1) decay and radio frequency effects, greatly improving collateral vessel visibility in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-Moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative volume flow rates in downstream vessels are also quantified, showing the relative importance of each feeding artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This framework is likely to be of use in assessing collateral blood flow in patient groups </plain></SENT>
