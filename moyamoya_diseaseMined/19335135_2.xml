<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relative contribution of direct and indirect revascularization procedures to the restoration of collateral blood supply in adult and pediatric patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed 39 combined cerebral revascularization procedures (standard extraintracranial bypass [STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass] plus encephalomyosynangiosis [EMS]) in 10 pediatric and 10 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent physical examination and digital subtraction angiography before and 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass and EMS function were graded as Grade I (poor), II (moderate), or III (good) on the basis of the angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In pediatric patients, bypass function was Grade I in 12, Grade II in 8, and Grade III in 0 hemispheres; EMS function was Grade I in 0, Grade II in 12, and Grade III in 8 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the adult patients, bypass function was Grade I in 8, Grade II in 8, and Grade III in 3 hemispheres; EMS function was Grade I in 10 hemispheres, Grade II in 5, and Grade III in 1 hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the pediatric patients disease was classified as improved in 14 hemispheres on the basis of clinical results and stable in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the adults it was classified as improved in 12 hemispheres stable in 7 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined revascularization led to good angiographic and clinical results in both patient populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Especially in pediatric patients, EMS represents a suitable alternative to bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
