<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the clinical, radiologic, and angiographic records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, as a subset of a previously reported, consecutive series of patients who underwent cerebral revascularization surgery with a standardized surgical procedure, pial synangiosis, between January 1, 1985, and June 30, 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 181 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> from the initial series who were treated surgically during the study period, 16 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (10 female patients and 6 male patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 9.3 years (range: 1-29 years); the average age at the time of surgery was 9.8 years (range: 2-29 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> for 10 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> for 6 patients, computed tomographic and/or MRI scans demonstrated bilateral infarctions for 9 patients and unilateral infarctions for 6, with only 1 patient having no imaging evidence of a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No cases presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative angiography showed the presence of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> changes for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, including posterior circulation involvement for 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment included pial synangiosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, although 1 patient underwent a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical complications included symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematomas</z:hpo> requiring evacuation, at 48 days and 54 days postoperatively (2 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (2 cases), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> within 30 days after surgery, at 1 day and 7 days postoperatively (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Late clinical and radiologic follow-up data (average: 67.6 months; range: 6-146 months) demonstrated no worsening in neurologic status for any patient except for 1 patient who developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> disorder with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002901'>hypocalcemia</z:hpo>; she was totally dependent at the 10-year follow-up evaluation, despite no evidence of new infarction since her surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no clinical or radiologic evidence of new infarction for any patient in late follow-up evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography, conducted 1 year after surgery for 11 patients, revealed radiologic evidence of good to excellent cerebral revascularization in 85% of the surgically treated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients were maintained on lifetime aspirin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical, radiologic, and angiographic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> seem comparable to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cerebral revascularization surgery with the pial synangiosis technique seems to confer long-lasting protection against additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> should be considered in the evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
