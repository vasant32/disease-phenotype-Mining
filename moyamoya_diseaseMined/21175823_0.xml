<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to analyse the clinical features of NVG secondary to carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six cases (36 eyes) with hypoperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> associated with NVG were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had their visual acuity assessed and fundus examined by fundus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography, colour Doppler flow imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, digital subtraction angiography and other techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eyes belonging to 30 males and six females were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 24 right eyes and 12 left eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ages of these patients ranged 18 to 78 years and the mean age was 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The visual acuities ranged from light perception to 0.8 (decimal notation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Posterior segment manifestations included mid-peripheral intraretinal haemorrhages and narrowed <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eyes were associated with either an ipsilateral common carotid artery obstruction or a severe bilateral obstruction of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic clinical features are presented during the process of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Degeneration of the ocular fundus was predominantly on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> manifestations included mid-peripheral haemorrhages and dilated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High intraocular pressure and excavation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the optic disc were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the eyes that were examined, neovascularisation was observed in the iris and anterior chamber and various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo> were present </plain></SENT>
