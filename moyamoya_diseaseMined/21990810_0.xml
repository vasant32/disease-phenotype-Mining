<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disease usually characterized by progressive bilateral distal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion and its consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct (ie, extracranial-intracranial bypass) or indirect cerebral revascularization procedures are the most established and effective treatment strategies for MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case history is presented of a patient with MMD with delayed severe intracranial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> following intracranial carotid artery stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old women presented with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, recurrent episodes of transient right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral catheter angiography and perfusion CT scan with azetozaolamide challenge confirmed impaired left hemispheric perfusion due to severe bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> combined with pathological collaterals, consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endovascular stenting of the left supraclinoidal internal cerebral artery was performed uneventfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five hours after treatment the patient presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002167'>speech disorders</z:hpo> and a CT scan revealed intracerebral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to further rapid clinical deterioration, surgical removal of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> and decompression were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient's poor neurological outcome did not improve during the 2-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates a severe intracerebral and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> following intracranial stenting of the internal carotid artery in a young patient with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Potentially this complication could be attributed to high perfusion pressure breakthrough phenomenon, a known complication after cerebral high-flow bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The role of intracranial stenting, despite established revascularization procedures in patients with MMD, therefore remains highly questionable </plain></SENT>
