<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight consecutive pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> underwent BOLD fMRI CVR studies either on a 1.5-T or on a 3-T scanner with breath-holding techniques in six patients and under general anesthesia (GA) in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had undergone CVR study initially without and later with GA, and another had undergone CVR study before and after a revascularization procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The off-line and real-time processing of the data was done, and the results were compared for general quality and adequacy of the study (scale 0-3, 3 being the best) and for the presence or absence of abnormal reactivity and the location, pattern, and extent of abnormal reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 20 CVR series each was studied on real-time functional MRI and off-line analysis (eight patients, ten sessions, two series per session) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight sessions done under GA were rated as quality class 3 (100 %), whereas only 5 of the 12 (41.7 %) studies with breath-holding technique were considered to be of best quality (class 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the off-line processing, the overall sensitivity of the rtCVR technique was 90 % with a specificity of 100 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: rtCVR assessment in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is feasible, and the results are comparable to that of standard off-line analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results from off-line analysis are only available, at the earliest, several hours after the MRI has been completed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rtCVR can overcome this difficulty and may be equally reliable </plain></SENT>
