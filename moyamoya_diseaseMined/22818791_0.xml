<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare the image contrast of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images and to highlight the pitfalls of 3D FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined 94 brain lesions with 2D and 3D FLAIR at 3T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, we optimized the repetition time and echo time of 3D FLAIR with a volunteer study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, we assessed the conspicuity and detection of the various lesions qualitatively, and the contrast ratio between the gray or white matter and lesions was calculated as a quantitative assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also performed a phantom study to investigate the effects of different flow velocities on 2D and 3D FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With regard to the conspicuity and detection of most lesions (multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, ischemic lesions or infarction, <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> trauma), 3D FLAIR was equal or superior to 2D FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For these lesions, the mean contrast ratios were higher on 3D FLAIR than on 2D FLAIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In terms of lesion conspicuity in the patients with hippocampal <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704231" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leptomeningeal metastasis</z:e>, however, 3D FLAIR was equal or inferior to 2D FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ivy sign in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was frequently obscured on 3D FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The phantom study demonstrated that the signal-intensity ratio on 3D FLAIR decreased more rapidly with increasing velocity than that on 2D FLAIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although 3D FLAIR may replace 2D FLAIR images for most patients, radiologists should keep in mind that 3D has some pitfalls </plain></SENT>
