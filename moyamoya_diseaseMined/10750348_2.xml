<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the hemodynamic pattern in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> before and after vascular reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> cerebral blood flow (CBF) study in 10 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in last 3 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 6 of them, study before and after operation was obtained for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative study was obtained in 2 cases and postoperative study was obtained in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were 5 males and 5 females with age ranging from 1 to 12 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied their regional CBF before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (CCBF) using stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angiography study was obtained for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In the routine study, the CBF and CCBF were poor in the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and well correlated to the angiography finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in case of basal ganglion and posterior cerebral artery involvement, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CBF study was more sensitive than the angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the postoperative cases, the CBF could increase to a level beyond the level of CCBF shown on the preoperative study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic study using stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography can provide an objective reference for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> especially in case that surgical management is considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is a better modality for the evaluation of surgical outcome than the conventional contrast angiography study </plain></SENT>
