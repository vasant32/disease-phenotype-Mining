<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors focus on the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by using immunohistochemical analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors examined two specimens in the circle of Willis obtained at autopsy from two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and two additional specimens obtained from control cadavers with atherosclerotic stenosis of the intracranial carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examinations of the sections of the major intracranial arteries were performed using antismooth muscle cells (SMCs), monocytes, growth factor, cell nuclear antigen, and fragmented DNA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) staining was present only in the endothelial cells of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> specimens and was not seen in control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the endothelial cells and SMCs in the media were positive for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> nick-end labeling of fragmented DNA method but not in the SMCs in the intima in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> specimens, which indicates that an apoptotic process is active in only SMCs in the media but not in the intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is suggseted that the presence of bFGF in the media specifically seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> suppresses the apoptotic process of SMCs in the intima </plain></SENT>
