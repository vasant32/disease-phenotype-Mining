<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT was performed 1 and 7 days after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis on 34 sides of 27 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (6 men, 21 women; 22-62 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 5 to 28 months (mean, 17.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients (13 sides, 38.2%) suffered temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> due to hyperperfusion several days after surgery, which was sustained for several days (7.4 days in average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging/angiography showed the STA as a higher intensity signal than the preoperative finding without ischemic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative SPECT revealed focal intense increase in CBF at the sites of anastomosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (32.4%) had transient focal neurologic deficit mimicking ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (5.9%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611713" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> extending to the ipsilateral sylvian cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were relieved by intensive blood pressure control, and no patients had permanent neurologic deficit or delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical revascularization including STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis is a safe and effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, although temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> due to hyperperfusion could occur at a substantial rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine CBF measurement is recommended for accurate diagnosis of postoperative hyperperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> because its treatment is contradictory to that for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
