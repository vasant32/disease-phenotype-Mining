<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cases showed ischaemic symptoms and the other six cases showed haemorrhagic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PET scan was performed during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control data were obtained from eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow and other physiological parameters in cerebral gray matter, white matter and basal ganglia were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> showed decreased rCBF, though not significant, in cerebral gray matter, white matter and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of rCBF was significant in the cerebral cortex of six haemorrhagic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This significant decrease was considered to be due to diaschisis and also brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> caused by the cerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in rCBV in white matter of the both ischaemic and haemorrhagic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The calculated value of CBF/CBV is considered to be an index of perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This value was significantly decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regions, though rOEF was not significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence the cerebral circulation in adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> appears to be characterized by a mild decrease in perfusion pressure and prolonged circulated time </plain></SENT>
