<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) as an aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) is relatively frequent and in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 53-year-old male patient suddenly developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and an altered state of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of admission, he was found drowsy with global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, stiff neck, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and right Babinski's sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A non-contrast brain computed tomography was performed and a small <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the subarachnoid space over the left frontal and parietal cortex was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four-vessel cerebral angiography showed bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid arteries, with multiple tortuous vessels branching from the anterior and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These abnormal vessels were anastomosing with branches from the posterior cerebral and middle meningeal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With this information, a diagnosis of MMD was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A three-dimensional reconstruction from digital angiography ruled out <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, another angiography was performed and remained the same as previous one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical and radiological characteristics of this case are consistent with previous reports, supporting the theory that non-aneurysmal SAH in MMD is caused by rupture of fragile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
