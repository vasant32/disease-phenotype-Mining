<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> prevents cerebral ischemic attacks by improving cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is undetermined, however, how rapid increase in CBF affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic brain during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study includes nine consecutive cases of patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (2 to approximately 8 years old, 6.2 in average), who underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis on 17 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We prospectively performed single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography 1 and 7 days after 17 surgeries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 37 months (24.9 in average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The outcome of 17 surgeries was excellent (disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) in 14 hemispheres (82.4%) and good (reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>) in three hemispheres (17.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered peri-operative infarction, except for one (5.9%) manifesting as pseudolaminar <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in a part of the cerebral cortex supplied by STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stage, which did not affect his long-term neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient (5.9%) presented with transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo> due to hyperperfusion, which resolved within several days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient manifested permanent neurological deterioration during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis is a safe and effective treatment for childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend routine CBF measurement for avoiding surgical complications including both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
