<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is rare and initially it was believed that the disease was confined to the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It consists of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> at the Circle of Willis with a tendency toward multiple ischemic neurological events and small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In older populations it can often be associated with further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1281300" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular degeneration</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This paper discusses the diagnosis, treatment, and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in a Hispanic child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The case of a Hispanic child who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> over a period of 1 year is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> in the posterior Circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction cerebral angiography showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> at the base of the skull with collateral leptomeningeal and posterior circulation contribution in a pattern typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi> was injected for a SPECT study demonstrating less uptake in the left frontal and left parieto-occipital regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent a left superficial temporal-to-middle cerebral artery anastamosis followed by a right-sided anastamosis in a second operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient tolerated the cerebral revascularization and was symptom-free at 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated improved perfusion in both cerebral hemispheres postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This article reports the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> in a Hispanic child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It illustrates the improved perfusion postoperatively as seen on digital subtraction cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Direct revascularization is felt to be difficult in children and alternatives such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis have been advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Direct revascularization was effective in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in this instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most of the discussion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> has been focused on the Japanese and Far East population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This report confirms the entity as occurring in a Hispanic individual in the United States with no known Japanese ancestry </plain></SENT>
