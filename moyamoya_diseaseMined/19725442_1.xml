<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Structural changes in the extracranial carotid artery are associated with an increase in left ventricular (LV) mass and relative wall thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to determine the relation of LV mass index and relative wall thickness to suspected atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease of the intracranial arteries on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in noncardioembolic ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients who underwent echocardiography and intracranial MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with potential sources of cardioembolism, or known causes of vascular steno-occlusive disease including dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LV mass indexes and relative wall thicknesses were estimated using echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into four groups according to their LV mass index and relative wall thickness: concentric LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, eccentric LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, concentric LV remodelling, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> geometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRA was used to evaluate steno-occlusive disease in the basilar artery (BA) and the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were included, and logistic regression analysis revealed that BA steno-occlusive disease was related to LV relative wall thickness, but not LV mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BA disease was significantly higher in the concentric LV <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> group than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> geometry group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Steno-occlusive disease of the middle cerebral artery was not closely related to the structural changes in the left ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased LV relative wall thickness may be an independent risk factor for BA stenoocclusive disease or may share pathogenic mechanisms with BA disease </plain></SENT>
