<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe three patients with cerebrovascular features of MMD in whom four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the posterior circulation were endovascularly occluded by electrothrombosis using the recently developed Guglielmi electrically detachable coils (GDC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near total occlusion was achieved in three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subtotal occlusion was achieved in one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient developed complications related to the <z:chebi fb="25" ids="35476">neuroleptic</z:chebi> anesthesia administered for the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The particular hazards of anesthesia and aneurysmal surgery in MMD are discussed, and comparison is made with the benefits of using the GDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial experience suggests that this endovascular approach is safe and effective in the treatment of saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, follow-up is necessary to assess long-term persistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration </plain></SENT>
