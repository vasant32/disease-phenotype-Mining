<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether WBH-DTI could detect any difference between ischemic MMD and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, we examined 27 consecutive MMD patients without <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 48 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in this prospective study using a 3.0-T magnetic resonance scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WBHs of fractional anisotropy (FA) (WBH-FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) (WBH-MD) were compared among three groups: Group 1, MMD patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n=15); Group 2, MMD patients without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (n=12); and Group 3, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n=48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group 1 showed significantly higher peak height and significantly lower mean value on WBH-FA, as well as significantly lower peak height and significantly higher mean value on WBH-MD, compared with Groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was seen in parameters at either WBH-FA or WBH-MD between Groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results might reflect the pathological severity of each group, and WBH-DTI could feasibly detect differences between ischemic MMD with infarction and MMD without infarction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
