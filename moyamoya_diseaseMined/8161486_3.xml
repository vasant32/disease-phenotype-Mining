<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective evaluation was performed of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms in 20 pediatric patients with cerebrovascular pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When appropriate, comparisons were made with duplex ultrasonography or conventional catheter angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA accurately assessed the patency of carotid reanastomoses in 8 babies who had previously undergone extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 6 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, MRA accurately evaluated stenotic intracranial carotid and circle of Willis arteries and progressive enlargement of the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries after revascularization procedures, and thus obviated the need for sequential angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Thrombi</z:e> and emboli were identified in 4 of 5 patients with symptoms and imaging evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two-dimensional time-of-flight <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venograms, acquired in both axial and coronal planes, were useful for preoperative venous mapping in a patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002085'>occipital encephalocele</z:hpo> and detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">venoocclusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRA provided diagnostically useful information in a spectrum of pediatric cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can be used as the initial vascular imaging modality for patients with imaging evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular event, to evaluate progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">vasoocclusive disease</z:e>, to evaluate vessel patency following intracranial revascularization surgery, and for visualization of the venous circulation </plain></SENT>
