<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We review six cases of surgically treated ruptured basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, including our own case to illustrate aspects of surgical intervention and the difficulties encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent surgery after 4 weeks of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms showed impressive results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who underwent surgery in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, two died, including our patient, and one showed excellent recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is emphasized that to achieve satisfactory surgical outcome, the following factors should be considered: (i) delayed operation is preferable, with extracranial-intracranial bypass in selected patients; (ii) careful preservation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoyas</z:e> and transdural collaterals is mandatory; (iii) intraoperative rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be avoided; and (iv) using a neuroanaesthetic technique of induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be preferable </plain></SENT>
