<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to define the ACA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> (SP) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and to evaluate temoporal changes according to the disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 139 Moyamoya patients we defined ACASP as narrowing of the ipsilateral A1-2 junction while preserving the anterior communicating artery and supplying the contralateral ACA cortical branches with the development of leptomeningeal collaterals by the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery into the hypoperfused ipsilateral ACA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direction of the steal related to the stage in both hemispheres by Suzuki classification was statistically analyzed using the binomial test based on binomial distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-ups of ACASP were evaluated in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified ACASP in 13 (9%) patients (male:female=7:6, mean age 18 years, range: 2-58 years) of the 139 study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presenting pattern was ischemic in 12 and hemorrhagic in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The direction of SP occurred from the hemisphere in the lower to the higher stage of Suzuki classification (two-tail P value=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After revascularization surgery, ACASP disappeared or diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ACASP may occur in bilaterally different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> as a transient self-adaptive process </plain></SENT>
