<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The c.14576G&gt;A variant in ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) was recently identified as a susceptibility gene variant for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of c.14576G&gt;A variant was evaluated in patients with intracranial major <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>/occlusion (ICASO) without signs of MMD (non-MMD ICASO), as well as in patients with MMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other cerebrovascular diseases</z:e> as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This single-hospital-based case-control study was completed in 7 months (from October 2011-April 2012) at Department of Neurosurgery, The University of Tokyo Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of c.14576G&gt;A variant was analyzed in 41 patients with non-MMD ICASO, in 48 with MMD, in 21 with cervical disease, in 61 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo>, and in 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of 41 patients (21.9%) with non-MMD ICASO and 41 of 48 (85.4%) with MMD had the c.14576G&gt;A variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of 61 patients (1.6%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> and no patients with cervical disease or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects had the variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison of each phenotype group with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects showed that presence of c.14576G&gt;A variant had significant associations with MMD (odds ratio [OR], 292.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.4-5153.0; P&lt;0.0001) and with non-MMD ICASO (OR, 14.9; 95% CI, 0.82-268.4; P=0.01), but no association with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.04-32.0; P=1.00) or cervical disease (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.02-62.3; P=1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that a particular subset of Japanese patients with non-MMD ICASO has a genetic variant associated with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose the existence of a new entity of ICASO caused by the c.14576G&gt;A variant in RNF213 </plain></SENT>
