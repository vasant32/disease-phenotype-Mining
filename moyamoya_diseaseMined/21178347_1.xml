<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical research on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) has focused on symptomatic outcome such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive function in children critically affects social outcome and is closely related to quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to analyze the neurocognitive profiles of children with MMD before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients were selected out of 137 who underwent surgery for MMD between 2006 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive function was tested using the Korean version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (KEDI-WISC-R) and the Bender Gestalt Test (BGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative profiles of patients with or without major infarctions were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with borderzone infarctions were analyzed as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperatively, patients had age-appropriate full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and verbal IQ (VIQ) scores, which were maintained after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was significant improvement in performance IQ (PIQ) (p = 0.01) and BGT scores postoperatively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the subtests, Coding showed significant improvement postoperatively (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, patients with major infarctions had significantly lower FSIQ (p &lt; 0.01), VIQ (p = 0.01) and PIQ (p &lt; 0.01) scores compared with those without infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pre- and postoperative neurocognitive profiles of the patients with borderzone infarctions fell between those of patients with absolutely no infarctions and those of patients with major infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Considering the natural history of MMD, which leads to a drastic decline in neurocognitive functions, the present findings indicate a role for early active surgery to save the intellectual abilities of children with MMD </plain></SENT>
