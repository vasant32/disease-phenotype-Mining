<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a series of 5 patients (mean age, 35; range, 20-50) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were evaluated with <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed clinically significant hypoperfusion in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surgeries were performed by the senior author (ASB) and there were no periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTPs</z:chebi> were performed to assess improvement after the bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> images clearly demonstrated patency of the bypass and restoration of flow, particularly in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (mean, 18 months), 3 patients continued to be asymptomatic, one patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> improved, and another patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> improved but remained aphasic (mean Glasgow Outcome Score, GOS = 4.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> displayed a reduced risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; no <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>, a more convenient and less expensive imaging test than other available options, can provide an assessment of cerebral blood flow after cerebral bypass that appears to correlate with postoperative clinical and angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, in this small series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass appeared to prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
