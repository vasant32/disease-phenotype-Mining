<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on 63 patients hospitalized with MMD between 1999 and 2004 were retrospectively examined to determine the incidence of asymptomatic MBs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gradient-echo T2*-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies obtained using 3- and 1.5-tesla units were available in 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients consisted of five men and 20 women, ranging in age from 17 to 66 years (mean age 41 +/- 14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic MMD was diagnosed in 18 patients, and hemorrhagic MMD in seven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of MBs was also evaluated using the same 3-tesla <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging unit in 34 healthy volunteers including seven men and 27 women, ranging in age from 18 to 71 years (mean age 33 +/- 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the 3-tesla <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit, asymptomatic MBs were demonstrated in 11 patients (44%); they were detected in seven patients (28%) by using the 1.5-tesla unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 3-tesla <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies in healthy individuals, MBs were found in two patients (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on 3-tesla <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies, the incidence of MBs was significantly higher in patients with MMD compared with that in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic MBs were demonstrated in eight (44%) of 18 patients with ischemic MMD and three (43%) of seven patients with hemorrhagic MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microbleeds are significantly more common in patients with MMD than in healthy individuals regardless of the disease type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of MBs with T2*-weighted 3-tesla <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging might contribute to the treatment of MMD </plain></SENT>
