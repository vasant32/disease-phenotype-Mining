<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method utilized has several advantages over conventional studies using isotope, providing high resolution images in a direct relation to CT <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten representative cases were presented from 25 consecutive cases of occlusive disease studied by this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method included inhalation of 40 to 60% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> with serial CT scanning for 25 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>K (build-up rate), lambda (partition coefficient) and CBF values were calculated from HU for each pixel and Xe in expired air, based on Fick's principle, and displayed on CRT as K-, lambda- and CBF-map separately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF for gray matter of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control was 82 +/- 11 ml/100 gm/min and that for white matter was 24 +/- 5 ml/100 gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ischemic threshold for gray matter appeared to be approximately 20 ml/100 gm/min, as blood flow in focus of complete infarction was below this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood flow between 20-30 ml/100 gm/min caused some change on CT, such as localized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, cortical thinning, loss of distinction between gray and white matter and decreased or increased density, which were considered to be compatible with pathological changes of laminar <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a case with occlusion of middle cerebral artery with subsequent recanalization, causing hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, hyperemia was observed in the infarcted cortex that was enhanced by <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periventricular lucency observed in two cases, where blood flow was decreased below threshold, could be classified as "watershed infarction" mainly involving white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, blood flow in the anterior circulation was decreased near ischemic level, whereas that in basal ganglia and territory of posterior cerebral artery was fairly preserved, which was compatible with general angiographic finding of this disease </plain></SENT>
