<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two pediatric patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) in 35 and completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients underwent indirect synangiosis through "small craniotomy," whereas the other 42 underwent superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and indirect synangiosis through "large craniotomy." Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was measured using the Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC) after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models were applied to test the effect of clinical factors on intellectual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Eight patients revealed mentally impaired status (FSIQ&lt;70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and "small craniotomy" surgery were significantly associated with poor intellectual outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios of each factor were 33.4 (95% CI, 2.4-474) and 19.6 (95% CI, 1.8-215) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and the revascularization procedure over as wide an area as possible may be essential to improve their intellectual outcome </plain></SENT>
