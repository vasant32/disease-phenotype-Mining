<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution pattern of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated in 13 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Combined surgery involving encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis and encephalomyosynangiosis was performed in 21 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was assessed by dynamic imaging using N-isopropylp[123I]iodoamphetamine-single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT) at 46 months on average after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of the patients suffered recurrent ischemic attacks after the bilateral combined surgery, and 62% showed excellent active daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 70% showed poor school performance with impaired cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the superficial temporal artery was dilated in follow-up angiograms, the revascularized area was confined to the craniotomy field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF images disclosed a low-perfusion state with a noninfarcted ischemic pattern in 71% of the revascularized hemispheres, especially in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings show that although potentially beneficial effects can be expected following revascularization, it should be recognized that, in most patients, increased blood flow is gained only in a limited area around the surgical field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients who show progressive reduction of regional CBF, additional revascularization procedures are recommended </plain></SENT>
