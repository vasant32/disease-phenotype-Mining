<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative longitudinal IQ data were obtained from 15 children (seven males, eight females) who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi>) following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (six with SCA, nine without SCA), and 19 controls (10 males, nine females; nine healthy control participants, 10 with SCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At baseline assessment (Time 1) median age of patients was 7 years 6 months (range 3y 7mo to 12y 5mo); median age of controls was 6 years 3 months (range 4y to 11y 6mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At follow-up (Time 2), ages were 11 years 8 months (range 3y 7mo to 12y 5mo) and 12 years 8 months (range 6y 4mo to 16y 8mo) in patients and controls respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median duration of follow-up for the patient group was 3 years (range 7 to 10y) and in controls, 4 years 1 month (range 1 to 10y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In children with SCA, Verbal and Performance IQs (VIQ and PIQ) were significantly lower than in controls at Time 1; there was an additional independent statistically significant reduction in PIQ associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there were further significant reductions in IQ by the second assessment for patients with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> compared with controls, IQ did not differ significantly between groups with and without SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While the reduction in IQ attributed to SCA does not appear to become more marked with increasing age, the difference between those with and without <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> is associated with increasing effect over time </plain></SENT>
