<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors analyzed the epidemiological data of Korean patients taken from the National Health Insurance Corporation in Korea among <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients who were treated from 2004 until 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on 2004 data, 2,539 MMD patients were treated in Korea and the prevalence rate was 5.2 per 100,000 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 2,987 in 2005, 3,429 in 2006, 4,051 in 2007, and 4,517 cases in 2008, and the prevalence rates per 100.000 people were 6.3, 7.0, 8.6, and 9.1, for those respective years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This represents an annual increase of 15% of new cases during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2008, 466 people were newly diagnosed with MMD, representing an incidence rate of 1 per 100,000 persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gender ratio was 1,547 men (34%) and 2,970 women (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women had a higher incidence rate than men (1.94 times) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two age peaks: teenagers and those in their forties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study shows that the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients in Korea is increasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This increase could partly be explained by a recent increase in newly diagnosed cases, suggesting that a more careful consideration of the disease and better diagnostic techniques should be promoted among clinicians </plain></SENT>
