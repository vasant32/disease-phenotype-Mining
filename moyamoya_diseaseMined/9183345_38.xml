<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We reviewed surgically treated patients with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and examined whether vasoreconstructive surgeries reduced the risk of recurrent ischemic attacks and changed overall outcomes in terms of the patients' performance and intellectual status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-four hemispheric sides in 34 pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients who received surgical treatment were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass and encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) on 48 sides (combined group) and indirect bypass surgery such as EDAMS on 16 sides (indirect group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 34 patients were observed postoperatively from 1 to 14 years (mean +/- SD, 6.6 +/- 3.8 years) and were examined for the incidence of recurrent ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 patients, 23 were followed up for &gt; 5 postoperative years, and their overall outcomes in terms of their performance and intellectual status were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative ischemic events (&lt; or = 2 weeks after surgery) occurred in 5 surgeries (31%) of the indirect group and in 6 (13%) of the combined group (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative ischemic events (&gt; 2 weeks after surgery) was significantly reduced in the combined group (10%) compared with the indirect group (56%; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 patients observed &gt; 5 years, 7 patients (30%) were mentally retarded and regarded as having a fair outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combined surgery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass with EDAMS) for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was effective in reducing the risk of postoperative ischemic attacks compared with indirect surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization may be effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>intellectual deterioration</z:hpo> and improving overall outcome </plain></SENT>
