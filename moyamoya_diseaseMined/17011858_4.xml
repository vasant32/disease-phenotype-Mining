<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: An association between morning glory disk anomaly (MGDA) and intracranial vascular anomalies including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> has been recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a series of patients with MGDA to ascertain the frequency of cerebrovascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the neurologic histories and neuroimaging studies of twenty patients with MGDA at two institutions between 1982 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had not undergone neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI/MRA studies done for 40 pediatric patients without MGDA were also evaluated for cerebrovascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of anomalies in the two groups was compared by Fisher exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of 20 patients (45%) with MGDA had cerebrovascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anomalies ranged from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of the A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery to bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid arteries with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten of 40 patients (25%) in the control group had any intracranial vascular anomaly, whereas only two of 40 (5%) had an abnormality of the anterior circulation, the most common finding in the MGDA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We recommend that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with MGDA undergo MRI/MRA or computerized tomographic angiography to detect vascular and structural brain anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may be unclear whether cerebrovascular anomalies represent isolated congenital anomalies or findings of progressive occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up imaging should be considered in patients with cerebrovascular anomalies and is clearly indicated if neurologic signs or symptoms are present </plain></SENT>
