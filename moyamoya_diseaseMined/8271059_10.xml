<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who were classified in three grades according to their angiographic stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Techniques used included ring-type emission computed tomography with a minicomputer system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received 111 MBq of 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> and SPECT images were obtained 20 min postinjection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were studied using iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) SPECT with and without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was performed 20 min after each injection of 1 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Low perfusion areas in the upper and lower frontal, parietal and temporal regions in grades 2 and 3 using <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean cerebral-to-cerebellar activity ratios (C/C ratio) of six regions (upper and lower frontal, temporal, parietal occipital and basal ganglia) in grades 1, 2 and 3 were 0.96 to 1.06, 0.91 to 0.96 and 0.76 to 0.88, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) elucidates cerebral hemodynamic factors, including the reactivity of cerebral vessels which cannot be detected angiographically in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> test is useful for detecting cerebral blood flow reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The test can be used to detect disease progress prospectively </plain></SENT>
