<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> at a tertiary center between January 2000 and December 2006 were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentations, underlying diseases, prothrombotic risk factors, family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, radiological findings, treatment, and outcome of the patients were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients with angiographically proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were identified, one of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type I and one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The age at diagnosis varied between 19 months and 11 years (73.4±41.8 months, mean±SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period after diagnosis was 52.5±14.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six patients, the initial clinical presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients had any identifiable prothrombotic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite medical and surgical treatment, three patients had recurrences and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two patients recovered without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The value of prothrombotic risk factor evaluation appears to be limited in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients; the outcome for pediatric patients remains dismal </plain></SENT>
