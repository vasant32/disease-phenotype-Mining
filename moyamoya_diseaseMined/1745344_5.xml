<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three women had been on OCs for at least 4 years, one woman each had been on OCs for 3 months and for 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five women had smoked cigarettes for at least eight pack-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intermittent and progressive multifocal cognitive, visual, motor, or sensory hemispheric symptoms and signs developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, four preceded by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in four patients and proximal posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional features included rete mirabile, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasias</z:hpo>, prominent lenticulostriate collaterals, and multifocal distal cerebral branch occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three had mild abnormalities of serum fibrinogen, antinuclear antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or CSF IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After discontinuing OCs and reducing cigarette use, four women have not had further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> over a mean follow-up of approximately 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In certain young women, clinical and angiographic features resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> may develop with the use of OCs and cigarettes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We speculate that an immunologically mediated vasculopathy may explain, in part, this unusual cerebrovascular syndrome in otherwise healthy young women </plain></SENT>
