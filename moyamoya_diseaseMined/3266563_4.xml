<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Steady-state methods with C15O2 and 15O2 were used to obtain the functional images of rCBF, rCMRO2, and rOEF </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischemic neurological deficit</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e>), and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interval between the latest ictus and PET scan ranged from 3 days to 3 years 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters (rCBF, rCMRO2 etc.) in cerebral gray matter, cerebral white matter and basal ganglia were calculated from the single functional images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Any, low density areas appearing in X-ray-CT performed just prior to the PET study were carefully excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The parameters of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were statistically compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Though the value of rCBF was slightly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ratio of CBF to CBV is considered to be the index of perfusion pressure and reciprocal of cerebral mean transit time under the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> autoregulation of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This ratio was calculated and compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value for each tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
