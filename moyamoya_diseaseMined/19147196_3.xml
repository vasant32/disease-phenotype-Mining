<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusive cerebrovascular disease with unknown etiology characterized by an abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain, which can manifest both as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was also reported that the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are more vulnerable to cerebral hyperperfusion such as postoperative hemorrhagic complication after extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery despite its low flow revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying mechanisms of its <z:mp ids='MP_0003711'>pathologic angiogenesis</z:mp> and the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excessive degradation of the vascular matrix by MMPs, proteolytic enzymes that degrade <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the components of extracellular matrix, can lead to instability of the vascular structure and can thereby cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MMPs also play an important role in tissue remodeling including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in both physiologic and pathologic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 16 cases with definitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared them with those from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum MMP-9 level was significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (40.18 ng/mL) than in healthy controls (13.75 ng/mL, P = .0372) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in serum MMP-2 level between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (646.65 ng/mL) and healthy control (677.60 ng/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry on the surgical specimens showed significant increase in MMP-9 expression within the arachnoid membrane of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased expression of MMP-9 may contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0003711'>pathologic angiogenesis</z:mp> and/or to the instability of the vascular structure and could thereby cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
