<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiographic findings were reviewed for stenoocclusive lesions, form of the main cerebral arteries, transdural anastomoses, and basal vascular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 27 patients with bilaterally symmetrical or asymmetrical lesions and four with unilateral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two of these latter four patients, follow-up studies showed progression of the disease to the opposite side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 58 sides investigated, stenoocclusive lesions were localized above the origin of the anterior choroidal artery in 33 internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries were noted more frequently than stenoses: 89 vs. 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the nests of abnormally dilated vessels (73 of 102) were localized in the ethmoidal region and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analysis of distribution of the transdural collateral pathways to the brain discovered predominant participation of the middle meningeal and occipital arteries (43 of 55) </plain></SENT>
