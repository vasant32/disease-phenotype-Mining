<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify whether any mutations of candidate genes including SHH, ZIC2, SIX3, and TGIF exist in a Taiwanese family segregated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001360'>holoprosencephaly</z:hpo> (HPE) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genotypes of the candidate genes SHH, ZIC2, SIX3, and TGIF were determined in the family members who were available for analysis by sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, genomic regions of another 50 unrelated Taiwanese (100 chromosomes) were studied to verify whether the nucleotide changes we found were mutations or polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel missense mutation 377T &gt; C and two polymorphisms (420A &gt; G and 487C &gt; T) in the TGIF gene were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No mutations in SHH, ZIC2 and SIX3 were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mother of the three HPE fetuses was found to be afflicted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A brief review of the mutations as well as polymorphisms reported in the TGIF gene up to 2005 is given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Molecular diagnosis can help genetic counseling in HPE, which is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder with its phenotypic and genotypic spectrum highly widened and variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible association between TGIF mutation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> noted in our study also appeared to be novel </plain></SENT>
