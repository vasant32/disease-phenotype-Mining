<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We previously reported that the level of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is high in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the levels of other angiogenic growth factors in the CSF of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients and the clinical significance of bFGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The levels of bFGF, interleukin-8, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, endothelial growth factor, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor in CSF, taken from 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and 16 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> (control group), were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the correlation between the level of bFGF and the clinical factors of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> pattern, development of neovascularization, and cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CSF of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients contained a high concentration of bFGF to a significant (P &lt; .05) extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bFGF level was apparently elevated in the patients in whom neovascularization from indirect revascularization, such as encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, was well developed (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A linear correlation between the values of bFGF and cerebral vascular response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (r = .7; P &lt; .05) was revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other angiogenic factors were not significantly high compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The elevation of bFGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> seems to be specific and is not related simply to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the bFGF level is a useful indicator to predict the efficacy of indirect revascularization after surgery </plain></SENT>
