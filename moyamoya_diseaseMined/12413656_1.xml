<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Auditory-evoked magnetic fields of ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 8 patients with right hemispheric infarction, 11 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dizziness, and 2 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze the abnormality of auditory neural networks, the magnitude ratio and the angle difference (Deltatheta) between response vectors, which were determined from maximum current arrows corresponding to the N100m peak for contralateral and ipsilateral stimuli were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of the parameters was defined so that abnormal values could be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the three parameters, Deltatheta was the most sensitive: 4 patients with right hemispheric infarction, 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dizziness, and 1 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> had abnormal Deltatheta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electrical activity in the patients with such abnormal Deltathetas had a circular current pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that right infarction lesions sometime affect the left auditory neural network, dizziness is caused by abnormal neural networks between the vestibular cortical area and the auditory cortex or by an imbalance between left and right auditory-cortex activities, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya-disease</z:e> patients have almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> auditory-electrical activity </plain></SENT>
