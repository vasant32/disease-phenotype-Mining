<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are: (1) stenosis or occlusion of the anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries, (2) an abnormal vascular network near these arteries and (3) bilateral findings </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is high in the Mongol race, although the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> is more frequently reported among Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the last two decades 41 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> were diagnosed in two Hungarian and two Scandinavian hospitals, respectively </plain></SENT>
