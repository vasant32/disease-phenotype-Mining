<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 155 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, which included 24 familial cases (10 family pedigrees) and 131 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features were compared between the familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A female preponderance was significantly more prominent in the familial than in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> group (P=0.0421) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was significantly lower in familial than in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eight parent-offspring pairs, mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was significantly lower in the second than in the first generation (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003743'>genetic anticipation</z:hpo> and female predominance and that a genetic analysis study focused on expanded triplet repeats may clarify the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
