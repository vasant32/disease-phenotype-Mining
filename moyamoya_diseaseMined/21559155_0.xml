<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To re-emphasize that indirect revascularization surgery alone, where multiple burr holes and arachnoid openings are made over both cerebral hemispheres, is beneficial in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report a 10-year-old boy who presented with complaints of episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> for the last 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the peak of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> he had visual disturbances and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of left-sided limbs, recovering within a few minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had no focal neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radiological investigations revealed abnormal findings, demonstrating the features of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SURGICAL MANAGEMENT: He underwent bilateral multiple burr holes, dural and arachnoid opening over the frontal, parietal and temporal regions of each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elevated periosteal flap was placed in contact with the exposed brain through each burr hole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On 6-months follow-up he had only one episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative four vessel angiogram demonstrated excellent cerebral revascularization around the burr hole sites, and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography imaging showed hypoperfusion in the right temporo-occipital area suggestive of an old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with no other perfusion defect in the rest of the brain parenchyma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In children with MMD this relatively simple surgical technique is effective and safe, and can be used as the only treatment without supplementary revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This procedure can be done in a single stage on both sides and the number of burr holes made over each hemisphere depends on the extent of the disease </plain></SENT>
