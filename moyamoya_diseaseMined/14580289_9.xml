<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report on two Japanese women who experienced the concurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> attributable to multiple intracranial arterial stenoses around the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, these patients demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000853'>goiter</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ophthalmopathy</z:e>, and ensuing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated multiple intracranial arterial stenoses around the circle of Willis in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases did not meet the full diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, in that there were no abnormal, net-like, collateral vessels, but the other clinical and angiographic findings were consistent with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After normalization of their hormonal conditions, the patients underwent cerebral revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients achieved excellent recoveries and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> daily life after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple intracranial arterial stenoses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> may occur simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such cases may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of these two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is important to study more patients with this dual condition, to obtain more evidence of the relationship between genetic and immunogenic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
