<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aldolase C (AldC) is the brain specific isoform of the glycolytic enzyme <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to its characteristic striped expression pattern in the adult cerebellum AldC is also termed zebrin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate release of AldC into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies with cell cultures confirmed that AldC is released to the extracellular space after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, addition of purified recombinant AldC to networks of cortical neurons plated on multielectrode arrays reversibly inhibited the spontaneous generation of action potentials at AldC concentrations which can be expected to occur after lesions of the human cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mechanism could be relevant in the pathogenesis of the electrophysiological changes in the penumbra region after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
