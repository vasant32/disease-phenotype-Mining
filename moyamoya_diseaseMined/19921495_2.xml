<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In an earlier study, we identified a locus for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) on 17q25.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Linkage analysis and fine mapping were conducted for two new families in additional to the previously studied 15 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three genes, CARD14, Raptor, and AATK, were selected based on key words, namely, "<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>", "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>", "proliferation", and "vascular system", for further sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A segregation analysis of 34 pedigrees was performed, followed by a case-control study in Japanese (90 cases vs. 384 controls), Korean (41 cases vs. 223 controls), Chinese (23 cases and 100 controls), and Caucasian (25 cases and 164 controls) populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Linkage analysis increased the LOD score from 8.07 to 9.67 on 17q25.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fine mapping narrowed the linkage signal to a 2.1-Mb region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing revealed that only one newly identified polymorphism, ss161110142, which was located at position -1480 from the transcription site of the Raptor gene, was common to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four unrelated sequenced familial affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ss161110142 was then shown to segregate in the 34 pedigrees studied, resulting in a two-point LOD score of 14.2 (P = 3.89 × 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its penetrance was estimated to be 74.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the Asian populations tested (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese), the rare allele was much more frequent in cases (26, 33, and 4%, respectively) than in controls (1, 1, and 0%, respectively) and was associated with an increased odds ratio of 52.2 (95% confidence interval 27.2-100.2) (P = 2.5 × 10(-49)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This allele was, however, not detected in the Caucasian samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Its population attributable risk was estimated to be 49% in the Japanese population, 66% in the Korean population, and 9% in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ss161110142 may confer susceptibility to MMD among East Asian populations </plain></SENT>
