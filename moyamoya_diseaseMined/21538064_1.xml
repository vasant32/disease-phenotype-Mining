<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since most literatures have focused on the rCBF changes of operative hemisphere, we evaluated the hemodynamics of nonoperative side by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced computed tomography (Xe-CT) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test in patients with MMD during a short time follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen MMD patients with unilateral ischemic presentations who received direct revascularization on the symptomatic hemispheres with complete hemodynamic evaluations by Xe-CT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic evaluations were performed 1, 3, and 6 months, postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative rCBF and cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) were recorded and correlated with clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed if the patient had neurological deterioration or deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up time was 8.5±3.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three months after the ipsilateral direct revascularization, the CVR of nonoperative hemispheres (25.8±8.1%) began to decrease significantly (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months later, the rCBF showed a downward trend in nonoperative hemispheres (47.4±8.0 ml·100 g(-1) min(-1)) than the preoperative status, but the difference was not significant (P=0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with decreased rCBF and impaired CVR in the nonoperative hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among them, two patients were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Unilateral direct revascularization in symptomatic hemisphere for MMD patient could induce CVR impaired in primary asymptomatic hemisphere during the short term after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, critical follow-up, especially the hemodynamic follow-up in the asymptomatic hemispheres should be performed in patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
