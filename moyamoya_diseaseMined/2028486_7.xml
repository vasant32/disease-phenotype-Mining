<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurring in infants and children, we evaluated 54 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, excluding cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, in patients less than 16 years old at 24 clinics in the Tohoku (northeast) district of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed two incidence peaks, one in little children and the other in junior high school students </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> and minor head trauma were more frequently seen prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> than was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The middle cerebral artery region, including the basal ganglia, was most commonly affected (49 patients, 91%) on computed tomograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed in 48 patients (89%) and showed various types of occlusive lesions, mostly affecting the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>Hemiparesis</z:hpo> was the most common form of disability following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (48 patients, 89%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was carried out in seven patients (13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of these cases showed that the recovery of children after a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> tends to be better than that of adults, but that permanent disabilities, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, occur commonly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of juvenile cerebrovascular disease is important to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
