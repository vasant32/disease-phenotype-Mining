<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 97 consecutive patients with haemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> from 1997 to 2009 were enrolled in this study (mean age 31Â±10 years; range 5-56 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical charts and radiographs of patients at the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was obtained prospectively by questionnaires and radiographic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were compared based on initial treatment (conservative vs surgical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 7.1 years, 21 of the 97 (21.7%) patients developed a second episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and six patients (6.2%) died of intracranial rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median interval from initial episode to subsequent rebleeding was 9.1 years (0.1-23.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>17 of 43 (37.1%) conservatively treated patients and four of 54 (7.4%) surgically treated patients experienced a rebleeding event (OR 8.1; 95% CI 2.4 to 26.8; p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a difference in the Kaplan-Meier curve of rebleeding between the two groups (Breslow test p=0.047; log rank test p=0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rebleeding ratio in patients who underwent direct bypass was lower than that in patients treated with indirect bypass alone (0% vs 28.5%, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.9; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was found between rebleeding and the patient's age, sex, location of haemorrhage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> status or presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There is a high risk of rebleeding after the first haemorrhagic episode in Chinese patients with haemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Revascularisation surgery can improve regional blood flow and have greater efficacy at preventing rebleeding than conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
