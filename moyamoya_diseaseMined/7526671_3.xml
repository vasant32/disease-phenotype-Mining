<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with early cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were studied with proton density- and T2-weighted images, and T1-weighted images at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement was added in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases there was high to intermediate intensity in the cortex and low intensity in the subcortical white matter (subcortex) on the proton density- and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant signal abnormalities were shown on T1-weighted images in the subcortex; gyriform enhancement was seen in the affected cortex in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the six patients studied with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the four patients with follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRs</z:e>, the subcortical low intensity changed to high intensity in two and remained low in two patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> nor calcification was seen on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Iron accumulation in the subcortex caused by disruption of the axonal transportation and continuous production of free radicals caused by the hypoxic-ischemic state most likely reduces the signal intensity of the subcortex on the proton density- and T2-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subcortical low intensity on the proton density- and T2-weighted images is an important diagnostic sign of early cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
