<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MMD is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, specifically in the younger population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is based on only radiological features as no other clinical data are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to identify novel biomarker candidate proteins differentially expressed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MMD using proteomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For detection of biomarkers, CSF samples were obtained from 20 patients with MMD and 12 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mass spectral data were generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) with an <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> exchange chip in three different buffer conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After expression difference mapping was undertaken using the obtained protein profiles, a comparative analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A statistically significant number of proteins (34) were recognized as single biomarker candidate proteins which were differentially detected in the CSF of patients with MMD, compared to the control patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> peak intensity profiles of the biomarker candidates underwent classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to produce prediction models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two important biomarkers could successfully classify the patients with MMD and control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, several novel biomarker candidate proteins differentially expressed in the CSF of patients with MMD were identified by a recently developed proteomic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is a pilot study of CSF proteomics for MMD using SELDI technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These biomarker candidates have the potential to shed light on the underlying pathogenesis of MMD </plain></SENT>
