<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the disease has not yet been clearly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the noninvasive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in a patients with a very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms in infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made by colour coded Doppler sonography and confirmed by angiography at the age of 6 months, following two episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A bilateral encephalodurosynangiosis was performed at the age of 7 months with subsequent slight improvement of the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colour Doppler sonography revealed early vascularisation from the fascia temporalis graft into the arachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the age of 10 months the patient developed arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> caused by left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our case suggests, that in infancy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> can be suspected noninvasively by colour Doppler sonography of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients should be carefully screened for possible extracranial arterial stenoses which may develop in the course of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Encephalodurosynangiosis seems to be a good therapeutic option for patients with severe neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
