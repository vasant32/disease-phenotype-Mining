<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) is still widely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several publications on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> describe differences of cytokine and growth factor concentrations in different specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the DNA of patients with MMD for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and upstream of the genes for previously described associated cytokines and growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirteen SNPs were genotyped in or upstream to four genes-basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), cellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi>-binding protein 1 (CRABP1), platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1)-comparing 40 DNA samples of MMD patients to 68 healthy controls from central Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by sequencing the SNP-containing genetic regions with custom made primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: We found association of two SNPs: rs382861 [A/C] (p = 0.0373, OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.03-3.17) in the promoter region of PDGFRB and rs1800471[C/G] (p = 0.0345, OR = 7.65, 95% CI = 0.97-59.95), located in the first exon of TGFB1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate possible genetic risk factors for the genesis of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TGFB1 and PDGFRB are involved in vascular growth and transformation processes which may play a role in the development of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further analyses in larger European cohorts and replication in patients of different ethnicity, as well as functional studies, may lead to possible early detection of patients at risk for developing MMD and subsequently to future preventive therapies </plain></SENT>
