<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The parietal synangiosis group consisted of 10 sides in five patients, and the frontal anastomosis group consisted of 30 sides in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The development of postoperative collateral circulation was assessed by external carotid angiography, the neurological outcome was monitored for 2 years after surgery, and the intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured at least 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Frontal anastomosis achieved superior results compared to the parietal synangiosis assessed by development of collateral circulation, in particular to the orbitofrontal artery, the prefrontal artery, and the precentral artery (p &lt; 0.01), and reduction in the incidence of ischemic attacks, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean IQ in the frontal anastomosis group was higher than that in the parietal synangiosis group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular reconstruction centered on the frontal region utilizing both the anterior and posterior branches of the STA is more efficacious than only synangiosis centered on the parietal region </plain></SENT>
