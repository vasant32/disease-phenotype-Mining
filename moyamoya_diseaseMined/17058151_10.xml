<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, so long as the ROIs were manually selected, results obtained fluctuated considerably with subtle changes in their positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To perform an ROI analysis of the brain with improved objectivity and excellent reproducibility, we recently established fully automated ROI-based analysis software for the brain, the so-called 3DSRT and the FineSRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3DSRT performed by consecutive analyzing process as follows: (1) anatomical standardization using the SPM99 algorithm; (2) analysis using constant 318 ROIs divided into 12 groups (segments) on each hemisphere; (3) calculation of the area-weighted average for each of the respective 24 segments; (4) display of the results followed by the saving of respective values of the 636 ROIs (both hemispheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The processes of the FineSRT were fundamentally similar to that of 3DSRT, but on FineSRT more precise constant 1394 ROIs (both hemispheres) corresponding to the respective cerebral convolutions were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our programs have been useful for objective estimation of cerebrovascular reserve, especially for follow-up studies of an infant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, because we could compare the results without consideration of the patient's growth during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
