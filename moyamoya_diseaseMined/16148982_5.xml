<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It most commonly presents in children, but is also frequently seen in adults, especially in the third or fourth decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adults afflicted with this disease have very different clinical characteristics as compared with children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, adults more commonly present with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, while children present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> nearly 75% of the time and very rarely present with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This significantly impacts treatment considerations for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patient, as cerebral revascularization, though well accepted in the context of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, is relatively controversial for the prevention of rehemorrhage </plain></SENT>
