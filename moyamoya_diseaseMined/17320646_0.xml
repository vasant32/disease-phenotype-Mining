<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report a case of an adult with MMD who presented initially with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> that had suddenly progressed to bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100704'>cortical blindness</z:hpo> 1 year and 9 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old male presented with visual blurring and mild right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> that developed suddenly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was regarded as having MMD based on an imaging study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An inverted encephalodurogaleosynangiosis using the left occipital artery and inverted encephaloduroarteriogaleosynangiosis with the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery were done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful and without any complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several months later, he visited again because of sudden bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> preceded by repeated transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> in both eyes for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The right posterior temporal artery, which was well visualized at the time of the first postoperative follow-up angiography, was no longer seen on repeated 4-vessel angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Biochemical analysis including prothrombin and thrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, d-dimer, plasminogen, antithrombin, platelet, protein C and S, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28494">cardiolipin</z:chebi> antibodies; VDRL was within the reference range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors suggest abnormal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> as a presumed mechanism of the pathogenesis of MMD in this patient </plain></SENT>
