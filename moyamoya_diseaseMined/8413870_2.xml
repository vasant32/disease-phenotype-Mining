<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immediate postoperative angiograms were evaluated with reference to whether such <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> could be predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediate postoperative angiograms were taken in 12 patients with large <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> on the day after the operation during which the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In five of six <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> located in the distal cerebral hemisphere, a hypervascular network was seen in the vicinity of the removed nidus on the immediate postoperative angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The unexplained <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in four of the five cases with the hypervascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining six patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>, the hypervascular network was not observed and they did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>; the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were located either close to the arterial circle of Willis or in the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We believe that the hypervascular network seen on the immediate postoperative angiogram after the removal of a large distal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> is an important sign predicting the likelihood of unexplained intraoperative and postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We call this perinidal hypervascular network "modja-modja vessels" because it resembles shaggy hair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of its appearance and the pathogenesis of the unexplained intraoperative and postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are discussed </plain></SENT>
