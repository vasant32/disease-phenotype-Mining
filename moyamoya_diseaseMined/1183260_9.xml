<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These six stages are not observed in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral cervical perivascular sympathectomy (PVS) was performed in 9 children and superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCG) was added unilaterally in 4 and bilaterally in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up studies were carried out 1-7 years following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improvement was observed in most of the cases examined within the first 2 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was not the case in arteriograms performed more than 6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It would seem that PVS and SCG can improve the progress of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels but only for a short period of time </plain></SENT>
