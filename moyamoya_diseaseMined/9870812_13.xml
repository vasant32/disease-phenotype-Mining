<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibrinolytic therapy has been reported to improve overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with severe primary IVH were treated by direct intraventricular injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) into the lateral ventricles, followed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage if the intracranial pressure rose above 20 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 15-month period from 1995 through 1996, 10 patients were treated, (4 male and 6 female, mean age 35 years; range, 21-55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score on admission was 6 (range, 4-8) and the mean Graeb score for severity of IVH on the first CT scan was 10 (range, 8-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was negative in five cases but identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> in three, a post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm in one, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-moya disease</z:e> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean total dose requirement of rt-PA was 8.25 mg (range, 6-12 mg) with a significant reduction in the mean Graeb score after 7 days to 3.9 (range, 2-7, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome at 3 months was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one case (mortality 10%), severe disability in two (20%), moderate disability in three (30%), and good result in four (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients (40%) required subsequent CSF shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No complications of rehemorrhage, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, or catheter obstruction were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraventricular fibrinolysis with rt-PA seems to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe IVH </plain></SENT>
