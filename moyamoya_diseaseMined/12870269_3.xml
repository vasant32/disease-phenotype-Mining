<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical subjects consisted of 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographical stages were classified by the criteria of Suzuki and Takaku </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For examinations, conventional cerebral angiography or magnetic resonance angiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from three months to 17 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found the following results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older patients presented with advanced angiographical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiographical stages were usually progressive in pediatric patients, while stable in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In pediatric cases, the disease advanced to stage V within 10 years from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in certain cases the disease progressed after adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among pediatric patients, certain cases, in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease was later than five years of age, showed relatively <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slow progression</z:hpo> of angiographical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that certain pediatric cases whose disease started after five years of age presented with stable temporal changes in the angiographical stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings might indicate that in only a few adult cases does the disease initiate in adulthood and in the majority of adult patients the disease starts in childhood </plain></SENT>
