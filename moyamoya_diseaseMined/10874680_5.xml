<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed angiograms to evaluate the effect of encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) on abnormally dilated collateral vessels in 13 child patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EMS was performed on 24 sides in 13 patients ranging from 5 to 14 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Post-operative angiography (6-88 months after surgery) revealed good revascularizations through EMS (larger than one-third of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) distribution) in 18 sides (75%) and smaller revascularizations in 6 sides (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cases with a good revascularization through EMS, reduction of the abnormal collateral vessels was observed not only in the basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels (94% of sides) but also in the medullary arteries derived from the choroidal arteries (62% of sides), which are considered to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhages</z:mp> in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that EMS may reduce the hemodynamic load on dilated collateral vessels and, subsequently, the long-term risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
