<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of stenoocclusive lesions in the renal and major abdominal arteries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Abdominal angiography was performed in 73 patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings of abdominal angiography were retrospectively reviewed for the presence and appearance of stenosis in the renal and other major abdominal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four (5%) of 73 patients presented with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients had moderate stenosis, and one patient had mild stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the three patients with moderate stenosis, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> was located in the proximal region of the main branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (3%) with moderate stenosis of the unilateral renal artery had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant differences were observed in age, sex, and the cerebral angiographic stage between patients with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No stenosis was found in the abdominal aorta or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">celiac</z:e>, superior mesenteric, common hepatic, splenic, and proximal common iliac arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No occlusions were found in any abdominal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was 5% (4/73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the proximal region of the renal artery was dominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No stenosis was found in other abdominal arteries </plain></SENT>
