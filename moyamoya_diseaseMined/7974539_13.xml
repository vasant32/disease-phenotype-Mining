<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Present criteria for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> emphasize the use of conventional cerebral angiography as an indispensable requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is fast becoming a reliable diagnostic modality for occlusive cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of MRA compared with conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (23 children and 16 adults) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> confirmed by conventional angiography (78 side views) were examined with MRA (three-dimensional time-of-flight technique with a 256 x 256 or 256 x 512 matrix) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T1- and T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were also taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stenotic or occlusive change at the carotid fork was clearly revealed by MRA, which correlated well with conventional angiography (83% good correlation, 17% overestimation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apparent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were clearly shown as a signal void on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image and fine unusual vessels on MRA, particularly in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were poorly shown on both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images and MRA, particularly in adults (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRA can be an alternative to conventional angiography in typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> cases (the bilateral type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, in the early or the end stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, diagnosis by means of MRA should be carefully evaluated </plain></SENT>
