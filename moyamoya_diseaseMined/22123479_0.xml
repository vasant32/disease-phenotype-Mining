<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated the involvement of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study directly investigated the participation of EPCs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, using specimens of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery collected from two adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specimens were stained with primary antibodies against CD34, CD133, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) to localize the circulating EPCs in the thickened intima of occlusive arterial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD34- and VEGFR2-positive cells were densely found in the thickened intima of occlusive arterial lesion, particularly clustered in the superficial layer of thickened intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the number of CD34- and CD133-positive cells was very small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CD34-positive cells also expressed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor on the surface of thickened intima and were also positive for Î±-smooth muscle actin in the deeper layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that circulating EPCs may be involved in the development of occlusive arterial lesion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
