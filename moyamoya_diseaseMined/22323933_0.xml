<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Structural genetic variation, including copy-number variation (CNV), constitutes a substantial fraction of total genetic variability, and the importance of structural variants in modulating susceptibility is increasingly being recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CNV can change biological function and contribute to pathophysiological conditions of human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its relationship with common, complex human disease in particular is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we searched the human genome to identify copy number variants that predispose to moya-moya type cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who had unilateral or bilateral steno-occlusive lesions at the cerebral artery from March, 2007, to September, 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the 20 subjects, including patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> type pathologies and three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls, we divided the subjects into 4 groups : typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (n=6), unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (n=9), progression unilateral to typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (n=2) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fragmented DNA was hybridized on Human610Quad v1.0 DNA analysis BeadChips (Illumina) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data analysis was performed with GenomeStudio v2009.1, Genotyping 1.1.9, cnvPartition_v2.3.4 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall call rates were more than 99.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 1258 CNVs were identified across the whole genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average number of CNV was 45.55 per subject (CNV region was 45.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The gain/loss of CNV was 52/249, having 4.7 fold higher frequencies in loss calls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The total CNV size was 904,657,868, and average size was 993,038 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The largest portion of CNVs (613 calls) were 1M-10M in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, significant association between unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) and progression of unilateral to typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant association between unilateral MMD and progression of unilateral to typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The finding was confirmed again with clustering analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that certain CNV associate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-type cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
