<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the risk factors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> after cranial irradiation for primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed neuroimaging studies and dosimetry data for 456 children who were treated with radiation for a primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> and who were prospectively evaluated with serial neuroimaging studies and neurologic evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 345 patients had both adequate neuroimaging and radiation dosimetry data for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used survival analysis techniques to examine the relationship of clinically important variables as risk factors for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 12 patients (3.5%) developed evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> was more rapid for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 (NF1) (median of 38 vs 55 months) and for patients who received &gt;5,000 cGy of radiation (median of 42 vs 67 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multiple Cox proportional hazards regression analysis controlling for age at start of radiation, each 100-cGy increase in radiation dose increased the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> by 7% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.13, p = 0.01) and the presence of NF1 increased the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> threefold (HR = 3.07, 95% CI: 0.90 to 10.46, p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya syndrome</z:e> is a potentially serious complication of cranial irradiation in children, particularly for those patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in close proximity to the circle of Willis, such as optic pathway <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who received higher doses of radiation to the circle of Willis and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 have increased risk of the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
