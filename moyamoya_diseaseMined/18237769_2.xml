<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old man, who had been affected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> during the past 3 years, was admitted to our hospital because of crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> with numbness in his right hand and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography showed apparent progression of the steno-occlusive changes bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then planned surgical revascularization on the symptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the time of readmission for surgery, an asymptomatic small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the right frontal cortex was found, which presented on MRI as a CCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram showed avascular lesion corresponding to the location of CCM as well as a newly formed venous malformation on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One month later, STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with pial synangiosis was performed without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in CBF on the left hemisphere was confirmed by postoperative single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no ischemic changes on a postoperative MRI, and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was apparently patent by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> completely disappeared after surgery, and the patient was discharged without neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistence of the CCM and venous malformation were confirmed by T2*-weighted image and 3-dimensional contrast-enhanced gradient echo/SWI 4 months after surgery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> with CCM and venous malformation is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The coincidence of the progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> with these newly formed vascular malformations may give a clue to the underlying mechanism of the progression of this rare entity </plain></SENT>
