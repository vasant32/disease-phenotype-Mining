<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When unrecognized and untreated, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> in children can have serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To review the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> and computed tomography angiographic (CTA) findings in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight CTAs from January 2004 to March 2008 of 23 children and adolescents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were reviewed for the causes and CTA findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of the 23 children (39%) had abnormal renal arteries with or without abnormal abdominal aortas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of these children had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039263" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Takayasu</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and one had median arcuate ligament syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0011403'>pyelonephritis</z:mp> had severe stenosis of the proximal right renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other two children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> with a nonspecific cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One child with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> abdominal aorta and renal arteries had a right suprarenal mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On pathological examination a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003005'>ganglioneuroma</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CTA can help in diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo> in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although CTA is not a screening modality, it is appropriate in some situations </plain></SENT>
