<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the age distribution patterns of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> showed two peaks similar to that of definite cases, the pattern shifted to the right thus indicating a reversed children versus adult ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The female/male ratio was 1.65, which was not significantly different from that observed in definite cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The family occurrence rate was 6.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in probable cases was higher than that in definite cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was higher in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographically probable cases were at earlier stages in comparison to definite cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rebuild-up phenomenon in electroencephalograms was less detectable than in definite cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures were performed in 63.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and approximately 81% of them underwent bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Single encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis, direct bypass and combined bypass procedures were performed in 35, 40 and 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgical cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was higher in the probable cases, the outcomes of the patients were similar to that of the definite cases except for mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately 7% of the probable cases developed into definite type within an average 6.6 year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The majority of probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> cases thus seems to have somewhat different clinical characteristics from the definite disease cases </plain></SENT>
