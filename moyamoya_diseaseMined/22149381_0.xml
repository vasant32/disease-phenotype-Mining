<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> complain of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, which may be closely related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis in these patients was evaluated by clinicoradiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of 117 consecutive patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 25 complained mainly of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group) and 92 had no significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (nonheadache group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intensity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was evaluated pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) were assessed pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group was significantly younger than the nonheadache group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a group corrected for the age distribution, preoperative rCBF and CVR were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and nonheadache groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> experienced complete relief from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, 7 patients showed remarkable improvements and discontinued medications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and the remaining 2 patients had some alleviation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> but sometimes required medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> group, the postoperative rCBF was significantly greater than the preoperative value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative rCBF in this group was also significantly greater than the postoperative rCBF in the nonheadache group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> is one of the main symptoms in young patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> probably related to cerebral circulatory disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis is effective in relieving <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> manifesting severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, probably by improving perfusion pressure and cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
