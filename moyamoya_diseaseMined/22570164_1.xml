<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>/syndrome (MM) have a high rate of recurrent arterial ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e>; surgical revascularisation (SR) has the potential to prevent this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe our experience of SR for childhood mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of case notes and radiology of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> who underwent SR at our centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-three children with MM and who had SR were identified, with median age at presentation of 4.75 years (range 0.6-14.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with &gt;1 AIS or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) and who had not infarcted the whole territory of the diseased carotid artery were offered SR, with the primary aim of preventing further AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-four SR procedures were undertaken: 82 indirect (62.4 %) and 49 (37.6 %) direct procedures with 3 second SR procedures following initial SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median age at surgery was 7.3 (1-18.2) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One anticoagulated child developed an intracranial haemorrhage on the fifth post-operative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median duration of follow-up was 34 (5-166) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three children (4.1 %) had recurrent AIS (one silent) after SR; two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> had intracranial haemorrhage 1.5 and 11 months post-SR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> improved in 42 out of 53 (79.2 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our experience of SR for paediatric MM is comparable to other large series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SR is safe, and the rate of recurrent AIS after SR is lower than would be anticipated, on the basis of known natural history of MM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no observed difference in outcome of recurrent AIS for direct versus indirect procedures in this series </plain></SENT>
