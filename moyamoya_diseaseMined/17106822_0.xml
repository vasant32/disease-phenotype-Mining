<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We present 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and their evolution from an early age to adulthood in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients (nine females and three males) were first studied before 10 years of age because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid and vertebrobasilar arteriographies were performed during initial evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients who were followed-up during several or many years (in one, during 33 years and, in two, during 25 years), neuroimaging studies were done by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient also had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 (NF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed bilateral occlusion of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery was markedly narrowed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient with very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms also showed collateral vascularization through the Bernasconi- Cassinari artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral multifocal cortical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> were seen in the patients who had very long follow-up, although these already had appeared in the first <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient showed arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> 31 images and fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She was the only patient treated surgically during childhood with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after a short time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another patient had a pregnancy and vaginal delivery at 26 years of age without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Images of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> did not disappear in any of the patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> medication in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except in one who had NF1 and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although it is difficult to demonstrate the efficacy of calcium-<z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> medication (nicardipine), we found that it improved the neurological symptoms in most of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of the patients in this series showed some neurological problems, although most of them did well, including those cases with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adult patients in this series were working, although some of them in low qualified jobs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Collateral vascularization was very marked in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except in one who also showed fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> images did not disappear in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> seem to be underlying the cause of the neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> responded well to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> medication </plain></SENT>
