<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two SPECT measurements were performed serially, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was administered between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of increase in hemispheric blood volume was calculated, and it was compared with the results of cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cerebral vasodilatory capacity map, the image after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> minus the baseline image, was also produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> increased hemispheric blood volume in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> than in the uninvolved hemispheres of the patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio of concordance with blood flow and blood volume measurements was approximated at 80% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SPECT measurements of cerebral blood volume after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> can be performed following baseline SPECT with no additional radiotracer, and may be helpful to assess hemodynamic status </plain></SENT>
