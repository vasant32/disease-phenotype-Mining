<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples were freshly obtained at operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small piece of the sample was placed on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and, using an operative microscope, the production of neovascularization was evaluated 96 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scalp artery (STA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) showed the highest activity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, followed by the omentum and galea, while the temporal muscle, dura mater, and fat tissue showed poor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination confirmed the development of vasculature in CAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The production of neovascularization is known to be related to the tissue content of the angiogenic factor (AF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AF is known to be present in the vascular endothelial cell, fibroblast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006118" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor, brain</z:e>, or omentum, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rationale for the selection of materials for the neovascularization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was discussed in relation to its ability to produce new vessels </plain></SENT>
