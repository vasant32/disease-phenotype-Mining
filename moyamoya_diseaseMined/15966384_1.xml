<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is a rare neurovascular disorder that requires special <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> managements during revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the incidence of early postoperative complications under inhaled anesthesia in comparison with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two patients undergoing revascularization procedures were divided into two groups, one with inhaled anesthesia (n = 23) and the other with TIVA (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical procedures were performed under normocapnia, proper body temperature, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were prevented from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> by homologous transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To avoid the variance in <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> managements, 39 patients under 15 years of age were picked up and divided in the same way as above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> during the first 2 weeks after operation were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, early postoperative complications occurred in 48% of inhaled anesthesia group and in 49% of TIVA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients under 15, these complications occurred in 44% and in 57%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Several previous studies reported the excellence of TIVA for revascularization procedure on the basis of regional blood flow because inhaled anesthesia may provoke intracerebral steal in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our investigation in this study revealed that both <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> methods have no significant difference in postoperative complications during the first 2 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus further study should be needed to verify the safety of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38870">inhalation anesthetics</z:chebi> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
