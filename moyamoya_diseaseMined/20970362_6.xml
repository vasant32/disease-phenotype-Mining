<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the coincidence of mutations in ACTA2 (vascular smooth muscle cell specific isoform of Î±-actin) in families with thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> and dissections (TAAD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) was reported in patients of Northern European descent and a positive family history for TAAD and MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the nine exons of the ACTA2 gene in central European patients with non-familial MMD, aiming to replicate previously described genetic findings and possibly identify further mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of the nine exons and flanking intronic regions of ACTA2 was performed in 39 MMD patients with no family history for MMD or TAAD and 68 healthy controls of central European descent with custom made primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One new mutation (R179H, heterozygous) in exon 6 of ACTA2 was found in one patient with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We were not able to detect other previously described mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a previous report, we did not identify significant sequence variations in ACTA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further combined analysis of ACTA2 and other, possibly causative, genes in larger cohorts of MMD and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> may identify possible common disease-causing mechanisms </plain></SENT>
