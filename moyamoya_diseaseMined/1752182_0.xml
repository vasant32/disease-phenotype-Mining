<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical and pathological features of 20 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> complicated with primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (PIVH) and verified by CT scanning, cerebral angiography and autopsy were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seemed to the author that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> appeared to be prone to cause PIVH, this <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> being likely due to ischemic malacia in the ventricular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The tortuous, abnormal network vessels ruptured and bled as a result of infarction and damage of the walls of the miliary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PIVH might be divided into two types: the panventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and partial ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, according to the amount of blood that filled into the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>6 cases of the panventricular type were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The symptoms were in conformity with the traditional concept of the most critical, <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The external ventricular drainage in combination with lumber puncture drainage would be the better way of treatment for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>14 cases of the partial ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> type showed the clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treatment was similar to SAH too, and the prognosis was much better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It would be worth noting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be a factor not to be neglected in causing PIVH </plain></SENT>
