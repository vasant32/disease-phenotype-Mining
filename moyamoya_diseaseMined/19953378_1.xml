<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Various types of revascularization surgery have been performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the efficacies of these operations are well recognized, the optimal operative procedure remains undecided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe our modified surgical revascularization procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and retrospectively analyze the results of such surgeries on six sides in six adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our operative procedure, combining direct and indirect bypasses, is a superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis is an indirect bypass combining the encephalo-duro- and encephalo-myo-synangioses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This operative procedure has been used routinely in adult patients since 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative complications were noted in one of the six operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This complication was transient and no attributive lesions were detected on CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was seen in cerebral blood flow studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the clinical outcomes were excellent or good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Effective neovascularization through the grafts was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in follow-up angiographies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This operative procedure provides needed revascularization and prevents ischemic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This modified procedure is useful for responding to subsequent additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the area of the anterior cerebral artery and should be considered one of the optimal procedures for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
