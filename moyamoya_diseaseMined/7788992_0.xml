<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and 12 patients with unilateral or bilateral cerebrovascular disease were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the injection of radiolabeled human serum albumin, dynamic imaging of the anterior view of the head was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes later, 1000 mg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> index (the percent increase in activity at the peak response) was obtained for each cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> index in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects was 17.1 +/- 3.2% (N = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The value was significantly lower in patients with multiple <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (7.7 +/- 1.1%, N = 8, P &lt; 0.001), and below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in two involved hemispheres of five patients with unilateral occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and in three hemispheres of three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that this simple method may be useful in assessing cerebral vasodilatory capacity in both unilateral and bilateral diseases </plain></SENT>
