<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined changes in biological characteristics and responsiveness to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> during the in vitro cellular aging of arterial smooth muscle cell strains derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (HMSMC) and compared them with those of cells from age-matched control patients (HCSMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HMSMC had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human diploid chromosome constitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HMSMC and HCSMC had almost the same in vitro life span and the age-related patterns of biological parameters were essentially the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the doubling time at the early passages was significantly longer in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMC than control SMC, although there was no significant difference at the late passages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the poor responsiveness of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMC to platelet-derived growth factor was retained throughout the life span in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that functional alterations in vascular cells are involved in the mechanism of development of intimal thickening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
