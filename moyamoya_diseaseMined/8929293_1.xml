<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients (four female, one male) were studied utilizing <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 iodoamphetamine or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data were reconstructed into axial, coronal and sagittal sections for review, and compared with CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and/or angiographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five patients had significant perfusion defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These areas of vascular compromise were seen to cross <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular territories, and were greater in number and extent than seen on anatomic sectional imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have a recognizable pattern of scintigraphic perfusion deficits which should be identified by pediatric imaging physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPECT perfusion studies should be performed in conjunction with other imaging modalities (CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or angiography) </plain></SENT>
