<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Whether a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is justified in patients with typical angiographic evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> unilaterally and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiographic findings contralaterally remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors analyzed longitudinal angiographic change, familial occurrence, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with "unilateral" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a 10-year period, 10 cases of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were followed using conventional angiography or magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Basic FGF in CSF, obtained from the subarachnoid space of the cerebral cortex during revascularization surgery, was measured in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the 10 cases of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, only one pediatric case showed obvious signs of progression to typical bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other nine cases (including six adults and three children) remained stable throughout follow-up radiological examinations (magnetic resonance angiography) with a mean observation period of 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no familial occurrence in these cases of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of bFGF, which are high in typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, were low in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progression from unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> to the typical bilateral form of the disease appears to be infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low levels of bFGF in the CSF of these patients and the lack of familial occurrence strongly suggest that most cases of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, especially those found in adults, are distinct from typical bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
