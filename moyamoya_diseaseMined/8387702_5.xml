<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined the expression of thrombomodulin, a recently isolated <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> protein, in endothelial cells from patients with spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular moyamoya disease</z:e>) to determine whether lack of the expression of thrombomodulin might lead to the thrombogenicity in patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The intracranial internal carotid arteries, the external carotid arteries, and the vertebral or basilar arteries from 12 autopsied patients who had this disease and eight control autopsied patients were examined immunohistochemically by using the antiserum against human thrombomodulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the endothelial cells from the patients with this disease and from the control patients were positive for thrombomodulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunoelectron microscopy also disclosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> localization of thrombomodulin on the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> plasma membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemically, we could find no significant differences in the expression of thrombomodulin among the arteries examined in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that as far as we investigated immunohistochemically, the thrombogenicity in this disease is almost unlikely to depend on the abnormal expression of thrombomodulin </plain></SENT>
