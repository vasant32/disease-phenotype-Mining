<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report on a patient born <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>small for gestational age</z:hpo> (SGA) with severe, proportionate <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo>, discreet signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial genetic evaluation revealed a novel heterozygous IGF1R p.Leu1361Arg mutation affecting a highly conserved residue with the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor suggestive for a disturbance within the somatotropic axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, because the mutation did not co-segregate with the phenotype and functional characterization did not reveal an obvious impairment of the ligand depending major IGF1R signaling capabilities a second-site mutation was assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutational screening of components of the somatotropic axis, constituents of the IGF signaling system and factors involved in cellular proliferation, which are described or suggested to provoke syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003510'>dwarfism</z:hpo> phenotypes, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two compound heterozygous PCNT mutations (p.[Arg585X];[Glu1774X]) were identified leading to the specification of the diagnosis to MOPD II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These investigations underline the need for careful assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available information to derive a firm diagnosis from a sequence aberration </plain></SENT>
