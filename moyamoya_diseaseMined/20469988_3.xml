<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study were to confirm the presence of dysexecutive cognitive syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e>) in adults with MMD and to explore the relationship of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> with frontal lobe perfusion as measured by perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio and mean transit time delay were measured in frontal and temporoparietal regions using the cerebellum as a reference region in 10 European adults with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the authors calculated the cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) using the CBV ratio and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a standardized neuropsychological assessment test battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> as an impairment shown on 3 tests or more of executive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frontal CVR was lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> than in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> (mean ± SD: -13.5 ± 13.2% and 20.3 ± 21.3%; p = 0.019, Mann-Whitney U-test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other parameters of frontal perfusion and temporoparietal CVR were not correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DCS</z:e> is common in European adults with MMD and may be related to frontal perfusion impairment </plain></SENT>
