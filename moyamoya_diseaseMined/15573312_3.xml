<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Ischemic vascular pathologies are predominant among the neurological processes associated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of the venous sinuses, Moya-moya syndrome and <z:mp ids='MP_0002191'>arterial dysplasia</z:mp>, among others, stand out for their association with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 19-year-old female patient suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> who visited because of deficiency symptoms of an ischemic origin; diagnosis was based on angiographic disorders compatible with Moya-moya syndrome in the left carotid tree and <z:mp ids='MP_0002191'>arterial dysplasia</z:mp> in the right carotid tree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data concerning the medical history, physical examination, complementary tests, treatment applied and evaluation of the patient's clinical progress are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the patient was also diagnosed as suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1698092" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves-Basedow disease</z:e>, which is contemplated in the aetiological study carried out on these and other vascular anomalies and which have often been described in relation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The particular interest of our case lies in the fact that the two pathological processes occur in the same patient, although only one of them was symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of these vascular anomalies have been described in association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> separately, but the simultaneous presence of both of them in the same patient is infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest the possibility of a common aetiological link between the two processes, which in turn accounts for their association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
