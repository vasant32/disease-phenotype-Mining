<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are few detailed demographic and clinical data about Chinese patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the most effective treatment in adult patients with MMD is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have only been a few small case series reporting on encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) in an adult population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the clinical features, surgical treatment and long-term outcome of adults with MMD treated at a single institution in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our cohort included 470 adult patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained by retrospective chart review and long-term outcome was evaluated using the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to determine the neurological functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors for postoperative morbidity and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression was used to determine risk factors for postoperative or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 36.8 (range, 18-59) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ratio of female to male patients was 1:1 (231/239) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Familial occurrence of MMD was 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The most common initial symptom was a cerebral ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative ischemic events or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was 5.9% (9.8% of patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Older age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) involvement and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) were identified as predictors of adverse postoperative events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk was 10.1% in the first 2 years, and the 5-year Kaplan-Meier risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 13% after surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Older age at symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> involvement and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> were identified as predictors of postoperative or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Overall, 73.2% of patients had an independent life with no significant disability, with the strongest predictor being the preoperative mRS score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics of adult MMD in China are different from those in other Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>EDAS in adult patients with MMD carries a low risk, is effective at preventing future ischemic events and improves quality of life </plain></SENT>
