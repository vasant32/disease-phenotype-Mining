<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>First, delayed venous filling and the divisional change of the superficial cerebral veins have been attributed to the development of collateral pathways in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and may be reflective appearances for the pathophysiological conditions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Particularly, delayed venous filling may be an important finding which predicts an ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Secondarily, the inferior striate veins were frequently detected in proportion to the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the superior striate veins were prominent in the decrement stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings may give support to the pathological findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels that there were observed various degrees of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> with venous-like vessels as well as dilated perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
