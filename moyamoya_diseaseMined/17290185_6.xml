<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) is a cerebrovascular occlusive disease characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion at the distal ends of the bilateral internal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In MMD, intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> was previously reported to be found in autopsy samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study focusing on the mechanism of remodeling of the intracranial arterial walls of patients with MMD, we surgically collected tiny pieces of the wall of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) from patients with MMD and analyzed them using histological and immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients underwent surgical procedures for treatment of standard indications of MMD at Kyoto University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specimens of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were obtained from MMD patients during the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> samples were also obtained in the same way from control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> specimens from MMD patients had a thicker intima than those from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In MMD samples, the immunoreactivity indicating <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducing factor-1alpha was higher in the endothelium and intima; endoglin expression was also higher in the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No vascular endothelial growth factor immunoreactivity was detectable in the MMD samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, transforming growth factor-beta3 immunoreactivity was also detected and was co-localized with that of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducing factor-1alpha and endoglin, mainly in the endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> specimens from MMD patients had thicker intimal walls than the specimens from control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducing factor-1alpha and endoglin were overexpressed in the intima of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of MMD patients </plain></SENT>
