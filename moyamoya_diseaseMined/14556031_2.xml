<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its precise mechanism remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, MEG, MRI, and SPECT were used to clarify its mechanism in 4 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous magnetic brain activity was measured using a whole-head MEG system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quantified dipole distribution was shown on 3D-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The original current dipoles of the "re-build up" slow waves were predominantly located in the deep cortical sulci in the area with impaired reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the re-build up waves derive from the deep cortical sulci due to the reduction in the cerebral perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
