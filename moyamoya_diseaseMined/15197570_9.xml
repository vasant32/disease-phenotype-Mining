<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The dynamic process of neovascularization seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who have received bypass surgery has not been sufficiently elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)is expected to disclose this process since it can be conducted frequently because of its non-invasive nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we prospectively investigated postoperative neovascularization using repeated MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 14 pediatric patients (23 sides) who have received both direct bypass surgery of the superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery and indirect surgery of encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis during the past 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRA was performed using a 1.5-T machine, image sequences of 512 x 256 resolution, and the time-of-flight method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRA was prospectively performed preoperatively and repeated 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A tendency toward a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels and the development of the STA was observed 1 month after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Development of the deep temporal artery and the middle meningeal artery was observed 3 months after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progression of stenotic change was apparently accelerated after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A reciprocal relation between neovascularization artificially induced by bypass surgery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels, which are supposed to compensate for the stenotic change of the internal carotid artery, was disclosed </plain></SENT>
