<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, as a consequence of this disorder, is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One should be clear as to the diagnostic and neuroimaging criteria of 'definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: A 52 year old man with a family history of two brothers having died of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> and a personal history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> for many years and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was sent to us with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, neck stiffness+4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> in time and space and stuporous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On cranial CAT scan a small left intraventricular subependymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed the angiographic pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and the arterial circulation of the posterior territory was highly developed and thus supplemented the blood supply to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In few of the rare occurrence of this disorder in our setting and as a cause of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp>, we reviewed certain neuroradiological peculiarities of interest, such as the evolution, diagnostic criteria, angiographic classification and differential diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> in relation to our case </plain></SENT>
