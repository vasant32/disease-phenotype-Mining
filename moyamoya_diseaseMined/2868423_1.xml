<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>8 cases were operated, 2 by direct neck occlusion and 6 others by carotid or vertebral interruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For the nine non operated cases 5 were in a very bad clinical condition and 4 had refused the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Aneurysmal neck occlusion gave uneventful results lasting more than 4 and 10 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one case, the post operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> happened after 8 days of well tolerated carotid occlusion and in spite of a functional extra-intra-cranial anastomosis </plain></SENT>
