<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study was performed to evaluate the rate of recurrent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> with respect to prothrombotic risk factors and underlying clinical conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a series of 215 consecutively enrolled neonates with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS), the factor V G1691A mutation, factor II G20210A variant, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25297">methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) T677T genotype, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (Lp) (a), antithrombin, protein C, protein S, and anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient median follow-up was 3.5 years (range, 1 to 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 7 infants and children (3.3%) showed recurrent symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> (AIS, n=4; venous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, n=2; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> of the leg, n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The factor V mutation, factor II variant, elevated Lp(a) &gt;30 mg/dL, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, and protein S or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272375" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antithrombin deficiency</z:e> were associated with first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 of 7 cases (71.4%), prothrombotic risk factors [MTHFR T677T, elevated Lp(a), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598608" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperhomocysteinemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>] were involved at the time of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a second thromboembolic event was triggered additionally by underlying diseases (71%), eg, cardiac malformation and immobilization, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data shown here give evidence that symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004831'>recurrent thromboembolism</z:hpo> is not common in children with neonatal AIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risk of a second event, however, is increased when underlying diseases occur and prothrombotic risk factors are involved </plain></SENT>
