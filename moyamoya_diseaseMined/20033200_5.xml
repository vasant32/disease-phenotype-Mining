<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We wanted to determine the neurocognitive profile of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> prior to neurosurgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The experience of three United States medical centers, Columbia University, University of Illinois at Chicago, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, were combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical data from adult patients (N = 29) referred for neuropsychological evaluation from 1996 to 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using standardized neuropsychological tests and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data were converted to z-scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Memory, attention, processing speed, verbal memory, visuo-spatial, language, and executive functions were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> was defined as performance in two or more cognitive domains 1.5 standard deviations below age-corrected normative means OR one or more cognitive domains two standard deviations below age-corrected normative means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Manual strength and dexterity, as well as depressive symptoms, were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of patients demonstrated neurocognitive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of patients were found to have pronounced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> (&gt;2 SD below the mean) on tests of processing speed (29%), verbal memory (31%), verbal fluency (26%) and executive function (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Manual strength and dexterity were also affected in many patients, with impairment found in 36-58% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight percent of patients reported moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, but depressive symptoms did not correlate with neurocognitive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A large proportion of adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> demonstrate disruption of neurocognition in a broad range of functions, particularly those mediated by subcortical and frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The pattern of deficits suggests a mechanism of diffuse small vessel disease possibly caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
