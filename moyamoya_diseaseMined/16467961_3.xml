<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis has been used to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MD) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> ischaemic disease (non-MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is yet known regarding the difference between these groups of patients in the extent to which the bypass contributes to maintaining adequate cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO), or the temporal changes after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we evaluated the CBO changes induced by bypass blood flow in patients with MD and non-MD during the peri-operative periods employing optical spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We investigated 13 patients who underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, including 5 MD and 8 non-MD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of STA blood flow on the CBO in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on the anastomosis side, employing visual light spectroscopy during surgery and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) at one week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In 4 MD patients and one non-MD patient, the STA blood flow increased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhaemoglobin</z:chebi> and cortical oxygen saturation (CoSO2), indicating that the bypass supplied blood flow to the ischaemic brain; the CBO changes were observed more frequently in MD than in non-MD patients (p&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pre-anastomosis CoSO2 (65.4+/-5.4%) in MD was significantly lower than that (72.8+/-7.6%) in non-MD (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative NIRS demonstrated that the bypass began to supply blood flow to the brain in 5 non-MD patients whose bypass did not supply blood flow during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although MD has vessels of small diameter as compared to non-MD, the bypass begins to supply blood flow to the ischaemic brain earlier in MD than in non-MD after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fact that the CoSO2 in MD was lower than that in non-MD suggested that the perfusion pressure in MD was lower than that in non-MD, and this might account for the difference in the bypass blood supply after anastomosis between MD and non-MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that, even if the bypass does not supply blood to the brain during surgery in non-MD, the bypass blood flow gradually increases after surgery </plain></SENT>
