<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To prospectively evaluate differences in detectability of cerebral microbleeds (MBs) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and T2*-weighted imaging (T2*WI) at 3 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: SWI and T2*WI were applied for 50 consecutive MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MB was defined as a very low signal intensity area in each sequence without continuity from surrounding vessel structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Numbers of MBs were compared between the 2 sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess visualization, a grading score was assigned to each MB from Grade 3 (prominent) to Grade 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing) on SWI and T2*WI, respectively, and were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 37 MBs were detected in 21 patients (42%) on SWI, compared with 27 MBs in 16 patients (32%) on T2*WI, with significant difference in number of MBs between the 2 sequences (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lesions displayed greater visual grading score on SWI than on T2*WI (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SWI offers better detectability of MBs in MMD than T2*WI at 3 T </plain></SENT>
