<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine sets of FLAIR and postcontrast T1-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were available in 19 consecutive children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary moyamoya disease</z:e> confirmed with conventional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced FLAIR <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images also were available in 15 sets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two pediatric radiologists reviewed FLAIR and postcontrast T1-weighted images in separate sessions for the leptomeningeal ivy sign and assigned a rating of "present," "absent," or "equivocal" by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unenhanced and contrast-enhanced FLAIR <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were compared side by side to determine which better depicted leptomeningeal high signal intensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postcontrast T1-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images revealed the leptomeningeal ivy sign in 40 hemispheres (frequency of visualization, 71% [40 of 56 hemispheres]), whereas unenhanced FLAIR <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images depicted it in 26 hemispheres (frequency of visualization, 46% [26 of 56 hemispheres]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An equivocal rating was given in 21 hemispheres versus in 11 on FLAIR and postcontrast T1-weighted images, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FLAIR and postcontrast T1-weighted images agreed in 40 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no case with a positive rating on FLAIR images when postcontrast T1-weighted images were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unenhanced FLAIR <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was superior to contrast-enhanced FLAIR imaging in seven hemispheres, whereas enhanced FLAIR was better in four of 28 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 17, findings with each sequence were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images are better than FLAIR images for depicting the leptomeningeal ivy sign in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
