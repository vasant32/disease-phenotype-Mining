<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During surgery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> has been encountered infrequently just after opening of the dura mater, while mild or moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> is frequently found just after opening of the dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four out of 866 cases operated on by the first author in the last twenty-two years showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> and the operation had to be completed as soon as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> just after opening of the dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide gas (ETCO(2), mmHg) was measured and recorded just before induction of general anesthesia (preETCO(2)) and just after opening of the dura mater (postETCO(2)) in fourteen patients operated on for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distance between the opened dural edge and the top of the swelled brain surface (dbs, mm) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between increase in ETCO(2) (x, defined as postETCO(2) minus preETCO(2)) and dbs (y) was investigated and it was revealed that there was a significant positive correlation between the two parameters (y=2.59+0.31x, n=14, r=0.65048, p=0.01177&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It means that decrease in carbon dioxide gas tension in various degrees before operation was normalized abruptly by the anesthesiologist and the increase in carbon dioxide gas tension was thought to increase in cerebral blood flow abruptly, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
