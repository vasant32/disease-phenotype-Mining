<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> extracranial/intracranial (EC/IC) bypass surgery has been done and the results of the surgery have been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism(s) underlying <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> and the therapeutic modalities used to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> have not been well elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have retrospectively analysed 45 cases with intracranial haemorrhage among 192 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> treated and followed at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the initial patients with haemorrhage did not provide any new information other than the already reported theories about the origin and mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 15 patients in whom haemorrhage occurred at least twice suggested that there were two different mechanisms of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One group consisted of 7 cases, where haemorrhages were confined to the original <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 of these 7 cases a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was identified at the periphery of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1 case a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found on a major vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 other cases no source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 of these cases rebleeding occurred within 2 months after the initial ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second group consisted of 8 cases where haemorrhage occurred repeatedly but at variable sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In none of these cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> identified to suggest the source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases rebleeding occurred more than 2 months after the initial ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> may occur as a result of rupture of a tiny <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> situated at the periphery of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels and which may have been destroyed after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>If the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> persist after rupture they may re-rupture after a fairly short interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In other cases <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurs at different sites from the initial haemorrhage; these are considered to be a result of rupture of weak <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels which are forced to act as collateral pathways and are under unusually increased haemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>EC/IC bypass surgery is considered to be effective for the prevention of rebleeding in both groups of patients but in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Direct surgery is recommended when a peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is found on a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessel which has bled once </plain></SENT>
