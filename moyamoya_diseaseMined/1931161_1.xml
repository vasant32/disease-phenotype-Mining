<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recent development of a new radiopharmaceutical 123 I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>), which is taken up by the brain from the blood flow, has offered a possibility of constructing scintigraphy maps of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical utility of this method in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, who were examined by <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT before and after bypass operations, were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> images before operations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed focal or global decrease of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a good correlation between the area and degree of rCBF abnormalities and severity of clinical symptoms and stage on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area of rCBF decrease coincided with the dominant area of rebuild-up phenomena on EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> images just after operations, the rCBF changed for the worse transiently in three patients, and the crossed cerebellar diaschisis appeared in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> images 3 months after operations, the rCBF increased in company with the improvement of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased rCBF on the point of operation was recognized in two patients with good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT is a noninvasive and useful method of assessing the effects of therapy as well as the characteristic hemodynamic abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
