<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CSF from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients contained significantly higher concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The b-FGF level was apparently elevated in patients with well developed neovascularization after indirect revascularization surgery (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other angiogenic factors were not significantly elevated compared with those of the control group </plain></SENT>
