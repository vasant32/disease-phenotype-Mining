<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This disease is characterized by progressive intracranial vascular obliterations of the circle of Willis, resulting in successive ischemic or hemorrhagic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> primarily occurs among orient people (Japanese, Koreans, Caucasians) and is very rare in Lithuania </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate long-term effectiveness of cerebral revascularization in order to prevent cerebral ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 1995, 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been treated at the Clinic of Neurosurgery of Kaunas University of Medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent neurological examination, computed tomography or/and magnetic resonance imaging, transcranial Doppler sonography, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography and four vessels cerebral angiography investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was confirmed by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was observed in 7 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was detected in the other 7 moyamoya disease patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological disability was evaluated using the Scandinavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, and performance in the active daily life using the Barthel Index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of handicap was assessed with the Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Different surgical procedures (superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis, encephalosynangiosis, bifrontal free omental flap) were applied for cerebral revascularization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was confirmed by cerebral angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were selected for surgical brain revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The main criterion for selection of patients for surgery was hypoperfusion of the brain on single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During follow-up period (mean follow-up period was 36 months) there were no rebleeding or ischemic events in both surgical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral angiography is the main diagnostic procedure which confirms the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> on single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography is the main criterion for selection of patients for cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Extra-intracranial anastomosis is an effective procedure for preventing both ischemic and hemorrhagic events in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
