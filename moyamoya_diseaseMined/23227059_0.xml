<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The benefits of revascularization surgery, whether direct or indirect, have been well established in MMD patients with ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In adults, the increase in cerebral blood flow achieved with indirect revascularization is often unsatisfactory, and direct revascularization is usually feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In children, however, direct revascularization is frequently technically not feasible, whereas the response to indirect revascularization is excellent, although 1 or 2 weeks are required for stabilization of symptoms </plain></SENT>
