<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To increase the blood flow of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territories, we modified the "ribbon" procedure in combination with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is referred to as "EDAS with bifrontal encephalogaleo(periosteal)synangiosis (EGS)." The surgical technique, clinical outcomes, complications, extent of revascularization, and changes in CBF in 67 pediatric MMD patients were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The excellent and good clinical recovery rates were 57% and 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rate for complete disappearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> was 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the bifrontal EGS made abundant collateral vessels in the ACA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the EDAS with bifrontal EGS was performed in the first operation, collaterals of EGS sites developed more on the contralateral side of the EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The arachnoid opening of the medial frontal lobe in the EGS site had no effect on the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between the clinical outcome and the extent of angiographic revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the CBF and the reserve in ACA territory were observed in 57% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EDAS with bifrontal EGS resulted in excellent revascularization in both the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The clinical and hemodynamic results were also excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This procedure may be an effective and safe surgical modality for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the whole territory of the anterior circulation of the brain in pediatric MMD </plain></SENT>
