<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the medium and long-term outcomes of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MD) undergoing surgery and conservative treatment at a single institution and analyze the related prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted for 97 MD patients at Beijing Tiantan Hospital from January 2000 to December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 3 groups according to treatments: superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis (n = 31), indirect vascular revascularization group (n = 38) and conservative treatment group (n = 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary follow-up events included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004968'>recurrent cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were available for analysis with the complete follow-up data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period of was 85 Â± 38 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In total, there were 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality (6.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, 5 (5.1%) patients died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004968'>recurrent cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And 17 episodes of rebleeding occurred in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> were found in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The risk of rebleeding was 17.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group, 23(74%) cases had excellent recovery, 5 cases fared worse and there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among the patients undergoing indirect vascular revascularization, 28 cases recovered favorably, 4 cases progressed and 3 cases died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the conservative treatment group, 17 patients recovered favorably, 7 progressed, 9 experienced 15 episodes of rebleeding and 3 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the method of treatment was an independent prognostic factor for MD and surgical revascularization was superior to conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the patient age, gender, familial history, unilateral or bilateral and prognosis (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk analysis showed the risk of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the revascularization surgery group was lower than that in the conservative group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>And no difference existed between STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and indirect arterial anastamoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rebleeding is a major cause of poor prognosis, mobility and mortality in MD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization offers better long-term outcomes than conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>And direct arterial anastamoses may decrease recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> effectively </plain></SENT>
