<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings, including a characteristic stenosis of the internal carotid arteries in conjunction with abundant collateral vessel development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients often present with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, leading to rapid diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, children usually present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, which may prove more difficult to diagnose because of patient's inadequate verbal and other skills, leading to delayed recognition of the underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The progression of disease can be slow, with rare, intermittent events, or it can be fulminant, with rapid neurologic decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, regardless of the course, it is apparent that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, both in terms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> and clinical symptoms, inevitably progresses in untreated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery is generally recommended for the treatment of patients with recurrent or progressive cerebral ischemic events and associated reduced cerebral perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many different operative techniques have been described, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with the main goal of preventing further ischemic injury by increasing collateral blood flow to hypoperfused areas of the cortex, using the external carotid circulation as a donor supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This article discusses the various treatment approaches, with an emphasis on the use of pial synangiosis, a method of indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of pial synangiosis is a safe, effective, and durable method of cerebral revascularization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> and should be considered as a primary treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>, especially in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
