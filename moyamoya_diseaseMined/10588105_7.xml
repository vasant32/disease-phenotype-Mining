<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the mechanism behind this enhancement is caused by a retrograde slow flow of engorged pial vasculature via leptomeningeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether the precise source of a high signal on FLAIR images is attributable to pial vessels themselves or congested thickening of the leptomeninges or both </plain></SENT>
