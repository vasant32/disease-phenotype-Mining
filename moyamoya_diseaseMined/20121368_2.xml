<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors used postoperative superselective angiography to assess the relative contributions of the middle meningeal artery (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) and the superficial temporal artery (STA) to revascularization following surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the neurosurgical database at the Hospital for Sick Children, the authors reviewed the clinical and pre- and postoperative angiographic records obtained in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> undergoing superselective angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were 16 years of age or younger and were undergoing revascularization surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lateral internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, STA, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> angiograms were analyzed in the late arterial phase to assess the relative contributions of the STA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> to overall revascularization as determined by the external carotid artery injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> surgical revascularization experience at the Hospital for Sick Children over a 12-year period (May 1996-December 2008) comprised 33 patients (20 girls and 13 boys) undergoing a total of 50 craniotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A decision was made in 2001 to perform superselective angiography postoperatively in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Superselective angiography was identified to have been performed postoperatively in 12 patients and 18 treated hemispheres, and it demonstrated that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> contributed more significantly than the STA in 11 (61%) of the 18 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients were Asian, 3 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> Type 1, 1 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, and 2 had no apparent risk factors (1 patient was Asian and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> Type 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> had occurred in 58% of patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in 50% prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the first 30 days of surgery, there were 2 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (11.7% per surgically treated hemisphere and 18.2% per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of hemispheres surgically treated exhibited excellent revascularization (Matsushima Grade A) on follow-up angiography, and there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> documented in any patients more than 1 month after surgery, in a long-term follow-up of mean 4.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The contributions of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> to revascularization after pial synangiosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> are significant and may frequently exceed the contribution of the STA when surgery is performed with preservation of dural vasculature and dural inversion </plain></SENT>
