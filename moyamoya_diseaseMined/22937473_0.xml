<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We sought to review the current literature with regards to future risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> following cerebral revascularization in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review using PubMed to inspect the available data on the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after revascularization in MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In this review, we identify the risk factors associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in MMD both before and after cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included proposed pathophysiology of the hemorrhagic risk, role of the type of bypass performed, treatment options, and future needs for investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The published cases and series of MMD treatment do show a risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after treatment with either direct or indirect bypass both in the immediate as well as long-term future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While there are no discernible patterns in the rate of these <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, there is Class III evidence for the predictive effect of multiple microbleeds on preoperative imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, whereas revascularization, both direct and indirect, has been shown to reduce ischemic complications from MMD, there is not an association with the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies need to be performed to help evaluate what the risk factors are and how to counsel patients as to the long-term outlook of this disease process </plain></SENT>
