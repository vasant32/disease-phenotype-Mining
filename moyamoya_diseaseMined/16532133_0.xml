<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> were identified from within a cohort of 104 Saudi children who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were seen as inpatients in the Pediatric Wards or evaluated at the Outpatient Clinics of the Division of Pediatric Neurology (DPN), and the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive form for clinical, neuroimaging, neurophysiological and laboratory data retrieval was designed and completed for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac evaluation included 12-lead ECG and serial echocardiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cardiac catheterization and 24-hour ambulatory ECG (Holter) were conducted on clinical discretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac diseases</z:e> were the underlying risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 6 (5.8%) of the 104 children (aged one month to 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients (4 males and 2 females) were evaluated at the DPN at a mean age of 5.3 years (range = 1-8 years; median 6.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was at a mean age of 34 months (range = 4 months-8 years; median = 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (CHD), whereas the sixth had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The identified CHD consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>membranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> in a 5-year-old boy who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> and sickle cell beta(0)-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001643'>patent ductus arteriosus</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) in a 17-month-old girl, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006695'>atrioventricular canal defect</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> in an 8-year-old boy who also had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e>, partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage in a one-year-old boy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001636'>Tetralogy of Fallot</z:hpo> in an 8-year-old boy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latter patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> secondary to a septic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath>, which evolved into brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> involving the right fronto-parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was successfully managed surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The sixth patient was an 8 1/2-year-old girl who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and complex partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001723'>restrictive cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Serial echocardiograms depicted resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> within 5 years and subsequent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiac diseases</z:e>, as a group, constitute a significant risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Saudi children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of these diseases is important to prevent further recurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and because some of them are potentially curable </plain></SENT>
