<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical records of 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent 26 extracranial-intracranial bypass operations were reviewed with special reference to perisurgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient developed multiple postoperative ischemic infarctions and died of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The history of this patient with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> is analyzed, and the role of metabolic changes induced by H(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-PET with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven (77.8%) of nine patients operated on within 48 hours after H(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-PET with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (group 1) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo>, whereas only three (17.6%) of 17 patients operated on &gt;48 hours (group 2) after the examination had intraoperative pH of &lt;7.35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the mean intraoperative pH was 7.328, which was significantly lower than the mean pH of 7.393 (P &lt;.0001) in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After H(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-PET with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge, patients must be carefully observed concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> and volume state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We recommend at least 48 hours between examination and surgery for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> so that their conditions can stabilize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, special care should be taken to avoid additional perioperative risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011106'>hypovolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
