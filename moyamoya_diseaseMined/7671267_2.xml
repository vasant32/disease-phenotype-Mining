<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the importance of computed tomography (CT) and conventional magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in diagnosing MMD has already been determined, conventional arteriography is still regarded as necessary for definitive diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-A) is a very recent vascular imaging technique which allows noninvasive and direct imaging of vessels without the use of contrast medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present four pediatric cases of MMD, evaluated by conventional angiography, CT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-A is successful both in allowing detection of occlusive disease of the basal portion of the internal carotid artery and large branch basal cerebral vessels and demonstrating the collateral vessels at the base of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a noninvasive procedure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-A promises to become a valuable alternative to classical angiography in the diagnosis of MMD </plain></SENT>
