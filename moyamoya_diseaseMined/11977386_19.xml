<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between September 1991 and August 1997, 27 patients (13 female, 14 male) underwent fractionated proton radiation therapy for progressive or recurrent low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at time of treatment ranged from 2 to 18 years (mean: 8.7 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were located centrally (diencephalic) in 15 patients, in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres in seven patients, and in the brainstem in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>25/27 patients (92%) were treated for progressive, unresectable, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> following subtotal resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tissue diagnosis was available in 23/27 patients (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients with optic pathway <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were treated without histologic confirmation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Target doses between 50.4 and 63.0 CGE (<z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">Cobalt</z:chebi> Gray Equivalent, mean: 55.2 CGE) were prescribed at 1.8 CGE per fraction, five treatments per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (0.6-6.8 years), 6/27 patients experienced local failure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> located within the irradiated field), and 4/27 patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By anatomic site these data translated into rates of local control and survival of 87% (13/15 patients) and 93% (14/15 patients) for central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, 71% (5/7 patients) and 86% (6/7 patients) for hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, and 60% (3/5 patients) and 60% (3/5 patients) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> located in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proton radiation therapy was generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children with local control maintained their performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One child with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo>, Type 1, developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients with optic pathway <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and useful vision maintained or improved their visual status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report on pediatric low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytomas</z:hpo> confirms proton radiation therapy as a safe and efficacious 3-D conformal treatment modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Results are encouraging for central <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> as well as large optic pathway <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, where dose conformity is of particular importance; yet it is difficult to achieve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Longer follow-up time is needed to fully evaluate the benefits of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue sparing </plain></SENT>
