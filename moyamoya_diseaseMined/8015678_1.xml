<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of nontraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> caused by the rupture of transdural anastomotic vessels in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 55-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was made on the basis of CT and angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No lesions suggestive of trauma, such as cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp>, could be detected during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although total evacuation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was performed, she developed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854369" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">apallic syndrome</z:e> and did not recover consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Judging from the angiographic and operative findings, it appears that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred first and stretched the transdural anastomotic vessels which supplied the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This led to tearing of some of the vessels, and their proximal ends were consequently exposed in the subdural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The surgical treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> requires the closest attention to avoid damage to the collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although we carefully arrested the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> without using a coagulator in order to spare the collateral vessels, the transdural anastomosis was no longer visible on postoperative angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> irrigation with trephination therapy, which may minimize the damage to the collateral circulation, may be the most appropriate treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cerebral revascularization should be performed for the treatment of the circulatory disturbance intercepted by the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> itself or by operative manipulation </plain></SENT>
