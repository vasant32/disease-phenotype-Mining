<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of intraoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiography (ICGA) in the bypass surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven MMD patients were surgically treated and prospectively recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative ICGA was performed with a surgical microscope with integrated ICGA technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ICGA was performed 60 times in 37 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient, upon the completion of anastomosis, a near-infrared light emitted by laser diodes was used to illuminate the operating field and the intravascular fluorescence recorded by an optical filter-equipped video camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assessment of vascular patency and occlusion were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of ICGA were compared with those of postoperative DSA (digital subtraction angiography) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, excellent visualization of cerebral arteries was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The information provided by intraoperative ICGA significantly changed the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ICGA was used to identify 2 nonfunctioning STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery) bypasses and both could be revised successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the final findings of ICGA could be positively validated by DSA during the postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As one kind of intraoperative angiography, ICGA provides a reliable and rapid intraoperative assessment of bypass patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ICGA has a high spatial resolution and it facilitates the identification of stenoses and obstruction at the anastomotic site or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstructions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is a helpful tool for the intraoperative evaluation of bypass patency </plain></SENT>
