<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the angiograms of 66 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> to investigate whether stenotic lesions are present in the external carotid artery and its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We noticed that 13 patients had stenoses in the branches of the external carotid artery, although no occlusions were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the arterial stenoses and/or occlusions are not confined to the intracranial arteries and that systemic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result also suggests that studies on specimens of the superficial temporal artery, which can be obtained easily at surgery, may reveal the molecular mechanism of intimal thickening </plain></SENT>
