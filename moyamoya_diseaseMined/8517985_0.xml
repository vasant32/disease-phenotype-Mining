<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a girl of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> due to atlanto-axial instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the age of 3 years, she presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscle weakness</z:hpo> of gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and could not walk without support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, at the age of 6, she presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002313'>spastic paraparesis</z:hpo> with predominance on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To explain her neurological manifestations, we performed cranial MRI first, and found multiple infarctions with predominance on the right hemisphere, the occlusive changes of internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries, and signal void flow signs in basal ganglia, which suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was confirmed by cranial angiography, discrepancy between clinical manifestations (right-side dominant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>) and MRI findings (right-side dominant infarctions) could not be explained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, we performed cervical MRI, which showed severely compressed lesions with predominance on the right side, corresponding to her clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is essential to perform not only cranial but also cervical MRI for a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> presenting neurological complications </plain></SENT>
