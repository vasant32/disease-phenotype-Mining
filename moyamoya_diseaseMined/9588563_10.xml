<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the development of spontaneous leptomeningeal collateral channels between the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and other major arteries is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients require revascularization not only to the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) but also to that of the ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For reliable revascularization to the ACA territory, we performed superficial temporal artery (STA)-ACA direct anastomosis in 5 of 58 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent cerebral revascularization at our institute during the last 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Because two patients presented with ischemic symptoms corresponding to the ACA territory after the ipsilateral STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, we subsequently performed STA-ACA anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three patients in whom hypoperfusion in the ACA territory was suspected based on preoperative angiograms and/or stimulated cerebral blood flow studies, we performed STA-ACA and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses during a single operative procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After paramedian frontal craniotomy (diameter, approximately 5 cm), STA-ACA anastomosis was performed at the convexity, using a cortical branch of the ACA as a recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interposed STA graft was used in four patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the grafts were shorter than 4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bypass flow was satisfactory in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient who underwent simultaneous STA-ACA and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses had poor bypass flow, probably caused by spontaneous leptomeningeal collateral channels between the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient had an ischemic attack after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our method using a cortical branch of the ACA as a recipient and a branch of the STA for the interposed graft can be performed at the convexity and much more easily than in a deep operative field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our experience with STA-ACA anastomosis indicates that this procedure is effective for revascularization of the ACA territory in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
