<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Method: Case report and review of the world literature regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results: The reported patient had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> that initially presented as sudden, unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed occlusion of the anterior cerebral, middle cerebral and distal internal carotid arteries bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible mechanism of this patient's sudden <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> may have been <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> resulting from thrombotic narrowing or blockage by plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: The described patient represents the first reported case of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> occurring as the first symptom of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The possibility of a vascular lesion such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be considered in patients with sudden <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, especially children, young adults and Asian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Due to this disease's poor outcome, early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
