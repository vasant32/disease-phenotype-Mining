<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The progression of his disease was followed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The series of images showed progressive stenosis of both carotid arteries at the suprasellar origin with involvement of his anterior and middle cerebral arteries, while prominent collateral vessels developed from his external carotid supply through ophthalmic and middle meningeal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of cerebrovascular disease is consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that further studies on the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease in patients with HIV could be helpful in understanding the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, with the various advances in treatment of HIV, neurovascular complications could be seen more frequently as the long-term survival in these patients improves </plain></SENT>
