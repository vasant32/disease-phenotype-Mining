<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some of these options have been abandoned, others have served as the basis for the development of better procedures, and many are still in use today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Investigators studying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> during this period have concluded that the best treatment is planned after studying each patient's presenting symptoms and angiographic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedures proposed for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> can be classified into three categories: direct arterial bypasses, indirect arterial bypasses, and other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct bypass methods that have been proposed are vein grafts and extracranial-intracranial anastomosis (superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery [STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>] anastomosis and occipital artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indirect techniques that have been proposed are the following: 1) encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis; 2) encephalomyosynangiosis; 3) encephalomyoarteriosynangiosis; 4) multiple cranial bur holes; and 5) transplantation of omentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other options such as cervical carotid sympathectomy and superior cervical ganglionectomy have also been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this paper the authors describe the history of the development of surgical techniques for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
