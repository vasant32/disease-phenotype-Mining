<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The clinical presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) typically includes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its rarity, the benefit of surgery in the hemorrhagic type of pediatric MMD has not been clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to delineate the clinical features and surgical outcome of hemorrhagic MMD in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirteen patients (six boys and seven girls with a combined mean age of 11.1 years and a range of 4-18 years) were retrospectively confirmed as having MMD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> between 1988 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients underwent indirect bypass surgery that followed a relatively uniform scheme at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed their clinical features and surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time of follow-up was 50.3 months (with a range of 3-99 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six of the patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>), and six others presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH); the remaining patient presented with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and IVH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative angiography demonstrated that the patients were in various stages of the disease, but the majority of the patients (i.e., 16 of the 26 hemispheres) were in stage 3 with abundant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels (MMV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of four patients who presented with a history of prior <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> exhibited a poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients with good revascularization had a decreased degree of MMV in their follow-up angiogram and showed good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred after surgery in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization surgery may have a role for prevention of rebleeding and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in pediatric MMD patients who present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
