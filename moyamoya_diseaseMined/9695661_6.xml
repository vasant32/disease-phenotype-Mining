<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Combined assessment of three dimensional anatomical and functional images (SPECT, PET, MRI, CT) is useful to determine the nature and extent of lesions in many parts of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physicians principally rely on their spatial sense to mentally re-orient and overlap images obtained with different imaging modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective methods that enable easy and intuitive image registration can help the physician arrive at more optimal diagnoses and better treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This review describes a simple, intuitive and robust image registration approach developed in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It differs from most other registration techniques in that it allows the user to incorporate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the available information within the images in the registration process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This method takes full advantage of the ability of knowledgeable operators to achieve image registration and fusion using an intuitive interactive visual approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It can register images accurately and quickly without the use of elaborate mathematical modeling or optimization techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method provides the operator with tools to manipulate images in three dimensions, including visual feedback techniques to assess the accuracy of registration (grids, overlays, masks, and fusion of images in different colors) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its application is not limited to brain imaging and can be applied to images from any region in the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall effect is a registration algorithm that is easy to implement and can achieve accuracy on the order of one pixel </plain></SENT>
