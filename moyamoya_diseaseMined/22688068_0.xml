<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included 348 patients treated between 1996 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio was 128 to 220 with mean age of 39 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of neurological symptoms and signs during childhood and mean Suzuki stage according to the age were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adult MMD was differentiated from other diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, by comparing the laboratory data including common markers and specific markers for such diseases between 22 adult MMD and 21 atherosclerotic disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiographic data were analyzed to detect progression in 52 unilateral adult MMD patients over a mean follow-up duration of 4.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one of 128 patients (0.8%) aged over 40 years showed childhood symptoms and signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the mean Suzuki stage between patients aged 40 years and under and over 40 years was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests differentiating the other diseases with the same phenotype with MMD revealed no difference between adult MMD and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The progression of unilateral MMD to bilateral MMD occurred in 6 of 52 patients (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adult MMD is not a syndrome, but a distinct disease entity with significant progression of unilateral MMD to bilateral MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be different from pediatric cases when considering adult MMD </plain></SENT>
