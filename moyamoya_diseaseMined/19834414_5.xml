<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or pseudoaneurysms on the collateral vessels in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been known to be difficult to treat surgically because of their deep location and combined ischemic condition of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For several years, we have treated these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> by endovascular means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe the detailed techniques and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who presented with intracerebral or <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> were treated by endovascular embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had small aneurysmal lesions on distal collateral arteries (the distal part of the anterior and lateral posterior choroidal artery as periventricular collaterals in 7 patients and a small collateral branch from anterior communicating artery in 1 patient) that were located at corresponding area to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> demonstrated on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After superselecting the arteries as distally as possible, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were occluded by n-butyl-cyanoacrylate injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully and completely occluded without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One failed due to a small artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither additional neurological deficit nor newly developed infarction was observed during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinically, 6 of the 8 patients demonstrated complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No further <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred during the follow-up period (mean, 24 months; range, 11-60 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although further investigation is required to determine many aspects of this treatment, including indication, safety, and efficacy, the endovascular occlusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> on the collateral vessels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with glue could be an effective treatment option </plain></SENT>
