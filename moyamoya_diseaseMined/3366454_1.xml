<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two autopsy cases of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were investigated by histometric and histopathologic techniques and the findings compared with those in three normotensive and five hypertensive controls in order to clarify the hemodynamic characteristics of the vertebrobasilar system in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A thorough histologic examination of the vertebral and basilar arteries revealed that the fundamental arterial structures were well preserved in the vertebrobasilar system, unlike in the internal carotid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A histometric study disclosed that the mean thickness of the media was considerably greater than that in comparable arteries of normotensive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these observations, it was suggested that the essential arterial alterations in the vertebrobasilar system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were hypertensive in nature and that this might be due to the increased pressure load on this system to compensate for the occlusive state of the internal carotid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in the vertebrobasilar system, even after massive medial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> in the carotid system, was impressive and suggestive of the complexity of hemodynamic changes and consequent tissue responses in this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
