<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity were characterized by increased microvascular surface area (MVSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, MVSA correlated positively with arterial microvascular transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients were characterized by increased arterial microvascular transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that patients with a higher arteriogenic potential to alter cortical microvasculature are characterized by a more favorable hemodynamic situation and reduced clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
