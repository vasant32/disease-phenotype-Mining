<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Angiographic examinations were performed on 62 consecutive adults with spontaneous putaminal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> without remarkable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most patients were evaluated using conventional catheter angiography except for hypertensive patients over the age of 60 who underwent a magnetic resonance angiogram or a computed tomography angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and clinical factors such as age and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were correlated with the angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine of the 62 patients (15%) exhibited angiographic abnormalities, including middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (n = 3), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (n = 2), and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> associated with a proximal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angiographic yield was significantly higher (1) among patients at or below the median age of 55 compared with those above (9/33, 27%, versus 0/29, 0%; p &lt; 0.01), and (2) among patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> compared with those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (5/9, 56%, versus 4/53, 8%; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although our data could be biased due to the patient selection procedure, they suggest that angiographic evaluation is highly useful for spontaneous putaminal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> regardless of volume and shape of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, excepting hypertensive patients over 55 years of age </plain></SENT>
