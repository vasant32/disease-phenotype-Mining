<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MMD sera (n=32) were tested for anti-endothelial cell antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassays and flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that a high proportion of MMD sera had anti-endothelial cell antibodies with apoptotic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prominent reactivities of MMD sera (72%) with recombinant human alpha-fodrin were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that MMD sera contain a high incidence of anti-alpha-fodrin autoantibodies, providing new insight into the mechanisms of occlusion of MMD arteries </plain></SENT>
