<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several authors have reported temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> after revascularization surgery in some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the incidence and mechanisms of PONDs in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postoperative neurological deficits were retrospectively evaluated 1 month or less postoperatively on 32 hemispheric sides of 17 symptomatic adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> treated surgically with direct and/or indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Various PONDs were observed in 9 sides (28%) from 7 patients 1 month or less after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were recognized in 7 (39%) of 18 sides with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and 2 (14%) of 14 sides with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurological deficits were usually observed 1 week or less after surgery, and resolved within 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurological deficits were divided into 3 groups based on duration of symptoms: single transient neurologic deficits in 3 sides; repeated transient neurologic deficits in 3 sides; and continuous neurologic deficits in 3 sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiologic examinations demonstrated no ischemic changes in any patients, and subsequent focal hyperemia after surgery on 3 sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurological deficits occurred more frequently in younger patients or those with poor vascular response before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative neurological deficits frequently occur in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but are temporary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These deficits appear to result from focal hyperperfusion after surgery, rather than from ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
