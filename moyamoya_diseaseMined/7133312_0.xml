<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 45-year-old female had sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> without any inducing moments and was transferred to our hospital by an ambulance car </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission the patient was alert and showed only signs of meningeal irritation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no other neurological deficits at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediate CT examination revealed a small high density spot in the area of the right basal ganglia, and a large high density in the frontal horns of both lateral ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiogram showed completely patent carotid siphon with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A small round aneurysmal shadow of 3 mm in diameter was seen in the area of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels of the right basal ganglia, and it was thought to be corresponding to the high density spot in the CT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram showed stenosis of C portion with typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, diagnosis of atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and ventricular penetration of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was placed on conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On 25th day from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, repeated angiogram showed enlargement of the aneurysmal shadow from 3 mm to 5 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>So, on 33rd day, right STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and encephalomyosynangiosis were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiogram on 12th day after surgery revealed no aneurysmal shadow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged without any neurological deficit at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Previous paper, which reported cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>According to the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, these cases were classified into 3 types angiographically; type I: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels, type II: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of cerebral-peripheral artery, and type III: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It has been generally believed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> may be associated with either a true or a pseudoaneurysm in the case of type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, pseudoaneurysm in the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels has not been found in postmortem examination but true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore it may not be denied that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of this case was true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> although it showed an enlarging tendency and disappeared rather spontaneously </plain></SENT>
