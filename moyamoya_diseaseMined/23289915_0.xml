<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a limited number of reports in the literature that have linked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe their experience in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> developed as part of the clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods The authors conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive series of 316 children who underwent pial synangiosis revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> at the Boston Children's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results Of 316 surgically treated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 10 (3.2%; 6 boys and 4 girls) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> as a part of their presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age at surgical treatment was 9.9 years (range 3.8-17.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had evidence of hypertrophied lenticulostriate collateral vessels through the basal ganglia on preoperative angiography and/or MRI on affected sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0006799'>cystic lesions in the basal ganglia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent bilateral craniotomies for pial synangiosis, and 1 patient underwent a single craniotomy for unilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available in 9 patients (average 50.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> was 1.36 years (range 2 days to 4 years), with resolution of symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> 3 years after surgical treatment, 4 patients had transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> that resolved prior to surgery, and 5 patients experienced resolution of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> after surgery (average 13 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions The authors describe children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> as part of their clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that involvement of the basal ganglia by the hypertrophied collateral vessels contributes to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo>, which can wax or wane depending on disease stage or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> of the vessels after revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In most patients, however, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002072'>chorea</z:hpo> improves or disappears about 1 year after presentation </plain></SENT>
