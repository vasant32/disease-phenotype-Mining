<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Ultrasonography is a non-invasive diagnostic technique, and it has been used to detect intracranial lesions in neonates for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, screening tests using cranial ultrasonography have been applied for early detection of intracranial lesions in full-term neonates during the past decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the findings of cranial ultrasonographic screening tests in healthy full-term neonates between September 2004 and August 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrasonographic findings were divided into the following categories: (a) nonsignificant (NS) group, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variations, (b) minor anomaly group, including tiny cystic lesions, mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or mild ventricular anomaly, and (c) major anomaly group, including significant anomaly of any intracranial pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The participants with major anomalies were further reviewed, and the following medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enrolled patients were reviewed until they were 24 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were a total of 3186 neonates who received cranial ultrasonographic screening examination during the 5-year period, and most of them (2982 cases, 93.6%) were assigned to the NS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation was the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002389'>cavum septum pellucidum</z:hpo> (1979 cases, 62.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor anomalies were found in 202 (6.3%) neonates, including 119 (3.7%) neonates with tiny <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath>, and 59 (1.9%) neonates with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Major anomalies were found in two (0.06%) neonates, including obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001274'>agenesis of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two other infants (0.06%) initially presented with minor anomaly or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> variation, but they were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> some months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The incidence of minor and major anomalies detected by cranial ultrasonographic screening examinations in healthy full-term neonates is 6.3% and 0.06%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, cranial ultrasonographic screening testing may play a role in the early diagnosis of intracranial anomalies of otherwise healthy neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this examination cannot exclude or detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cranial abnormalities, including many potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456669" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic diseases</z:e> of neonates, so continuing clinical diligence is still important for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infants </plain></SENT>
