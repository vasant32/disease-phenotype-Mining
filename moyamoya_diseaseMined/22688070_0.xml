<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in molecular biology and genetic research have provided better understanding of the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but surgical revascularization still remains the preferred treatment for this entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the clinical course of 106 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with indirect pial synangiosis in 150 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of surgery on the operated hemisphere were favorable, with no cerebrovascular event during the outpatient follow-up period (mean 58.4 months) in 89.3% (134/150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients suffered hemorrhagic events on the operated hemisphere during the follow-up period (2/150, 1.33%), one of whom suffered deteriorated neurological status after <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the favorable long-term outcome, the incidence of temporary neurological deterioration due to cerebral hyperperfusion was 18.0% (27/150), but no patients suffered permanent neurological deterioration directly caused by hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, direct/indirect revascularization surgery is a safe and effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, although the issue of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>/re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> remains to be solved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion and peri-operative infarction are potential complications of this procedure, so we recommend intensive postoperative care and cerebral blood flow measurement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, because the management of hyperperfusion is contradictory to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
