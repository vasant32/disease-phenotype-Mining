<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebral revascularization surgery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e>) is increasingly recognized as an important component in the treatment of complex cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> requires that the incidence of perioperative neurological complications should be minimized, because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> for ischemic disease is often not the goal of treatment, but rather a prophylactic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> carries the risk of focal postoperative neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little has been established concerning mechanisms of post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used 3.0-T diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to analyze the incidence and mechanism of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the anterior circulation territory after 20 CRS procedures involving 33 vascular anastomosis procedures (13 double anastomoses and 7 single anastomoses) in 12 men and 8 women between June 2007 and October 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operations included single or double superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis to treat internal carotid artery/<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions or severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combined STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and indirect bypass were performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative DWI and MRA were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients between 24 and 96h after surgery to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>, hypoperfusion, or procedural ischemic complications and vasospasms of the donor STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Follow-up DWI and MRA were carried out 1.8Â±0.6 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> (range, 1-4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Temporary occlusion time for anastomoses averaged 18.9min (range, 16-32min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic new hyperintensities occurred in the ipsilateral hemisphere of 2 patients on postoperative DWI (10% patients/6.0% anastomoses), and 1 moyamoya patient (5.0% patients/3.0% anastomoses) developed a symptomatic hyperintensity in the ipsilateral occipital lobe in response to the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two abnormal small (&lt;5mm) cortical DWI lesions were caused by sacrifices of a small branch of the recipient <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study is the first postoperative 3.0-T DWI study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> and related clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic postoperative DWI abnormalities was restricted to 1 moyamoya patient representing 5.0% of total patients and 3.0% anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although some postoperative DWI abnormalities occurred, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRS</z:e> was found to be safe with a low risk of symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
