<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Standard extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) arterial bypass surgery represents a well-recognized procedure in which the aim is to augment distal cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The creation of the bypass requires temporary occlusion of the recipient vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, there exists controversy about the risk of standard EC-IC arterial bypass surgery causing ischemic complications due to temporary vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study, the incidence of intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was investigated in symptomatic patients with steno-occlusive cerebrovascular disease and existing hemodynamic insufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients (14 women and 6 men; mean age 46 +/- 11 years) suffering from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> due to occlusive cerebrovascular disease and proven hemodynamic compromise in functional blood flow studies were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathological condition was internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion in 6 cases and ICA or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis in 3 cases, whereas 11 patients presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical procedure consisted of the establishment of a standard superficial temporal artery (STA)-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass, and was performed while a strict intraoperative management protocol was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent clinical examination and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging within 48 hours before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of reversible clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was 2 (10%) of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging revealed signs of diffusion disturbances in 2 (10%) of 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed diffusion-weighted imaging changes, however, were situated within the dependent vascular territory at risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 1 patient only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No permanent neurological deficit occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The temporary vessel occlusion time ranged between 25 and 42 minutes (mean 33 +/- 7 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> means are expressed +/- the standard deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Temporary vessel occlusion during standard STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> arterial bypass surgery carries a low risk of intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when a strict perioperative management protocol is applied </plain></SENT>
