<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new technique of indirect revascularization using the dural arterial supply to provide donor vessels is presented together with the results of an assay performed to determine the angiogenic activity of the dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At surgery, a portion of the dura near the branches of the middle meningeal artery was split into outer and inner layers, and the split surface of the outer layer was attached to the cortical surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure, combined a with standard encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, was applied to 25 hemispheres in 18 patients with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age 6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were symptom free by 1.5 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 12 years (mean 6.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (81%) of 16 patients were able to lead <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lives and three were mildly handicapped due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> that existed preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative superselective angiograms demonstrated effective cortical revascularization through the dural arteries as well as from the scalp arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A histological study of the dura in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> showed an increased number of blood vessels in the outer layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiogenic activity determined by chorioallantoic membrane assay was higher in the split surface of the dura than in the internal surface of the dura (the natural interface between the dura and cortex) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The split duroencephalosynangiosis described in this report is a useful addition to indirect revascularization techniques, allowing extension of the area of revascularization in the ischemic hemispheres of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
