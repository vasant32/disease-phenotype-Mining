<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared results of quantitative and semi-quantitative SPECT studies to determine parameters by the semi-quantitative method to define severe hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 14 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after surgical revascularization by STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass and encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS), quantitative <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT studies using the autoradiographic method (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-ARG method) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional vascular reserve (rVR) were measured in bilateral cortical territories (ROI) and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Semi-quantitative parameters were calculated from the ratio of ROI counts to the dominant cerebellar counts (ROI/Ce ratio) at resting and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-activated conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before surgery, the mean resting rCBF and rVR in bilateral ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories were less than 40 ml/100 g/min and less than 10%, respectively, indicating severe hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for the ACA territories, both the mean resting rCBF and mean rVR values in the entire cortex increased significantly after surgery (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By semi-quantitative studies, before surgery, the mean resting and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-activated ROI/Ce ratios in bilateral ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories were less than 0.90 and 0.80, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean resting and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-activated ROI/Ce ratios increased significantly in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory after surgery </plain></SENT>
