<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular diseases, six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">Iodine</z:chebi>-123-IMZ SPECT images were obtained for 15 min, 3 hr after the administration of 167 or 222 MBq 123I-IMZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, the CBF and oxygen metabolism were measured by the 50 steady-state method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, the CBF and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism were measured by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>-fluoro-2-deoxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi>-PET, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain was initially classified into 18 regions, and abnormalities in the BZD receptor distribution, CBF and cerebral metabolism were visually evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The count ratio of lesion-to-contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> region (L-to-C ratio) was then used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the core of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, the 123I-IMZ uptake decreased (L-to-C ratios of the blood flow 0.42 +/- 0.26; metabolism 0.45 +/- 0.24; and 123I-IMZ uptake 0.46 +/- 0.14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> region, the 123I-IMZ uptake slightly decreased (L-to-C ratios of 0.81, 0.82 and 0.89, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the region of misery perfusion, the 123I-IMZ uptake was preserved (L-to-C ratios of 0.73, 1.07 and 1.02, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the remote deafferentiated areas in the ipsilateral cerebrum, the 123I-IMZ uptake was preserved (L-to-C ratios of 0.76 +/- 0.10, 0.75 +/- 0.04 and 0.98 +/- 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the remote areas in the contralateral cerebellum, the 123I-IMZ uptake was preserved (L-to-C ratios of 0.84 +/- 0.08, 0.85 +/- 0.04 and 0.94 +/- 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The BZD receptor distribution, as measured by 123I-IMZ SPECT, is not considered to reflect neuronal function, but it may reflect neuronal cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">Iodine</z:chebi>-123-IMZ SPECT may, therefore, hold promise as a potential probe for neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
