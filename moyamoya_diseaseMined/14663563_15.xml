<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND PATIENT SELECTION: Twenty three patients were diagnosed and treated from 1997-2001 in our neurosurgical department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative angiography, colour Doppler examination, cranial MRI and/or CT scans, HMPAO-SPECT or H(2)(15)O PET (baseline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> challenge) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients presented with child-juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> with an average age at presentation of 8 years (range 1-17 years), in 4 patients adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> was diagnosed with a mean age at presentation of 34 years (range 23-40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient bilateral affection was present at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent direct and/or additional indirect revascularisation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients underwent bilateral revascularisation procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients a unilateral procedure was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A direct STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass (superficial temporal artery branch - middle cerebral artery branch anastomosis) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional direct STA-ACA bypass (STA - anterior cerebral artery branch anastomosis) was performed in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Indirect arteriosynangiosis using the occipital artery was performed in the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) territory in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The frontal branch of the STA was used for arteriosynangiosis in the frontal region in another 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Indirect frontal durasynangiosis was performed in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number and location of multiple revascularisation procedures was determined according to the angiographic findings as well as the site of decreased perfusion reserves seen on H(2)(15)O PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A one stage revascularisation procedure was performed in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients underwent two stage procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Following operation no complications were encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one adult patient who died postoperatively due to a massive middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the nonoperated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As territorial hemodynamic disorder seems to be a characteristic in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and/or syndrome, judging from our experience with European patients in our series, and several reports hitherto, treatment with multiple revascularisation procedures is considered to be justified </plain></SENT>
