<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who were scheduled to undergo revascularization surgery and 100 healthy volunteers were examined using T2-reversed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging performed using a 3-tesla system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 18 patients underwent a second study between 1 year and 3 years after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance images obtained in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were statistically analyzed and compared with those obtained in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings were also correlated with results of single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography and conventional cerebral angiography studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transverse lines in the white matter (medullary streaks) were observed in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers, the diameter sizes of the medullary streaks increased significantly with age (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age-adjusted medullary streak diameters were significantly larger in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diameter sizes also increased significantly with the increased severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) and a higher angiographically determined stage of the disease (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diameter sizes decreased significantly after surgery (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The increases in medullary streak diameters observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> appear to represent vessels dilated due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>High-field T2-reversed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is useful in estimating cerebral circulation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
