<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six out of the 17 patients had bypass surgery twice, so twenty-three cases in total were included in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative parameters were measured 7 days after each operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average of intraoperative blood loss was 103 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Decreases in TP, TCH, HGB, RBC, and HCT were 19.7%, 21.3%, 19.8%, 20.8%, and 20.2%, respectively (paired t-test, P &lt; 0.000001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age had a significantly negative correlation with blood loss rate (blood loss/total blood volume), decrease in HGB, decrease in RBC, and decrease in HCT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight also had a significantly negative correlation with these values, respectively </plain></SENT>
