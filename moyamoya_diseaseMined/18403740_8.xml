<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was the aim of our study to characterize the anatomic pattern and microhemodynamics of cortical microvascularization in MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Intraoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> videoangiography was performed in 16 adult MMD patients, 15 patients with atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease (ACVD), and 10 control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cortical microvascularization and microvascular hemodynamics were categorized and analyzed according to anatomic and functional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> angiographic aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anatomic analysis included microvascular density, microvascular diameter, and microvascular surface per analyzed area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microhemodynamic analysis included microvascular transit time, arterial microvascular transit time, and venous microvascular transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microvascular density and diameter were significantly increased in MMD patients (1.8+/-0.2 mm/mm(2) and 0.24+/-0.03 mm, respectively) compared with those in ACVD patients (1.5+/-0.2 mm/mm(2) and 0.20+/-0.02 mm, respectively) and controls (1.5+/-0.1 mm/mm(2) and 0.19+/-0.03 mm, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This resulted in significantly increased microvascular surface per analyzed area in MMD (67+/-13%) vs ACVD patients (47+/-7%) and controls (45+/-6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Anatomic changes were paralleled by significantly increased microvascular and arterial microvascular transit times in MMD patients (11.55+/-3.50 and 6.79+/-2.96 seconds, respectively) compared with those in ACVD patients (8.13+/-1.78 and 4.34+/-1.30 seconds, respectively) and controls (8.04+/-2.16 and 4.50+/-1.87 seconds, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cortical microvascularization in MMD is characterized by significantly increased microvascular density and microvascular diameter, leading to increased microvascular surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These anatomic alterations are accompanied by prolonged microvascular hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These observations might represent an MMD-specific compensation mechanism for impaired cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
