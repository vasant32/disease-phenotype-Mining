<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So we have classified the angiographical findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> into six stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there have been no report that proved these findings in long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, these angiographical findings are mainly observed in children, we can seldom to find out any changes in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed long-term follow up angiography in adult cases whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was in childhood to clarify the natural course of this disease and to understand the difference between the cases of children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases (4 males and 7 females) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were investigated by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 5.1 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were diagnosed by initial angiography in childhood (average age were 6.5 years old) and they grew up into adolescence (average age were 18.6 years old) at the time of follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial symptoms of them were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ischemic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> 7, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> 2 or completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The symptoms at the time of follow-up were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> in 5 patients, slight neurological deficits in 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 2 and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among them, one patient had suffered from <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: the progression of angiographical stages was observed in 95% of sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 71% of sides, angiographical stage was in 5 or 6 which is thought to be an end stage of this disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
