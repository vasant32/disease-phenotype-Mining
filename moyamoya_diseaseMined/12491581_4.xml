<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at clarifying the clinical significance of posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) stenosis/occlusion in pediatric and adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 132 patients (52 children and 80 adults) who were diagnosed as by cerebral angiography having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT or MRI was performed to examine the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and vasoreactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were measured in 80 patients before surgery, using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (3D-MRA) was repeated in 32 pediatric patients after surgery in order to clarify the natural course of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis/occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 264 sides in 132 patients, <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis/occlusion was observed in 50 sides of 40 patients (30.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its incidence was significantly higher in ischemic-type patients than in hemorrhagic-type and asymptomatic patients, and was higher in patients in the advanced stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hemisphere ipsilateral to <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis/occlusion had higher incidence of ischemic symptoms, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and impaired cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (hemianopsia) or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the occipital lobe was noted in 4 (10%) of 40 patients during follow-up periods after bypass surgery for anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 32 pediatric patients, none showed progression of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis on 3D-MRA during follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the involvement of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> could increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in both anterior and posterior circulation areas, suggesting that the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> plays an important collateral role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
