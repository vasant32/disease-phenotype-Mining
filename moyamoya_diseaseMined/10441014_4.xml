<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After evaluating two methods for compensating relaxation times, we selected a long TR, short TE sequence to achieve better reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow (CBF) value was measured by scintigraphy following the method of quantification reported in the previous literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) concentrations and CBFs value were decreased statistically (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>05) compared with those of the age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the decreased rate of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> concentration was changed more than the CBF value, and no linear correlation was found between the two values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We considered that the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> concentration was not always correlated with that of the present cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> concentration showed a more dispersive distribution in patients than in controls, indicating a large individual variation in neuronal impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We concluded that proton MRS may provide useful information about neuronal impairment in individual patients </plain></SENT>
