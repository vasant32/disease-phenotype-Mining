<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetic background of patients with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, because of the dominant prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the mongoloid population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nucleotide sequences of the noncoding D-loop region of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA, corresponding to positions 93-110 and 326-307 of the Cambridge Reference Sequence, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The significance of differences of the average pairwise divergence between the patient and control groups was tested using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography has increased the incidental detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the general population by 100 times, and more than half of cases are familial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study, 43 probands of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and 46 healthy controls without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average pairwise divergence was 0.63% in the familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> population, and 1.2% in the control population, showing a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> population has a specific genetic background different from the general Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients in Japan have a genetically close association, indicating the possibility of screening for the specific genetic background of familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
