<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the present epidemiological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> based on recently obtained regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-inclusive data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-inclusive survey of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in Hokkaido, one of the major islands in Japan that has a population of 5.63 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The epidemiological features were analysed based on the data from 267 newly registered patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in Hokkaido from 2002 to 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These analysed data were adjusted to the whole Japanese population at 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The detection rate of the disease per year was 0.94 patients per 100,000 people, and prevalence was 10.5 patients per 100,000 people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> concerned with the disease was 0.53 patients per 100,000 people-years and haemorrhage was 0.2 patients per 100,000 people-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of female to male patients was 2.18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ratio of patients aged 10 years and above to under 10 years of age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 6.18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two peaks for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> were seen: the highest was observed between 45 and 49 years, and the second between 5 and 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients comprised 17.8% of the total number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The epidemiological features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> determined by this survey varied considerably from previous data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The detection rate and prevalence of the disease were higher than those reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The highest peak of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age was older than those reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was revealed that asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients are not always rare in Japan </plain></SENT>
