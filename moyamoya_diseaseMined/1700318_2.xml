<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the efficacy of vascular reconstructive surgery for childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 31 hemispheres of 16 patients was examined by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) using the 133Xe inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results were divided into two groups; 17 hemispheres with superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis [A(+) group] and 14 hemispheres without anastomosis [A(-) group] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean hemispheric CBF (mCBF) and regional CBF (rCBF) in the frontal, temporal, occipital, and basal ganglia regions were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative SPECT on the 10 hemispheres of the A(+) group showed an increase in mCBF in 6 hemispheres, the disappearance of the low perfusion area (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 hemispheres where <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> was present before surgery, and an improvement in rCBF distribution (an increase in rCBF in the frontal and temporal lobes and a decrease in the basal ganglia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that vascular reconstruction is greatly effective in treating this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A comparison between the A(+) group and the A(-) group by postoperative SPECT, as well as the clinical outcomes and the postoperative findings of electroencephalography and angiography, revealed that the A(+) group was superior to the A(-) group in the frequency of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="52288">LPA</z:chebi> (12% and 43%, respectively) and rCBF in the frontal region where STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was usually performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with indirect synangiosis is the most effective treatment of childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
