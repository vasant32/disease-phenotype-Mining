<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a technique proposed by Ichihara and Ogawa (triple-energy window method) as a gold standard, effects of correcting the scatter has been evaluated for 5 different phantom configurations, as well as a clinical cerebral blood flow study with use of 123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Without the scatter correction but with a correction for attenuation, a conventional reconstruction provided a non-uniform distribution for uniform phantom configurations, and the quantitative pixel counts being highly dependent on size and shape of the objects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a uniform distribution and quantitative pixel counts that were independent of size or shape of the object were obtained by applying the scatter correction using a conventional attenuation correction technique with use of a theoretical mu value of 0.146 cm-1, thus suggesting importance of the scatter correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed without the scatter correction, if an empirical value of mu of 0.07 cm-1 was used in the attenuation correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this procedure was found to decrease the image contrast between the high count and low count regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant underestimation of 20-30% was caused in cortical gray matter regions, and overestimation of 20% in the white matter regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In practical clinical studies, magnitude of the error is still unknown, and is probably dependent on shape, size and radioactivity distribution of the object </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A further systematic study is required in order to investigate significance of the scatter correction in real clinical studies </plain></SENT>
