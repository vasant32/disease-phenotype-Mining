<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The usual and novel associations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> in this cohort will also be described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology at King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the periods July 1992 to February 2001 (retrospective study) and February 2001 to March 2003 (prospective study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Investigations for suspected cases included hemostatic assays, biochemical, and serological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging included CT, MRI, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> computerized tomography (SPECT) brain scan and conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya syndrome</z:e> was the underlying risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 6 (5.8%) of the 104 children (aged one month to 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were 4 females and 2 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their first cerebral ischemic event occurred at a mean age of 45 months (median = 44 months, range 17-66 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 cases, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> was associated with an underlying hematologic abnormality or other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>Protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was identified in one girl and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242666" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">protein S deficiency</z:e> in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had respectively, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857812" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell-beta-thalassemia</z:e> (S <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e>), which had been associated in the latter with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011682'>membranous ventricular septal defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="AOS">Adams-Oliver syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e>, OMIM 100300) was associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> in an 18-month-old girl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A 4-year-old boy had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406587" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">wrinkly skin syndrome</z:e> (WSS, OMIM 278250) phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo> was first reported in this cohort of patients, whereas the association of the syndrome with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">WWS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> has not, hitherto, been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients who had <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005543'>protein C deficiency</z:hpo>, SCD, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AOS</z:e> underwent successful revascularization surgery in the form of encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya syndrome</z:e> constitutes an important risk factor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Saudi children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive clinical evaluation and investigations, including screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>thrombophilia</z:hpo> and neuroimaging studies, are required for the primary diagnosis of the disease and for unraveling other diseases associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
