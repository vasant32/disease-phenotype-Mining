<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is a progressive cerebrovascular occlusive disease that is rare in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages but frequently presents in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the disease is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined elastin gene transcripts and elastin synthesis in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients and compared them with those in SMCs from age-matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used six cell strains from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients and four from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of elastin protein was observed by Western blot analysis and metabolic labeling with 3H-valine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elastin gene transcripts were identified by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elastin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SMCs from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients compared with control SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent enhancer of the expression of elastin in arterial SMCs, upregulated elastin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in SMCs from both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients and control subjects, the maximum levels of elastin synthesis and elastin gene transcripts in response to exogenous TGF-beta 1 were significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs than control SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, quiescent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs secreted significantly more TGF-beta 1 into the culture medium than quiescent control SMCs (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may result, at least in part, from an abnormal regulation of extracellular matrix metabolism that leads to increased steady state levels of elastin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and elastin accumulation in the intimal thickening and that increased elastin accumulation is a stable marker of SMCs from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
