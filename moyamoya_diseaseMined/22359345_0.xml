<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in ten <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> patients using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography (xeCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which included multiple pseudo-continuous ASL (pcASL) with different postlabel delays, VSASL, and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation coefficient, root-mean-square difference, mean CBF error between ASL, and gold-standard xeCT CBF measurements as well the dependence of this error on transit delay (TD) as estimated by DSC time-to-peak of the residue function (Tmax) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For pcASL with different postlabel delay time (PLD), CBF measurement with short PLD (1.5-2 sec) had the strongest correlations with xeCT; VSASL had a lower but still significant correlation with a mean coefficient of 0.55 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We noted the theoretically predicted dependence of CBF error on Tmax and on PLD for pcASL; VSASL CBF measurements had the least dependence of the error on TD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also noted effects suggesting that the location of the label decay (blood vs. tissue) impacted the measurement, which was worse for pcASL than for VSASL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that VSASL is less sensitive to TD than conventional ASL techniques and holds promise for CBF measurements in cerebrovascular diseases with slow flow </plain></SENT>
