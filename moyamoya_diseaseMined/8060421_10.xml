<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Untreated, the disease is often clinically progressive, resulting in significant neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS), which involves the transposition of a segment of a scalp artery onto the surface of the brain, is a surgical treatment aimed at improving collateral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six children underwent 8 EDAS procedures and were followed from 6 months to 9 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
