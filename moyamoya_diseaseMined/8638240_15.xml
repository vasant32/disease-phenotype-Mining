<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that excellent development of collateral circulation can be achieved through indirect nonanastomotic bypass procedures for pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are no definitive conclusions about the effect of indirect revascularization for adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the value of indirect bypass surgery for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we have analyzed their follow-up angiographic results in comparison with those of the pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1989 and 1993, 23 patients underwent combined direct and indirect bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They consisted of 16 adults (mean age, 35; range, 20-59) and seven children (mean age, 10; range, 3-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main symptoms were those due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 of 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative cerebral blood flow studies showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients to have decreased vascular reserve (misery perfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative follow-up angiography was done in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at a median of 6 months after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> pediatric patients showed good or moderate development of collaterals through the indirect bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the adult group, seven patients aged 20 to 29 had angiographic results similar to those of the pediatric group  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, nine patients older than 30 had results contrary to those of pediatric patients: (1) the degree of indirect revascularization declined to moderate or poor grades (especially in patients older than 40) and (2) the degree of direct bypass filling improved to high or medium grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that advancing age apparently affects the development of collateral formation through the indirect bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Consequently, direct bypass is thought to be the main treatment option for patients older than 40 </plain></SENT>
