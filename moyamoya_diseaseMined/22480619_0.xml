<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Duplex ultrasonography examinations of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were performed preoperatively, postoperatively (within 30 days) and as follow-up exams (6 months postoperatively) after 32 cerebral revascularization procedures in 20 European patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant higher mean diastolic flow of STA compared to preoperative values was found in postoperative (p&lt;.000) and follow-up exams (p&lt;.001) in Duplex ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative and follow-up Duplex sonography of STA also showed a significantly higher mean systolic flow compared to preoperative values (p&lt;.05 and p&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Also ECA showed significantly changes after bypass surgery (p&lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Duplex ultrasonography of STA is a reliable and non-invasive tool to investigate hemodynamic changes after bypass surgery and to detect bypass patency in European patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
