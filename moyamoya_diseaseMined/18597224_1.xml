<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Various types of revascularization surgery have been performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and there have been controversies about the surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we introduce our surgical strategy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and discuss the various surgical procedure options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects consisted of 13 consecutive patients (8 children, 5 adults) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who were surgically treated between 2004 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> symptoms were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (11 patients), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (1 patient), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed modified standard encephalo-duro-arterial-synangiosis on 16 sides in the 8 children and superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis combining direct and indirect bypasses on 5 sides in the 5 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative complications were noted in 12 (9 patients) of 21 operations (13 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most complications were transient and no attributive lesions were detected on CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was excellent or good and revascularization was seen in cerebral blood flow studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Effective neovascularization through the grafts was observed in follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The surgical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> has various aspects depending on the individual subject and very specific surgical management might be required </plain></SENT>
