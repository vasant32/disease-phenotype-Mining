<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 7 males and 21 females, and 27 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 11 males and 16 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that 2 muM of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, and 9.1 and 22.7 muM of adrenalin induced statistically significant increases in nondissociative patterns of platelet aggregation in the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum aggregation was significantly increased in the patient group compared with the controls by the addition of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (2 and 4 muM) or adrenalin (9.1 and 22.7 muM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When patients were divided into two groups under and over 20 years of age, there was no discernible difference of platelet aggregation in either group </plain></SENT>
