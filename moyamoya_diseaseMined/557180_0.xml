<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the follow-up study of angiogram performed 14 months later in one case, the aneurysmal shadow was slightly larger than before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other case, craniotomy was performed and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were confirmed to be the saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the basilar head and superior cerebellar artery junction, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these facts, it is suggested that these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were not pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> but sacuular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As for the pseudo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular Moyamoya disease</z:e>, we discussed in our previous report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been generally through that the mechanism of the occurence of symptoms in adult patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular Moyamoya disease</z:e> is due to rupture of abnormal vessels in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But from our experiences, it is suggested that there should be another mechanicsm, which begins with rupture of these basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to that, the growing mechanisms of basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular Moyamoya disease</z:e> is discussed </plain></SENT>
