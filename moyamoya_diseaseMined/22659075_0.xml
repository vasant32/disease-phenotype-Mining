<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has demonstrated associations between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11614913 in miR-196a2C&gt;T and various pathologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A main target of miRNA-196a is annexin A1 (lipocortin1, ANXA1), which is associated with increased multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0002018'>malignant tumors</z:mp> in brain models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine the effects of miRNA SNPs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we recruited 107 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and 240 healthy controls from a Korean study population and determined the genotype of each participant from whole blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the patient and the control genotypes and allele frequencies of rs2910164, rs11614913, and rs3746444 and investigated the association of the three SNPs with age and clinical characteristics, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> or infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rs11614913 in miR-196a2C&gt;T was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The association of this SNP with adult age and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was statistically significant compared to the control group, but the association with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CT+CC genotype of miR-196a2 was represented at an increased frequency among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the distribution of miR-146aC&gt;G and miR-499A&gt;G genotypes was not statistically different between participants who were healthy and those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SNP rs11614913 is significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and adult age in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates a higher frequency of the CT+CC genotype of the SNP rs11614913 in miR-196a2C&gt;T, which suggests that miR-196a2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
