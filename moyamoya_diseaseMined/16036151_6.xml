<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There are a few reports on leptomeningeal high signal intensity (LMHI: ivy sign) on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but the feature of this finding has not been completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to characterize LMHI on FLAIR images in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and to assess usefulness of this finding in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The grade of LMHI on FLAIR images was classified as "absent," "minimal," "moderate" and "marked." Fifty-four hemispheres of 28 patients (2 patients had unilateral disease) were assessed for the frequency of visualization and distribution of LMHI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlations between LMHI on FLAIR images, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels on T1- and T2-weighted images and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography findings were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Moderate and marked LMHI was seen in 31 out of 54 hemispheres (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LMHI was seen more prominently in the frontal and parietal lobes than in the temporal and occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there was a tendency for LMHI on FLAIR images to be prominent in groups with moderate and marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels on T1- and T2-weighted images, there was no significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More prominent LMHI was observed in the hemispheres in which cortical branches of the middle cerebral arteries were poorly visualized on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Leptomeningeal high signal intensity (ivy sign) on FLAIR images is predominantly seen in the frontal and parietal lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because this sign can be seen in patients with unremarkable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels, LMHI is a useful sign in conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
