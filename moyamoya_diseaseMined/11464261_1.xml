<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with renal artery involvement in a young male patient with an African origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 15-year-old boy was referred to our hospital due to uncontrolled blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001262'>somnolence</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e> and multiple lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteriography showed the absence of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> at the level of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracranial vessels presented severe stenosis or were occluded and replaced by an extensive network of ectasic collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abdominal ultrasound examination identified asymmetric kidneys, and renal arteriography showed a tight stenosis of the ostium and proximal segment of right main artery, which was only partially relieved by balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A saphenous bypass from aorta to the right renal artery re-established the renal blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure dropped after surgery and was controlled with low doses of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi> and beta-blocker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After arteriography he presented right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, with partial recovering in the following months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we described the first case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with concomitant renovascular disease in a young adult of African origin, an association that may be more frequent than usually suspected in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
