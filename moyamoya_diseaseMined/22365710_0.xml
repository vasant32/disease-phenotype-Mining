<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The recent introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) scanners has enabled high-resolution 3-dimensional reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to establish a method to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> using computed tomography angiography (CTA), specifically MDCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients (48 sides total) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were evaluated by means of CTA using MDCT by 3 independent observers, and the resulting 144 sides were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CTA and MRA were compared in terms of the steno-occlusive changes exhibited in each vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CTA and MRA scores were assigned on the basis of the severity of occlusive changes in the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTA scores were significantly correlated with MRA scores (P &lt; .0001), and the 2 scores were in complete agreement in 57 sides (39.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean CTA score was significantly lower than the mean MRA score (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with CTA, MRA overestimated occlusion in 115 of the 576 vessels assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean MRA score was significantly higher in the overestimation group than in the good correlation group (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTA had a significantly higher rate of detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>-affected vessels (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that CTA using MDCT is a more reliable technique than MRA for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ability to perform CTA quickly is a significant benefit for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, particularly in pediatric and emergency cases </plain></SENT>
