<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the indirect techniques of revascularization, encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis has been recognized as effective in promoting revascularization and reversing symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neovascularization occurs between the donor artery, either the superficial temporal artery or the occipital artery, and the underlying ischemic cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the middle meningeal artery and its dural branches have also been shown to contribute to collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report the authors describe an integrated management of the meninges for optimal revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They emphasize the importance of recognizing the 3 major layers of the dura and describe a technique of dural splitting at the locus minoris resistentiae between the dura mater's vascular (middle) layer and internal median layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Applying the dura's vascular layer to the surface of the brain after opening of the arachnoid is designed to optimize dural-pial synangiosis related to middle meningeal artery branches </plain></SENT>
