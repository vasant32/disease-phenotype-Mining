<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the Moya-Moya cases diagnosed from 1979 to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the following elements: age of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, sex, clinical features, complementary examinations, neuroimage, treatment and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six patients were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first case appeared in 1979 and the last in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These included four boys and 2 girls, with ages between 5 months and 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial clinical feature in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, noting that in one case this was preceded by homolateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging revealed ischaemic infarction areas in brain CT or MNR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was based on angiography, where in four cases there appeared bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid, or of the anterior or middle cerebral arteries and in the other two there was a unilateral occlusion of the interior carotid and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding etiology, in four patients the dysfunction was due to either fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the carotid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo>, cranial trauma or to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the other two cases no other primary cause was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is an infrequent disease of pediatric age patients, however it is necessary to do a thorough angiography study to rule out the Moya-Moya like vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
