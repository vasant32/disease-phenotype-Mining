<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 15 preoperative cases and 17 postoperative cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the preoperative group, regional resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebrovascular reserve capacity (rCRC) were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reduction was more prominent in the anterior circulation than in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the postoperative group, rCBF and rCRC were still low in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Revascularization increased the resting CBF but did not change the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative CBF did not increase in adults but increased in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the misery perfusion state may be present only in the child's brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of CBF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> is useful to evaluate the hemodynamics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
