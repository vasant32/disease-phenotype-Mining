<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to identify clinically relevant parameters that may be used to develop a novel MMD grading system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 40 MMD patients bilateral revascularization surgery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical data including DSA, MRI and regional cerebral blood flow studies were assessed. Ï‡(2) test corrected for dependency of measurements at the same subject and analysis of receiver operating characteristics were used to identify key parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grading system included: DSA (stenosis/occlusion = 1 point; stenosis/occlusion + intracranial compensation = 2 points; stenosis/occlusion + intracranial compensation + extra-intracranial compensation = 3 points), MRI (no sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> = 0 points; signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> = 1 point) and cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC &gt; -5% = 0 points; CVRC &lt; -5% = 2 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MMD grade I referred to 1-2 points, grade II to 3-4 and grade III to 5-6 points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DSA, MRI and CVRC were dependent factors associated with the occurrence of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Receiver operating characteristics analysis indentified the grading system as superior to each single parameter in predicting clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen hemispheres were graded as mild (grade I), 35 as moderate (grade II) and 31 as severe (grade III); 21% of grade I, 63% of grade II and 93% of grade III hemispheres were clinically symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed grading system allows to stratify for clinical symptomatology in MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future studies will have to investigate its value for assessing clinical symptoms and treatment risks </plain></SENT>
