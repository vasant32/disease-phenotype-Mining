<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In past several years in Japan, there were many reports on a certain group of cases which were called by many names such as abnormal vascular network in the cerebral basal region, spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Cerebrovascular Moyamoya disease</z:e>, cerebral juxabasal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of this group are; 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographically, they show a narrowing at the distal portion of the internal carotid artery, horizontal portions of the anterior and/or middle cerebral arteries with extensively developed perforators, i.e. abnormal vascular network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, it is becoming possible to give accurate diagnosis by only clinical information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cause is not known and so this group has not yet been recognized as a clinico-pathological entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This group of the cases was first recognized and mainly investigated by Japanese neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But they have used many names as shown Table 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a variety of the names seems to be troublesome for investigator and a single appropriate name should be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From the Japanese and other country's reports, the name of this disorder can be divided into 5 categories as follows; Category 1: from the viewpoint of clinical symptoms and sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Category 2: from the viewpoint of only abnormal vascular network on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Category 3: from the finding of the arterial narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Category 4: from the both findings of the abnormal vascular network and arterial narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Category 5: miscellaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The annual changes in usage frequency of various designation about this disorder has investigated and it disclosed the difference between Japan and other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The questionairre about the naming was sent to 306 investigators who had reported the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>And the summary of their response as follow: 1) Most of them agree with determination of a single name </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>2) Their most favorite name belongs to Category 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This means that the most impressive finding was not the obstruction but the vascular network shown in angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>3) The name "Abnormal vascular network" and "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e>" mean the same phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In spite of having many disputation such as unacademic, not including the idea of arterial obstruction, and difficulty to understand for foreigners, but the name "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e>" was pointed out by many investigators that it has many advantages such as being short and humorous, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> also has a meaning of unknown origin in Japanese, and already very popular worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In my opinion, this group must not be called as "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>", but simply "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">MOYAMOYA</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
