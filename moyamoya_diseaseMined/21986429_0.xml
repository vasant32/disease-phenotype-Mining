<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study comprised 12 patients (5 men and 7 women, age 35.1 years Â± 14.7), with 21 hemispheres with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the period 2005-2009, the patients underwent initial and follow-up <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m ethyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32457">cysteinate</z:chebi> dimer (Tc-99m <z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp>) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 3DSRT was applied to estimate regional CBF at rest and CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time-course changes in CBF and CVR in a region of the middle cerebral artery were analyzed, considering the presence or absence of an ischemic event and revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CBF in hemispheres with ischemic events was significantly lower than CBF in hemispheres without ischemic events based on the initial SPECT study (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 15 hemispheres with a hemodynamic disorder, CBF of the hemispheres in which revascularization was performed was increased significantly after surgery (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the follow-up CVR of the hemispheres in which revascularization was not performed was decreased significantly compared with the CVR determined in the initial SPECT study (P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Time-course analysis and quantitative SPECT using the 3DSRT were useful for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes involved in disease progression and revascularization surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regular hemodynamic studies are important for patients with hemodynamic disorders to determine whether revascularization surgery is indicated to reduce the risk of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
