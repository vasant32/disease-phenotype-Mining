<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct and indirect bypass techniques have been devised with the aim of promoting neoangiogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current study aimed to investigate the role of multiple cranial burr hole (MCBH) operations in the prevention of cerebral ischemic attacks in children with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven children suffering from progressive MMD were submitted to the MCBH and arachnoid opening technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten to 20 burr holes were drilled in the fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital area of each hemisphere in each patient, depending on the site and extent of the disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had no recurrence of ischemic attacks postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neoangiogenesis was observed in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a persistent subdural collection after surgery, thus requiring placement of a subdural-peritoneal shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative BI was statistically significantly improved (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This report suggests that MCBH for revascularization in MMD is a simple procedure with a relatively low risk of complications and effective for preventing cerebral ischemic attacks in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, MCBH may be placed as an adjunct to other treatments for MMD </plain></SENT>
