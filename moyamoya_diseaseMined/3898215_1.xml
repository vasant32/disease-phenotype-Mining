<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients suspected of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya Moya disease</z:e> underwent intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and the findings from nine of these patients were reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Obstruction or stenosis of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery and the proximal portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arteriography, however, was better than intravenous DSA in demonstrating Moya Moya vessels, differentiating complete occlusion from severe stenosis, and demonstrating important transdural collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The disadvantages of intravenous DSA included inferior spatial resolution, the need for large amounts of contrast media, and relatively high radiation doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the summation of vessels cannot be avoided using DSA, arteriography is necessary for the precise evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics before bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intravenous DSA is a safe, reliable method for diagnosing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya Moya disease</z:e> and is suitable for the screening and follow-up examinations of patients with the disease </plain></SENT>
