<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> prevents cerebral ischemic attack by improving CBF, whereas recent evidence suggests that the temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> because of postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion could occur despite its low-flow revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study investigates the incidence and the risk factors for symptomatic hyperperfusion after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively performed N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I]iodoamphetamine single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography 1 and 7 days after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis on 80 hemispheres of 58 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (approximately 2-62 years old, 34.4 years old in average) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up period was 22.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion was defined as the presence of the significant increase in CBF at the site of the anastomosis that is responsible for the apparent neurologic sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22 sides, 27.5%) temporarily had symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion, who were subjected to intensive blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging/angiography showed the thick high signal of bypass without ischemic changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>Adult-onset</z:hpo> (P = .013) or hemorrhagic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients (P = .027) had significantly higher risk for symptomatic hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in intraoperative temporary occlusion time between each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients had permanent neurologic deficit because of hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis is a safe and effective treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> and/or hemorrhagic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients had higher risk for symptomatic hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We recommend routine CBF measurement especially for these patients because the management of hyperperfusion is contradictory to that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
