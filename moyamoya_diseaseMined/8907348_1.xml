<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient is a 15-year-old white Spanish girl who had the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the neurological symptoms at 8 months of age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and residual left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral arteriography performed at the age of 1 year revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the territory of both carotids and in the vertebrobasilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of an embryonic tentorial artery, the Bernasconi-Cassinari artery, originating from the right internal carotid artery, was disclosed at 1 year of age but did not appear in an arteriogram performed at 6 years of age and it was revisualized by magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) performed at the age of 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding seems to indicate a very early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003577'>intrauterine onset</z:hpo> of the disease in this case and demonstrates the superiority of MRA over conventional arteriography to discover anomalies of intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Administration of nicardipine, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, added to conventional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs that the patient had previously taken, improved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
