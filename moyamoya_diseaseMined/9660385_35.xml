<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We report the clinical features and longitudinal outcome of the largest cohort of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> described from a single institution in the western hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in Asia usually presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in children and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study population included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> evaluated at a university hospital in Houston, Texas from 1985 through 1995 (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate individual and hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk by treatment status (medical versus surgical) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictors of neurological outcome were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The ethnic background of our patients was representative of the general population in Texas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis was 32 years (range, 6 to 59 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> was the predominant initial symptom in both adults and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 5 had an intraventricular site of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The crude <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was 10.3% per year in 116 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients underwent surgical revascularization, the most common procedure being encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 5-year risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after synangiosis was 15%, compared with 20% for medical treatment and 22% overall for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may have a different clinical expression in the United States than in Asia, and may demonstrate a trend toward a lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate and better functional outcome after synangiosis </plain></SENT>
