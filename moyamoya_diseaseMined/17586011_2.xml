<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of inhalation anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and intravenous anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> on ICP and rCoBF during revascularization surgery for patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1999 and 2004, a total of 90 revascularization surgeries were performed on 58 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, in 20 consecutive operations on 14 patients, continuous monitoring of ICP was performed with an ICP monitoring probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, in 14 consecutive operations on 9 patients (CoBF group), intraoperative monitoring of rCoBF was carried out with a laser Doppler flowmeter probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monitoring of ICP and rCoBF was performed for more than 20 minutes after the administration of <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> was changed from 1.5% to 2.5% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> to 6 mg/kg per hour of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the Paco(2) of these patients was strictly maintained between 38 and 40 mm Hg throughout the operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both the ICP and the CoBF groups, the values of physiologic parameters obtained under inhalation anesthesia did not differ statistically from those obtained under intravenous anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The value for ICP under anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> was significantly lower than that under anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value for rCoBF in the frontal lobe under anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> was significantly higher than that under anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> has potential to provide brain protection and preservation of rCBF in the frontal lobes in surgery for MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether choice of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agents</z:chebi> might be important in surgery for MMD should be investigated further </plain></SENT>
