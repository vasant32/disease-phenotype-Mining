<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoids</z:chebi> and the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> and 8 control cell strains were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The steady-state levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoids</z:chebi> in the culture medium did not differ between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> and control SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the cells were stimulated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> E(2) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2)) release into the medium was significantly greater from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs than from control SMCs, whereas the amounts of prostacyclin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> B(2) did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta-induced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) production by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs was completely blocked by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or NS-398 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta significantly stimulated cell migration and DNA synthesis in control SMCs but had an inhibitory effect on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects on the growth and migration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs were caused by excessive secretion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) and was reversed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies and Western blot analysis showed greater amounts of COX-2 protein expression in IL-1beta-stimulated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> SMCs respond to inflammatory stimuli to produce excess amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26338">PGE</z:chebi>(2) through the activation of COX-2, which increases vascular permeability and decreases vascular tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This facilitates the exposure of vessels to blood constituents and promotes the development of intimal thickening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
