<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The newly-described computed tomography angiography (CTA) Spot Sign is present in about one third of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (PICH) and predicts <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This sign has not been systematically evaluated in patients with secondary causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>, and mimics have not been characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess for the presence of the Spot Sign in secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and to document potential mimics of the Spot Sign and their distinguishing features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> to our regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> center between January 2002 and May 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients underwent a CT <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> protocol including CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CTA documented a secondary cause for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 30 patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient was assessed for the presence or absence of the CTA Spot Sign or a mimic by 2 blinded neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiological features of PICH and secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patients with secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> had a true CTA Spot Sign, but several Spot Sign mimics were identified including: micro <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, Moya Moya, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>-associated calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> group was younger (P=0.0001) and less likely to be hypertensive at presentation (P=0.0114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> expansion (&gt;33% increase from baseline volume) occurred in 20% of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> patients and 28% of PICH patients (P=0.2463) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study describes mimics of the CTA Spot Sign and classifies them as vascular (microAVM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, Moya Moya) or nonvascular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006960'>choroid plexus calcification</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of the noncontrast CT together with the CTA source images is an essential part of the evaluation for the Spot Sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vessels entering the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> from the periphery are indicative of an underlying vascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the Spot Sign may be rare in secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> and most specific for PICH </plain></SENT>
