<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most effective treatment, however, is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the long-term results of 71 patients (26 men and 45 women) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> surgically treated in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They consisted of 56 pediatric patients (younger than 15 years) and 15 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We did 123 operations on 119 hemispheres: 18 superficial temporal artery--middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomoses, six STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses with indirect bypass (IB), 41 encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS), 29 encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) and 29 ribbon EDAMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up periods for each procedure were: 7 years for STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, 6.2 years for STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with indirect bypass, 11 years for EDAS, 5.6 years for EDAMS and 2.6 years for ribbon EDAMS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of each procedure were satisfactory because the preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of follow-up angiograms shows excellent filling of the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in the patients undergoing ribbon EDAMS </plain></SENT>
