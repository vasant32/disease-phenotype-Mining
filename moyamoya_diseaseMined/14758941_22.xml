<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine if a standardized neurosurgical revascularization procedure, pial synangiosis, conferred long-term benefit in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical and radiographic records obtained in a consecutive series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were 21 years of age or younger and underwent surgery performed by a single neurosurgeon during a 17-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 143 patients (89 females and 54 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients were Asian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>Neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> was present in 16 patients, 13 had undergone therapeutic cranial irradiation, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> was present in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 66 there was no known predisposing condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> had occurred in 67.8% of the population and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in 43.4% prior to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the first 30 days following 271 craniotomies for pial synangiosis, there were 11 episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (7.7% per patient; 4% per surgically treated hemisphere) and three severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up evaluation was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient (mean period 5.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 126 patients followed for more than 1 year, four suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, one suffered a severe reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> without magnetic resonance imaging-documented evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and two experienced persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 46 patients followed for more than 5 years in whom the major initial presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> alone, only two <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Functional status at the time of surgery determined long-term functional status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Following pial synangiosis, the majority of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> stop having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, and they appear to experience an excellent long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
