<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The multifocal occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disorder</z:e> may be linked with numerous conditions; however, later stages of this syndrome share common vascular pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study is aimed at characterizing inpatient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> cases in the United States over a broad time span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: A comprehensive analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (Releases 1-13, 1988-2004) based on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9-CM code 437.5 was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Annual percentages and trends analyses were conducted for demographic variables, admission characteristics, co-morbidities, and procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Result: 2247 admissions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> cases were analyzed from a wide geographic distribution throughout the United States between 1988 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at admission varied considerably (mean 29.6 ± 18.5 years), affecting women more frequently than men (61.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Various racial groups were identified (35.4% White, 19.7% African American, 5.6% Hispanic, 8.3% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1.4% Native American) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Admissions were typically emergent (38.8%) or urgent (18.7%), although elective admissions occurred (24.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aside from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> was diagnosed in 13.6%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 20.7%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 7.4%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in 3.4%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 3.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in 24.9% while extracranial-intracranial bypass was done in 8.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> in the United States is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> condition affecting individuals of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages across a diverse racial spectrum and wide geographic distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> may facilitate ongoing research and future therapeutic approaches </plain></SENT>
