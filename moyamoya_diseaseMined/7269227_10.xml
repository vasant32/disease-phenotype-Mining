<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fresh and massive cerebral haemorrhage was confirmed in 14 and cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of 4 of 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these 14 patients, massive haemorrhage was found in the basal ganglia, thalamus and hypothalamus of 9, and in the thalamus, cerebral peduncle and midbrain of 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, fibrosing stenoses or occlusions involved the circle of Willis and its major branches in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 17 patients numerous collateral channels, muscular in type, paralleled the circle, bypassing the occluded natural passages, Rupture of dilated small muscular collateral arteries was demonstrated in fresh and old haemorrhagic lesions in 3 of the 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of cerebral arteries in the subarachnoid spaces was present in two of the 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No rupture involved the perforating arteries in the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> rupture of overgrown perforating arteries as collaterals in brain may be main cause of single or repeated cerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stenoses or occlusions of these perforators are presumably an important factor in the occurrence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
