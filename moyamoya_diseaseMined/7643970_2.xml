<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion (CP) was measured with 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29005">hexamethylene</z:chebi>-propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> computed tomography prior to and after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion was obtained by dividing radioisotope uptake per pixel in regions of interest by that in cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic reserve was defined as [CP after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>--CP before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>]/CP before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> x 100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Amounts of CP in the anterior portion of the frontal lobe and in the paracentral lobule were 0.70 +/- 0.04 and 0.74 +/- 0.03, respectively, before appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter was significantly higher than the former (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic reserves were -11.1 +/- 2.8 and -9.6 +/- 3.0, respectively, at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These two parameters were significantly decreased just after paraparetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> and two parameters in the paracentral lobule were more decreased than those in the anterior portion of the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But these increased again after bifrontal omental transplantation in these two regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, the watershed region was located anterior to the paracentral lobule before appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e>, and widened and moved backward to include the paracentral lobule just before their appearance </plain></SENT>
