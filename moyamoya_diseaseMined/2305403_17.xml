<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major differences between pediatric and adult patients were in regional cerebral blood volume and regional oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood volume was more markedly increased relative to the control value in the children than in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, regional oxygen extraction fraction was greater than control in areas with low blood flow in the children but was never increased in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in the adults, only regional transit time was significantly prolonged relative to the control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increased regional oxygen extraction fraction relative to the control value observed in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may explain why <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> are a common symptom in this group </plain></SENT>
