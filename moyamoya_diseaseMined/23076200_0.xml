<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical value of transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU) in the detection of the blood flow parameters of the distal extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen patients with the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> confirmed by digital subtractive angiography (DSA) underwent examination with conventional carotid ultrasonography of the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TOCU was performed to observe the distal extracranial ICA and the internal diameter, peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the contralateral ICA, distal extracranial ICA showed a significantly reduced internal diameter, PSV and EDV (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the internal diameter, PSV or EDV between the distal and proximal ICA on the diseased side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The internal diameter of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) was similar, but the PSV and EDV were significantly lower in the contralateral CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TOCU can provide information of the blood flow in the distal extracranial ICA to facilitate an accurate diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
