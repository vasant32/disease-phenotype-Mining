<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the posterior circulation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by SPECT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Six patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were studied by SPECT, MRI and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received an injection of 555-740 MBq of 99mTc-HMPAO, after which SPECT images were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral-to-cerebellar activity ratio in five cerebral regions was calculated to assess the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SPECT and MRI findings were then compared with angiographic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 12 posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi>) in the six patients studied, seven <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> (58%) in five patients had a stenotic or occluded lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rCBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five regions significantly decreased as the degree of steno-occlusive lesions of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation, however, was found between the steno-occlusive lesions of the internal carotid artery bifurcation and the rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rCBF significantly decreased in the absence of leptomeningeal collateral vessels from the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> to the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images, the frequency of cerebral infractions significantly increased in patients with steno-occulasive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rCBF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> decreases proportionally with the degree of steno-occlusive lesions of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The steno-occlusive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions decrease the number of leptomeningeal collateral vessels to the anterior circulation, thereby causing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that is likely to result in infractions </plain></SENT>
