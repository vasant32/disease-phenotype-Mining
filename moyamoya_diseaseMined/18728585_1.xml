<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: An accessory middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) usually originates between the A1 and proximal A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery, reaches the sylvian fissure, and supplies the territory of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This anomaly has been associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report an accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> arising from the A2 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cadaveric head, fixed in formalin solution and injected with red and blue <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> on its vascular tree to trace intracranial and extracranial vessels, was dissected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was found arising from the A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery and feeding the basal and inferior surface of the inferior frontal gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our specimen, the vessel was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> at other locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although anomalies of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> are rare, neurosurgeons must be familiar with such anatomic variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> can be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at its junction with the anterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with this anomaly may, therefore, have an increased risk for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and other neurovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By obstructing the surgical view, an accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> may increase the difficulty of exposing lesions in the vicinity of the optic chiasm </plain></SENT>
