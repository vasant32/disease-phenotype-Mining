<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently treated children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> using a fronto-temporo-parietal combined indirect bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three different indirect bypass procedures (frontal EMAS, EDAS, EMS) were simultaneously carried out at three different sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thus treated 16 sides in 12 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> using this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the collateral formation and the improvement in the clinical symptoms were evaluated postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were then compared with those of the patients treated by EDAS alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative collateral formation was more extensively seen in the patients treated with the combined bypass procedure than in those treated by EDAS alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The improvement in ischemic symptoms was also better in the patients treated by the combined indirect bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We therefore conclude that the combined indirect bypass procedure is more effective than EDAS alone </plain></SENT>
