<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied angiographically diagnosed patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared demographic profiles, thyroid function test, and thyroid autoantibody status between MMD and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 63 patients with MMD, 71 patients with non-MMD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 200 healthy control subjects were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of elevated thyroid autoantibodies was higher in the MMD group than in other groups (P&lt;0.01 for MMD versus non-MMD; P&lt;0.001 for MMD versus control subjects) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, the elevated thyroid autoantibodies (OR, 4.871; 95% CI, 1.588 to 15.277) and smoking habits (OR, 0.206 for current smoker; 95% CI, 0.054 to 0.786) were independently associated with MMD versus non-MMD <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated thyroid autoantibodies were frequently observed in patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study suggest that immune aberrancies associated with or underlying thyroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> are also playing a role in developing MMD </plain></SENT>
