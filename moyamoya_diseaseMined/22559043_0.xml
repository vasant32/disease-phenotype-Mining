<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their ultrastructural observations are performed on the tunica media and endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During autoschizis, some smooth muscle cells showed deep invaginations of the nuclear envelope with multiple craters that disintegrate the nucleus, whereas in the endothelium repetitive invaginations of plasmalemma lead to cell demise by cytoplasmic self-excisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During survival mechanism, a perinuclear constriction of plasmalemma occurs, which conserves nucleus and cytoskeleton, and only a segregated cytoplasmic area, without organelles, is removed in lumen </plain></SENT>
