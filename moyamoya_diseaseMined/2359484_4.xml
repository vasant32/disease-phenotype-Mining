<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, by performing a methionine loading test and measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> synthase activity in cultured fibroblasts the diagnosis of heterozygosity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002156'>homocystinuria</z:hpo> (HC) was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only recently it has been shown that heterozygosity for HC is a risk factor for premature cerebrovascular disease in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests that also in children with cerebrovascular disorders the analysis of its pathogenesis should include extensive metabolic studies on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
