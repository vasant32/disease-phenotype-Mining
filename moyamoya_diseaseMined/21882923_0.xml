<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a survey to provide details of social adaptation and satisfaction in adults who underwent revascularization surgery for MMD during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients with MMD who had undergone surgery during childhood and were older than 18 years of age were recruited for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors mailed self-administered questionnaires regarding each patient's education, employment, marriage, driver's license, physical condition, and satisfaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients (53%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the general population, the patients showed a similar rate of attaining a higher education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (80%) of 61 patients who were not currently high school students had entered college or university </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of neurological deficits on preoperative examination was a negative predictor of entrance into a college or university, as well as employment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some patients had difficulty in planning marriage because of physical handicaps, and the rate of acquiring a driver's license and actual driving were relatively low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Approximately 80% of the responders were satisfied with their treatment outcomes, but more than one-half reported subjectively assessed neurological problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, pediatric patients with MMD showed favorable social adaptation in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The findings also indicated that early diagnosis and intervention before the establishment of neurological deficits are essential to children with MMD in becoming better socially adapted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further, more thorough clinical examinations are required during follow-up in patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
