<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> is a progressive occlusive cerebrovascular disease which affects the distal internal carotid artery and its main branches, and is characterized, from a clinical point of view, by a variety of ischemic manifestations ranging from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although considered until recently as almost specific of Japanese population, it can also affect individuals of different origin, and there is an increasing interest for this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> in Western medical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless papers dealing with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in pediatric age are still very rare and almost exclusively limited to isolated case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These considerations prompted us to review our experience with the diagnosis and treatment of such unusual disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine children (seven months to nine years of age) presented with clinical manifestations of occlusive cerebrovascular disease (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological investigation, and in particular cerebral angiography, demonstrated the classical pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of these children underwent cerebral revascularization utilizing the encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) technique, with a total of 14 operations (six on both sides, two on one side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no mortality neither major morbidity related to surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100817'>renovascular hypertension</z:hpo>, died at home approximately six months after a successful operation, probably from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases postoperative angiography revealed a marked improvement in cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in spite of the apparently normalized cerebral blood flow, clinical manifestations were affected less significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In fact, there was only minimal if any improvement in children operated on with an already established <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>; whereas improvement in motor ability was obtained in those presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On the grounds of our results we conclude that cerebral revascularization (by means of a simple operation like the EMS) in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is worthwhile, provided that the operation be performed before irreversible cerebral damage is established; however, even under these circumstances the operation can at least stop the progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
