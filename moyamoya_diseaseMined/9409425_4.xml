<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the surgical technique of combined revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> as well as peri-operative complications are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Craniotomy and dural opening were extensively carried out to expose the brain surface as widely as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the STA, which is the most powerful resource of direct revascularization, should be carefully carried out using a surgical microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The temporal muscle and middle meningeal artery, which have the most potential as sources of indirect revascularization, must be preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis to the frontal branch of the middle cerebral artery is indispensable for improving cerebral circulation of the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A small arachnoid membrane opening and water-tight closure are also important to avoid post-operative subdural and subcutaneous fluid collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischemic events disappeared immediately after surgery in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in several cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> recurred for several months after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> was seen in two cases </plain></SENT>
