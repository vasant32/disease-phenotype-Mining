<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although some possible etiological factors have been postulated, the etiology of this disease is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, some investigations have suggested the association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and HLA in the serological typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, DNA typing of HLA have not been performed yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we performed DNA-typing of HLA in the unrelated Japanese patients with definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (PCR-SSOP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the total patients, DQB1*0502 had a positive association with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, DRB1*0405 and DQB1*0401 showed a negative association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In comparing the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> groups, two groups did not share the same disease associated alleles at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> seem to have a genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, different genetic factors might also be involved in the difference between the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
