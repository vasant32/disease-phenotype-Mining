<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Although most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> are thromboembolic in origin and their management is endovascular or medical, some are haemodynamic in origin and their management may be surgical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed bypass indications, patient selection and surgical techniques used in our current practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Extracranial-intracranial (EC-iC) bypass with superior temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass, high-flow interposition grafts and reconstructive techniques were used to treat patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 13-year period, 152 bypasses were performed for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 129 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specific diagnoses included: (1) internal carotid artery (iCA) occlusion (58 bypasses); (2) <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion and, rarely, high-grade <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis (22 bypasses); (3) vertebrobasilar atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease (2 bypasses); (4) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (65 bypasses); and (5) ischemic complications after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment (5 bypasses). of the 152 bypasses, 137 were conventional STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses. fourteen patients had high-flow bypasses that included 4 "double-barrel" STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses, 6 bypasses with interposition grafts to the cervical carotid artery, 2 subclavian artery-to-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses, 1 MCA-to-posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) bypass and 1 aorto-carotid bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bypass patency rate was 96.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bypass surgery for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> is safe and elegant techniques have been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with athero-occlusive disease, ischemic symptoms and haemodynamic insufficiency have significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if managed medically or left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, surgical intervention lacks supporting evidence from the recent Carotid occlusion Surgery Study (CoSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients will be caught in a difficult position between a dismal natural history and an unproven surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinicians must individualise their management until additional data are published or further consensus develops </plain></SENT>
