<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report 2 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> developed after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 3-year-old girl had received 4,860 cGy of postoperative radiation for optic pathway <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography 7 months after completion of the radiation therapy revealed progressive cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e>, involving the internal carotid artery on either side of the circle of Willis, with abnormal netlike vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 5-year-old girl had received 3,600 cGy of postoperative radiation on the cerebrum for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two years later, she was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> and treated with indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She died due to further progressive obstruction of the right M1 and A1 on the unoperated hemisphere, in spite of well-developed collateral circulation from the superficial temporal artery and middle meningeal artery on the operated left hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that radiation therapy with portals typically including carotid siphon may particularly cause vascular damage, regardless of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> pathology and lead to radiation-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prognosis may be poorer in case of poor collateral flow and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The radiation therapy may cause fatal vascular damage so it should be taken into consideration when a treatment plan is being formulated for young patients </plain></SENT>
