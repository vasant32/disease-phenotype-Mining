<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the hemodynamic improvement of the ACA territory, bifrontal encephalogaleo-(periosteal)synangiosis [EG(P)S] combined with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) was compared with EDAS alone in pediatric MMD patients using brain perfusion SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 36 patients (M:F = 16:20; mean age, 9.5 ± 3.0 years) who were surgically treated for MMD, EDAS was performed in 17 patients, and EDAS with bifrontal EG(P)S in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic parameters consisting of basal cerebral perfusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-challenge stress perfusion, and cerebrovascular reserve index were estimated using brain perfusion SPECT and probabilistic perfusion maps for the ACA and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed to confirm revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the EDAS only (p = 0.04) and EDAS with EG(P)S group (p &lt; 0.001) had significant improvements in cerebrovascular reserve of the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The EDAS with EG(P)S group had significant improvements, not only in basal perfusion of the ipsilateral ACA territory (p = 0.03) but also in the cerebrovascular reserve of the bilateral ACA territories (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In parallel with the hemodynamic changes assessed by brain perfusion SPECT, neovascularization was noted in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in both the EDAS only and EDAS with EG(P)S group, and in the ipsilateral ACA territory in the EDAS with EG(P)S group on the postoperative cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: EDAS with bifrontal EG(P)S induces significant improvements in the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories, while EDAS generates significant improvements in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory only </plain></SENT>
