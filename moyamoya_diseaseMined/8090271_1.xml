<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 23-year-old female, had history of cerebral ischemic attack during childhood and was diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> at the age of ten </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She did not undergo reconstructive vascular surgery but had not suffered from the cerebral ischemic attack in the last ten years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She suddenly lost consciousness in the eighth month of pregnancy and was admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The brain CT scan revealed right paraventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with ventricular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the newborn baby was delivered by cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, an emergency ventricle drainage was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The angiography demonstrated the occlusion of the internal carotid arteries at C1 portion with evidence of a moderate basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> network on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the posterior lateral choroidal arteries was also seen on both sides, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We supposed that the source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was a breakdown of the dilated perforating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels that formed the basal collateral network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also supposed that the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> might be related to the hemodynamic and hormonal changes occurring during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Appropriate counterplans to pregnancy should be made by females with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, because pregnancy may be risky for them </plain></SENT>
