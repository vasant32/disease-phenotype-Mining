<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The near infrared fluorescence of ICG was applied to the imaging of cerebral vessels during neurosurgical operations such as clipping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, ICG angiography was applied to extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery to evaluate the hemodynamic changes induced by bypass in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MD) and non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> ischemic diseases (non-MD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the cortical areas where the bypass supplied blood flow between MD and non-MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography clearly demonstrated the bypass blood flow from the anastomosed STA to the cortical vessels including arteries, capillaries, and veins in both MD and non-MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the anastomosed STA supplied blood flow to a larger cortical area in MD than non-MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The bypass supplied greater extent of blood flow to the ischemic brain in MD than in non-MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference might be caused by the fact that the perfusion pressure was lower in MD than in non-MD </plain></SENT>
