<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: A 30 year old woman was admitted to hospital with a clinical picture of fluctuating paresia of her left limbs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and urgency of micturition which partially recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On examination there was paresia of the left arm, generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>increased reflexes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000324'>facial asymmetry</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On MRI there were areas of marked hyperintensity at T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these took up <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> at T1 and had a serpiginous pattern, compatible with vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On angiography, stenosis and filling defect were seen in the left carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anterior cerebral and left Sylvian arteries were filled by the vertebrobasilar system via the posterior communicating artery and an anomalous trigeminal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical picture of multiple progressive occlusions of intracranial arteries is a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya-moya disease</z:e>, without the typical smoke spirals, which may lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with clinical pictures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303,C0947925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating disorders</z:e> if angiography is not done, since this is essential for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
