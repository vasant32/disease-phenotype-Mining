<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to identify patients who suffer from hemodynamic cerebral insufficiency and can benefit from cerebral revascularization procedures, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT scanning has been established to reliably measure the critical cerebrovascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a need for alternative quantification methods arises, this study aims to characterize the significance of both time-to-peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) in perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) in this particular subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients in routine preoperative work-up for cerebral revascularization were prospectively enrolled and underwent both XeCT scanning and PWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) was calculated for each region of interest (ROI, n = 504) after administration of a vasoactive stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ROIs were anatomically matched with those of PWI after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Highly significant negative correlation was found for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> and CVRC for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ROIs (r = -0.3954, p &lt; 0.0001; symptomatic ROIs: r = -0.4867, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation was weak for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and CVCR (r = -0.1287; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The optimum threshold for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> to detect impaired cerebrovascular reactivity in our patient group was 4 s (specificity 90.8%, sensitivity 44.4%) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ROIs (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> &gt; 4.4 s for symptomatic ROIs, specificity 88.4%, sensitivity 62.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An approximative equation to calculate the probability of pathological findings could be derived from the data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>) was 0.76 (symptomatic 0.78) with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.71 (symptomatic 0.78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While PWI currently is not able to replace XeCT in the direct quantification of CVRC, it may serve as a readily available follow-up tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> threshold of greater than 4 s allows to confirm a cerebrovascular compromise in a selected high-risk subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
