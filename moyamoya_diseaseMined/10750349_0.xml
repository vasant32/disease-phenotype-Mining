<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age: 36.8 +/- 11.6 years) and 11 age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LCBF during the steady state at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages was not significantly different from that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At stage 6, however, the LCBF was slightly decreased in the anterior part of the brain, resulting in loss of "hyperfrontality." On the other hand, the L-CO2R in the anterior part of the brain tended to diminish with progression through the stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Especially in the frontal cortex, the L-CO2R at stage 5 was significantly less than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (p &lt; 0.01) or at stage 3 (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the cerebrovascular reserve in the anterior circulation became insufficient after stage 4, although the posterior circulation was well maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Revascularization surgery involving the anterior circulation may be crucial to prevent ischemic events </plain></SENT>
