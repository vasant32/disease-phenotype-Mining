<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain a detailed knowledge of the cerebral vasculature on computed tomographic (CT) images, multiplane CT scannings on the axial, coronal, Towne and sagittal planes are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have concerned only the axial CT images of the cerebral vasculature, and no mention has been made about the vasculature on the coronal, Towne or sagittal images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper concerns the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the cerebral vessels on the modified coronal, Towne (half-axial) and semisagittal CT planes using 9 fresh cadavers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They received postmortem injection of contrast agents and were scanned by GE-CT/T 8800 as mentioned in Part I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scanning planes were the modified 50-60 degrees coronal, Towne (40-45 degrees off the canthomeatal line), and the semisagittal (45 degrees toward the sagittal plane) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main vascular structures visualized on the modified coronal CT plane resembled the antero-posterior view of the carotid angiogram, and they were as follows: internal carotid arteries (supra-clinoid portion), posterior communicating arteries, anterior choroidal arteries, anterior cerebral arteries (horizontal and ascending portions, pericallosal and callosomarginal arteries and other cortical branches), middle cerebral arteries (horizontal, insular, opercular and terminal portions with identification of the angiographic Sylvian point), lenticulostriate arteries, posterior cerebral arteries, basal vein of Rosenthal (BVR), internal cerebral veins (ICV), subependymal veins which drain into BVR and ICV, choroid veins, vein of Galen, and venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As for the demonstration of the lenticulostriate arteries or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels in clinical cases, the modified coronal plane is preferred to the axial one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On Towne plane, the vertebro-basilar arteries and the ascending portion of anterior cerebral artery were demonstrated as linear densities, which were demonstrated as spotty densities on the axial plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the semisagittal plane, the median or paramedian vasculatures of the main cerebral arteries and deep cerebral veins, were well demonstrated like a lateral view of carotid angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biplane or multiplane cerebral computed angiotomography will increase in clinical diagnostic value for understanding the anatomical relationship between the cerebral vessels and other intracranial lesions, and also will be applied to the screening of small vascular lesions themselves, e.g., asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
