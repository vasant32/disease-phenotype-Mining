<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean hemispheric cerebral blood flow (mCBF), comparable to that of age-matched healthy children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, they had abnormal rCBF distribution and disturbed reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in the territory of the internal carotid artery, especially in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization for the anterior circulation, which consisted of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and indirect synangiosis, dramatically improved these cerebral hemodynamics in the anterior circulation, including the frontal lobe, and reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in the whole brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that surgical revascularization for the anterior circulation should be carried out in order to improve cerebral hemodynamics as widely as possible, especially in the frontal lobe, and may improve cerebral perfusion reserve in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
