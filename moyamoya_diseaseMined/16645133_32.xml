<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To describe baseline clinical features and outcomes of adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> treated at a single North American institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified 34 adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> by review of angiographic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentation and baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors were obtained by chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was obtained prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 5-year Kaplan-Meier <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 42 (range 20 to 79) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial symptom was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, or asymptomatic in 24, 7, and 3 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two had bilateral involvement and 12 had unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up in 31 living patients was 5.1 (range 0.2 to 19.6) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients were treated with surgical revascularization (20 total hemispheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In medically treated symptomatic hemispheres, the 5-year risk of recurrent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 65% after the initial symptom and 27% after angiographic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral involvement presenting with ischemic symptoms were at the highest risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=17, 5-year risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with medical treatment after first symptom of 82%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In surgically treated hemispheres, the 5-year risk of perioperative or subsequent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This was significantly different compared with medical treatment after first symptom (P=0.02) but not after angiographic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>Moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> in North American adults is associated with a high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly those with bilateral involvement and ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a potential benefit with surgery if diagnosis could be made earlier </plain></SENT>
