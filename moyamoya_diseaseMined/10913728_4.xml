<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into the following two groups: those with and those without re-build-up phenomenon on electroencephalography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one exhibited decreased concentrations of HbO(2) and t-Hb during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> and decreased concentrations of HbO(2) and increased concentrations of HbR after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with the re-build-up phenomenon had lower HbO(2) and higher HbR concentrations after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of HbO(2) and HbR reflect an alteration in the oxygenated blood supply and/or oxygen use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is strongly suggested that regional cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and metabolic oxygen disturbances play an important role in the occurrence of the re-build-up phenomenon </plain></SENT>
