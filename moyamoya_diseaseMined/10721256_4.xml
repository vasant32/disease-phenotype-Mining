<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three rare cases of purely intraventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are described, including a unique <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the fourth ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 30-year-old female, a 47-year-old male, and an 11-year-old girl presented with disturbance of consciousness due to massive <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography revealed an idiopathic peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the fourth ventricle in the first patient, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the lateral ventricle associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the latter two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated surgically and histologically confirmed to be pseudoaneurysms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The latter <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> disappeared spontaneously within 2 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the lateral ventricle was resected via a parietal corticotomy with stereotactic insertion of an 8-Fr <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> tube to guide the approach route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method was very useful because computerized neuronavigation was not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the fourth ventricle was resected via a midline suboccipital approach with C-1 laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conservative treatment is usually recommended initially for patients with intraventricular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> because spontaneous cure often occurs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We recommend direct surgery if the size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remains unchanged, because the risk of surgery has decreased recently owing to new techniques for neuronavigation </plain></SENT>
