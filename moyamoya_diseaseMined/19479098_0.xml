<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report aimed at describing a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoyas disease</z:e> in a patient submitted to general anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> for a diagnostic procedure outside the surgery center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Male child, 13 years old, physical status <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> IV, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and neurological sequelae after three previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> admitted for high digestive endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the supine position and after monitoring, inhalational induction was attained through the tracheostomy canulla with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> (gradual inhaled concentration increase up to 6%) in a mixture of 50% oxygen/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An intravenous catheter was inserted for 5% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> solution infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Manual controlled ventilation was started and anesthesia was maintained with 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in 50% oxygen/nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the end of the procedure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agents</z:chebi> were simultaneously withdrawn and 100% oxygen was administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was satisfactory, with good hemodynamic stability, without complications and with early emergence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi> may open new perspectives for inhalational anesthesia in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> to be submitted to outpatient procedures, since it provides hemodynamic stability and early emergence, while preserving brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
