<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous dissection of a major subarachnoid artery is an uncommon cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in young and apparently healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such dissection does not correlate well with systemic conditions such as emboli, thrombotic or hemorrhagic tendencies or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, nor with disease of blood vessels such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, cystic medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-Moya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unusual exertion has been implicated as a factor in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gap defects were found in the internal elastic lamina near the site of dissection in three of four cases of spontaneous dissection reported here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that such defects, because of their unusual size or number, may be responsible for initiating dissection in susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A detailed study of the major cerebral arteries in cases of dissection and control cases to document the size and frequency of such defects could shed light on the pathogenesis of spontaneous dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subsequent course of events tends to differ in the internal carotid and vertebro-basilar systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the dissection in the internal carotid system is sub-intimal leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, while in the vertebrobasilar system dissection lies between the media and adventitia leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is not known what structural differences of the two arterial systems may underlie this difference in the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
