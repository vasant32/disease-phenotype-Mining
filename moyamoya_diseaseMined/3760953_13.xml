<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three had several types of disturbance such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo>, episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, and scintillating scotomata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these symptoms were attributed to occlusive lesions in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual disturbances were seen more often in patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile onset</z:hpo> than in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis and encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) improved the cerebral perfusion both in the anterior and posterior circulation by redistribution of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most cases, the visual symptoms subsided or were stabilized after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These surgical procedures did not, however, lead to direct revascularization in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the visual cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five patients with impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo>, transplantation of the omentum to the occipital lobe led to improved vision </plain></SENT>
