<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 36-year-old man was diagnosed with a right temporal lobe grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0002408'>cerebral arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (cAVM) and was treated with radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At nine months after the cAVM radiosurgery, the patient began to develop bilateral focal narrowing at the M1 segments of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The narrowing progressively deteriorated as was demonstrated on longitudinal serial follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>X-ray angiography performed at 51 months after radiosurgery confirmed that the cAVM was cured and a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of cAVM-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> that developed after radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Given the chronological sequence of disease development and radiation dose distribution of radiosurgery, it is proposed that humoral or unknown predisposing factors, rather than direct radiation effects, are the cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> associated with cAVM </plain></SENT>
