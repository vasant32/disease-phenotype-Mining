<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of the present study was to clarify whether South Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have clinical features similar to those of Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 26 South Korean neurosurgical institutes, 296 definite cases were collected and analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cases were then compared with 731 Japanese definite cases registered to the Research Committee on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya Disease</z:e> of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Korean age distribution patterns showed two peaks that were similar to those seen in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in South Korea, however, was 20% higher than that in Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family occurrence rate was 1.8% in Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in Koreans was statistically higher, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> were less than those in Japanese subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of infarction in children and that of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in both children and adults were also statistically higher in Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was higher in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and sex affected the disease type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although most Japanese patients underwent direct bypass surgery and/or combined indirect bypass procedures, single encephaloduroar-teriosynangiosis was performed on 87.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgical cases in Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite the higher incidence of hemorrhagic type in South Korea, the outcomes of the patients were similar to those of the Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the clinical background of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in South Korea is essentially similar to that in Japan </plain></SENT>
