<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedures were performed for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> and occlusion and used as an adjunct in the treatment of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skull base tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of the EC-IC bypass group trial in 1985 were surprising to many and sobering to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>; EC-IC bypass for stenosis or occlusion of the high internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery did not decrease the risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rather, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased, and the events were noted to occur sooner than with medical therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the known limitations of this landmark study, the number of EC-IC bypass procedures fell precipitously over the ensuing decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this significant setback, cerebral revascularization is not <z:mp ids='MP_0002180'>obsolete</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This article revisits the sequence of events leading to the rise of revascularization surgery and recaps the impact of the EC-IC bypass trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The limitations of the trial are discussed, as are current studies evaluating the efficacy of cerebrovascular bypass procedures for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
