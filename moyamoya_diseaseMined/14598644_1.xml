<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study included a total of 55 patients who were diagnosed as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their medical records were precisely evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT or MRI was performed to examine the location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured in 33 patients before surgery, using the 133-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> inhalation method and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 55 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age was &lt; 6 yr in 32 (infantile group) and &gt; or = 6 yr in 23 (schoolchild group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was significantly more frequent in the infantile group than in schoolchild group (p = 0.0014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Incidence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was also higher in the infantile group than in the schoolchild group (p = 0.0023) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis/occlusion was observed in 14 of 32 infantile patients, but only in 4 of 23 schoolchild patients (p = 0.0474) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean cerebral blood flow value was significantly lower than control value in the infantile group, but not in the schoolchild group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effect of bypass surgery on cerebral ischemic attack was satisfactory in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the postoperative FSIQ value was significantly lower in the infantile group than in the schoolchild group (p = 0.0452) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that infantile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> involves a higher risk for cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to its more advanced stage, and that earlier diagnosis and treatment should be performed to improve the mental prognosis of patients </plain></SENT>
