<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to assess the utility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) for the evaluation of anastomotic channels through the external carotid artery (ECA) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cortical anastomosis and superficial temporal artery (STA), middle meningeal artery, and deep temporal artery by MRA were evaluated and were compared with those by digital subtraction angiography if obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients (24 hemispheres) underwent bypass surgery, including encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis in 14 hemispheres and STA-middle cerebral artery anastomosis with encephalomyosinangiosis in 10 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients did not undergo any surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRA could show these vessels and the patency of anastomosis formed by the surgery and also showed naturally formed anastomosis and ECA tributaries in the patients who did not undergo any surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRA provides useful information for follow-up evaluation on the development of the ECA system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
