<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two cases, the lumen of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery was completely occluded by proliferated connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The characteristic pathologic change was extensive destruction of the smooth muscle cells and the elastica interna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Degeneration and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of smooth muscle cells were obvious in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Many condensed organelles and other elements of cellular destruction were dispersed throughout the interstitium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The media was thinned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proliferated smooth muscle cells in the intima showed the same destructive changes as in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The elastica interna was excessively infolded and was thickened or thinned, disrupted or disintegrated in some segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Identical, but less severe and more localized changes were seen in three middle cerebral arteries (M2 and M5 segments) and two collateral arteries at the base of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These changes suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003676'>progressive disorder</z:hpo> characterized by repeated destruction of smooth muscle cells occurRing over a long time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of these changes is discussed </plain></SENT>
