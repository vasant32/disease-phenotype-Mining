<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether estimates of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography (XeCT) in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> can predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> underwent 22 serial Xe computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Estimates of rCBF were obtained at three computed tomographic levels by use of a 5-minute inhalation of 28% Xe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge was performed in eight scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For comparison of abnormal vessel distribution and areas of infarction, 17 intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms, 47 computed tomographic scans, and 15 magnetic resonance imaging scans were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up exceeded 36 months in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up for the interventional group was 65.2 months (n = 5; range, 37-109 mo) and 38 months for the nonoperative patients (n = 2; 36 and 40 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of six Xe computed tomographic scans obtained at diagnosis, four revealed regions of oligemia, augmented vertebrobasilar flow, and regions of carotid steal after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the delay between diagnosis and treatment, three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in ischemic areas identified by XeCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 posttreatment scans obtained from 4 patients, 2 revealed improved tissue perfusion with angiography confirming successful encephaloduroangiomyosynangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2 others, XeCT performed 6 months posttreatment revealed improved perfusion without angiographic change, and angiography at 1 year revealed failed encephaloduroangiomyosynangiosis and new native collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with improved rCBF had new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 14 Xe computed tomographic scans were obtained within 30 days of angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparison of these studies demonstrates that regions of oligemia were confined to areas associated with vessel stenosis and little neovascularity or collateral pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: XeCT, particularly with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge, objectively quantifies rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary data suggest that it may permit assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and may predict surgical outcome earlier than angiography </plain></SENT>
