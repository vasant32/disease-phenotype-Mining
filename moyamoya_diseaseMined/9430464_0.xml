<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined her cerebral vascular reserve since natural delivery can result in decreased cerebral blood flow during labor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">Technetium</z:chebi>-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> challenge, was performed to assess cerebral vascular reserve since the stress of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> was thought likely to rehearse that of labor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain SPECT images, obtained using 333 MBq 99mTc-HMPAO, revealed maintenance of cerebral vascular reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, whole-body images including the 27-wk-old fetus were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These images demonstrated accumulation in the fetal liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Natural delivery was, thus, considered indicated for this patient, who subsequently delivered a healthy baby girl </plain></SENT>
