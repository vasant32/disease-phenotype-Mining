<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with cerebral ischemic attacks (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group) and 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicoangiographic features and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory were preoperatively and postoperatively investigated, and cortical arterial pressure (CAP) and anastomotic blood flow (AF) were intraoperatively measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, the preoperative rCBF of 38.4 mL/100 g per minute was significantly increased to 42.1 mL/100 g per minute with a diminution of angiographic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in 67% of patients after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean CAP and AF were 25.6 mm Hg and 34.7 mL/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proximal and distal cerebral vascular resistance (PCVR = [Mean Systemic Arterial Blood Pressure-Mean CAP]/rCBF and DCVR = [Mean CAP/rCBF]) were 1.78 and 0.68, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died perioperatively as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean, 67 months), 12 of 14 patients recovered without neurological deficits, 1 was moderately disabled because of the initial insult, and another patient experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> but recovered fully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> group, the preoperative rCBF of 38.0 mL/100 g per minute was significantly increased to 42.7 mL/100 g per minute with a diminution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in 60% after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean CAP and AF were 29.1 mm Hg and 24.1 mL/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PCVR and DCVR were 1.72 and 0.77, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient became hemiparetic because of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During follow-up (mean, 94 months), 3 patients had fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo>, 10 had good recoveries, and 2 had moderate disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a high PCVR and a very low DCVR in both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis partially normalized cerebral circulation and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels but did not completely prevent rebleeding </plain></SENT>
