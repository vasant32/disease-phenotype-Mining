<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the posterior circulation are challenging lesions to neurosurgeons, despite improvements in microsurgical techniques and advances in skull base approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a rare case of a posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>)-posterior communicating artery (PcomA) junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion successfully treated with an endovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient developed severe neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> and shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although her neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> did not resolve, she recovered from shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, her general condition was so critical and her vital signs so unstable, that direct surgery under general anesthesia was considered too risky </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cerebral angiogram showed complete occlusion of both internal carotid arteries without any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> located at the right <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-PcomA junction was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To obliterate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and prevent rerupture, the patient underwent coil embolization via an endovascular approach under sedation with local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The balloon remodeling technique was useful to prevent occlusion of parent arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, four interlocking detachable coils (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IDC</z:e>) with a total length of 44 cm were used to completely obliterate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> using the balloon remodeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient made a full recovery after treatment and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> remained obliterated 2 years after coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the advantages of the endovascular approach for the patient in critical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We believe that this is the first report of a <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>-Pcom junction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with bilateral ICA occlusion without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
