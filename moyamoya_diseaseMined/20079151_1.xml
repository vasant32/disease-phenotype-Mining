<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Standard superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass surgery is an effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but recent evidence suggests that postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion can occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the trendline of changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after surgery were continually monitored near the site of anastomosis in order to investigate both the efficacy of the procedure for improving rCBF and the possible risk of hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Standard STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery was performed on 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF was measured continually using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) until the 5th day after the operation with the LDF probe implanted adjacent to the area of the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trendline of rCBF changes postoperatively was recorded for the analysis performed using SPSS 13.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The baseline LDF value of cortical rCBF was (84.68 + or - 14.39) perfusion unit (PU), which was linear relative to absolute perfusion volume before anastomosis and (88.90 + or - 11.26) PU immediately after anastomosis (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The value changed significantly from before to after anastomosis (P &lt; 0.05); it was (417.72 + or - 21.35) PU on the 1st day after surgery, and (358.99 + or - 18.01) PU, (323.46 + or - 17.38) PU, (261.60 + or - 16.38) PU and (375.72 + or - 18.45) PU on the following 4 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rCBF decreased gradually from the 2nd day until the 4th postoperative day, but still was at a high level (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, on the 5th postoperative day the rCBF increased again to the second highest level, which was significantly different compared with the baseline value (P &lt; 0.05), but not significantly different compared with the values on the other 4 days (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis improves the cerebral blood supply significantly in the early stage after surgery, however, the risk of symptomatic hyperperfusion may exist, which may possibly occur on the 1st day and 5th day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A LDF is useful for postoperative monitoring for both the efficacy of bypass and possible risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
