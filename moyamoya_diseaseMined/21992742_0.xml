<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of an adult patient undergoing cerebral revascularization surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> complicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle-cell disease</z:e> (SCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a 25 year-old male of African ethnicity with homozygous SCD who was experiencing worsening ischemic neurologic symptoms culminating in <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> from rupture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite an extracranial-intracranial superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass that was angiographically patent postoperatively, he subsequently required an intracranial omental transplant to improve cerebral blood flow to the anterior cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to both cerebral revascularization procedures, the patient had continued with his regularly scheduled red blood cell exchange transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The importance of normothermia, normocarbia, normotension, and normovolemia is emphasized in the neuroanesthetic management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the safe and efficacious operative treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, using both direct and indirect revascularization procedures, is being increasingly described, and therefore anesthesiologists are likely to encounter similar cases in the future and need to be aware of the surgical procedures and perioperative implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall principles of safe anesthesia (normotension, normocarbia, good oxygenation, normothermia, normovolemia) for patients with SCD also applies to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a craniotomy, certain deviations from these are needed (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> for brain volume reduction, induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> or manipulations of arterial blood pressures) but they can be safely used with careful monitoring of the patient </plain></SENT>
