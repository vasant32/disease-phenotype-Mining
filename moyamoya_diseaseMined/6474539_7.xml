<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated by various surgical revascularization procedures, mainly by encephalo-myo-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intelligence was tested using the Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC) in 19 children and the Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS) in one child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements of regional CBF were performed by a 133Xe inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the preoperative state, the degree of reduction in the intelligence quotient (IQ) correlated well with the age of the patients; the older patients revealed a more marked reduction of IQ, and the patients with lower intelligence scores in general showed a tendency for more marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of mean CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, most of the patients showed increase in IQ, especially in performance IQ which improved significantly in 10 patients, remained unchanged in 3 and deteriorated in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean CBF increased by an average of 11.4%, and postoperative changes in mean CBF correlated well with the changes in IQ in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This may show that the postoperative increase in CBF is quite possibly responsible for the changes in IQ </plain></SENT>
