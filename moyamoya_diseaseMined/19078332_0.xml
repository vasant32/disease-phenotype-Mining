<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These collateral vessels may rupture, leading to the clinical presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a young Korean woman with known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> presenting with her second major vascular event who was also found to have active, undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her physicians initially entertained a diagnosis of SLE, but when she developed a thalamic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, this diagnosis was abandoned, because a cerebral angiogram revealed a bilateral "cigarette smoke" appearance of blood vessels characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> rather than the similar unilateral findings more typical of pseudo-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
