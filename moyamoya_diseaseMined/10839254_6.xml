<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The collateral vessels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> appear to retain their ability to constrict during <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> but not to dilate during <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been claimed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, decreases the blood flow in regions perfused by collateral vessels, presumably because of intracerebral steal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If this holds true, the decrease in blood flow may be proportional to the global hyperemia in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To establish appropriate hemodynamic control during revascularization surgery, the authors monitored the jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO2) intraoperatively, a method that could sensitively detect global hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 17 patients, most of whom presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or fluctuating neurological deficits, underwent intraoperative monitoring of their SjO2 and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) after a state of anesthesia had been induced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (Group 1) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In eight of these patients, the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the collateral vessel territory was also monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry during the period of cortical exposure, and a total of 113 data sets (averaged values during 2.5-minute intervals) was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was fluctuation in the ETCO2 levels ranging from 36 to 44 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean SjO2 level was clearly greater (p &lt; 0.01) in Group 1 (71.8 +/- 2.2%) than in Group 2 (63.3 +/- 2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An episodic fall in rCBF was observed in association with a transient increase in SjO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such an event was not uncommon in Group 1 and there was a greater risk of rCBF decreasing when SjO2 exceeded a cutoff level of 76% (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This level could sometimes be reached at a broad range of ETCO2 readings (37-44 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, similar events sometimes occurred when SjO2 increased beyond 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this level could be reached only with a higher ETCO2 (42-44 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The rCBF level was negatively correlated to SjO2 (p &lt; 0.01), but not always to ETCO2, indicating that the episodic fall in rCBF was closely related to global hyperemia rather than the absolute level of <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The observed association between a fall in rCBF and global hyperemia supports the intracerebral steal hypothesis and indicates that it is prudent to avoid excessive global hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The optimal range of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> is more restricted than that for <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>, presumably because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> induces hyperemia by itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of SjO2 appears to represent the most practical technique for detecting global hyperemia as well as global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, both of which may cause ischemic complications in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
