<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors confirm the usefulness of extravasation detected on three-dimensional computerized tomography (3D-CT) angiography in the diagnosis of continued <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and establishment of its cause in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> in whom noncontrast and 3D-CT angiography had been performed within 12 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and in whom conventional cerebral angiographic studies were obtained during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noncontrast CT scanning was repeated within 24 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> to evaluate <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings indicating extravasation on 3D-CT angiography, including any abnormal area of high density on helical CT scanning, were observed in five patients; three of these demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> enlargement on follow-up CT studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, specificity was 60% (three correct predictions among five positives) and sensitivity was 100% (19 correct predictions among 19 negatives) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evidence of extravasation on 3D-CT angiography indicates that there is persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and correlates with enlargement of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, five <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> were visualized in four patients, and two diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and one of unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> were made with the aid of 3D-CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Emergency surgery was performed without conventional angiography in one patient who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and it was clipped successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 3D-CT angiography was found to be valuable in the diagnosis of the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and in the detection of persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
