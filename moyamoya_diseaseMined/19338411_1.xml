<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report on the case of a girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular moyamoya disease</z:e> born with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> caused by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000776'>congenital diaphragmatic hernia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardiopulmonary management included extracorporeal membrane oxygenation until the diaphragm defect was repaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right common carotid artery (CA) was interrupted and cannulated for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When she was 5 years of age, the patient experienced ischemic symptoms in her right extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal CA (ICA) with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels on the left side of the brain; the right ICA was supplied by extracranial anastomotic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indirect extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery was performed in the left hemisphere, and the hypoperfusion improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same change in the intracranial ICA with the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels occurred on her right side when she was 7 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decreased cerebral blood flow occurred twice, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels developed to compensate for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the occlusion of the extracranial common CA in infancy induced extracranial anastomosis rather than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessel proliferation, and collateral circulation was formed at the lesion site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that neoangiogenesis requires both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and growth factors derived from the lesion </plain></SENT>
