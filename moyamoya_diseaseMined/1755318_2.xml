<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main pathologic features were: proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and thickening of the intima, degeneration and destruction of SMCs in the media and intima, and the presence of condensed organelles in necrosed SMCs or the interstitium among SMCs, or both outside and within the elastica interna (EI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The EI had become thin, porous, fragmented and was even absent in some segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes are different from those of other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e>, but identical with those at the ends of internal carotid arteries (ICA) reported by us previously, being pathognomonic for MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes in the STA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> reveal that MD involves not only the ICA but also the intra- and extracranial branches of external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The medial <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of SMCs seems to be the primary injury of the arterial wall in MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STA tissue blocks from two cases of MD were stained immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By electron microscopy, IgG-, IgM-, and C3-positive granules were observed on the ER of endothelial and intimal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies on more cases are needed to determine whether an immunoreaction has occurred in these arteries </plain></SENT>
