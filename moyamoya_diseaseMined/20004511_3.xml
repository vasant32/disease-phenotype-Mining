<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the epidemiological and clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in Nanjing, a provincial capital in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patient records from multiple hospitals in Nanjing from January 2000 to December 2007 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 202 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 94 males and 108 females, with ages ranging from 2 to 78 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a dual age peak, one in the group of patients 5-9 years of age and another in the group of patients 35-39 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (81 patients, 40%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (113 patients, 55.9%) and asymptomatic disease (8 patients, 3.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increasing incidence rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> was observed during the period of 2000-2007, with an average detection rate of 0.43cases/100,000 persons/year (prevalence 3.92/100,000 persons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> associated with the disease was 0.16cases/100,000 people-years and the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was 0.22cases/100,000 people-years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This first study on the epidemiological and clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in mainland China indicated an increasing incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with bimodal incidence distribution appearing more frequently in adults </plain></SENT>
