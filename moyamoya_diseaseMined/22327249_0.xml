<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This opened up an opportunity for them to encounter and investigate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, since this disease is more common among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They began to publish their findings on what is currently called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the Japanese literature during the late 1950s and early 1960s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was only in the late 1960s, however, that their studies were published in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The early history of the discovery of this disease is therefore not widely known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1957, Takeuchi and Shimizu reported a case of an unknown disease characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1964, Moriyasu and his colleagues published a report of four child cases with occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also published in the same year a report of five adult cases with occlusion of the internal carotid arteries for an unknown reason, placing special emphasis on an abnormal vascular network located at the base of the brain, which is presently termed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 1968 and 1969, Kudo, Nishimoto, and Takeuchi, as well as Suzuki and Takaku, published their studies in the English literature, which contributed greatly to the recognition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Takeuchi and Shimizu, and Moriyasu also deserve credit as the researchers who reported the crucial features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> for the first time </plain></SENT>
