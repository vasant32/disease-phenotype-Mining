<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: A 14-year-old girl who had been treated with bilateral STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and EMS in 1999 was admitted on January 5, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She showed transient incomplete palsy on the left side of the face and the ipsilateral upper extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the day of admission, MRIs/MRA and 3-dimensional regional CBF measurement using stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> and CT scanning were conducted after performance of plain CT scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MRI and CT studies showed that ossified and hypertrophied temporal muscle used for EMS to the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory compressed the brain just under the muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRA demonstrated well-developed collaterals to the territories of the bilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> via the previously performed anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CBF studies disclosed a low CBF value just under ossified and hypertrophied muscle used for EMS on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She showed same <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> repetitively after January 5, 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The repetitive attacks with the transient motor palsy on her left side was thought to be caused by direct compression of the brain by the ossified and hypertrophied muscle used for EMS and decrease in CBF just under it, and its removal was thought to be the treatment of choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the patient and her parents refused the surgical procedure, and she is treated conservatively at present </plain></SENT>
