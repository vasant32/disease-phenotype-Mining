<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients may continue to experience <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> despite optimal medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors wished to define features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> associated with SCA and determine the results of surgical revascularization in these patients at early and late follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical and radiographic records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> and SCA who underwent cerebral revascularization surgery using a standardized surgical procedure-pial synangiosis-from 1985 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients had SCA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients were female and 6 were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average patient age at surgery was 11.3 years (range 3-22 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with ischemic symptoms, 11 (92%) with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and 10 (83%) with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (92%) had radiographic evidence of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>None presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment included pial synangiosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications included 1 perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and 1 perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average length of hospital stay was 5.7 days (including a 24-hour preoperative admission for hydration) and average blood loss was 92.5 ml/hemisphere (in a total of 19 hemispheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic follow-up with an average of 49 months (range 9-144 months) demonstrated no worsening in neurological status in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No clinical or radiographic evidence of new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was observed in any patient at late follow-up, despite disease progression in 13 (68%) of 19 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and radiographic features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> associated with SCA appear comparable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Successful treatment of these patients requires multidisciplinary care involving hematologists, anesthesiologists, and neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Operative treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> using pial synangiosis appears to be safe and confers long-lasting protection against further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this population, and provides an alternative for failure of optimal medical therapy in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This study underscores the potential merit of screening patients with SCA for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
