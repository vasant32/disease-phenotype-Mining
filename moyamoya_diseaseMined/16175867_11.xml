<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The ability to map cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) at the tissue level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> could have considerable impact on patient management, especially in guiding surgical intervention and assessing the effectiveness of surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper introduces a new noninvasive magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging-based method to map CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative results are reported in three cases to demonstrate the efficacy of this technique in assessing vascular reserve at the microvascular level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patients with angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were evaluated before and after surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements of CVR were obtained by rapidly manipulating end-tidal PCO2 between hypercapnic and hypocapnic states during <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CVR maps were then calculated by comparing the percentage of changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> signal with changes in end-tidal PCO2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Presurgical CVR maps showed distinct regions of positive and negative reactivity that correlated precisely with the vascular territories supplied by severely narrowed vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postsurgical reactivity maps demonstrated improvement in the two patients with positive clinical outcome and no change in the patient in whom a failed superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic imaging-based CVR mapping during rapid manipulation of end-tidal PCO2 is an exciting new method for determining the location and extent of abnormal vascular reactivity secondary to proximal large-vessel stenoses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the study group is small, there seems to be considerable potential for guiding preoperative decisions and monitoring efficacy of surgical revascularization </plain></SENT>
