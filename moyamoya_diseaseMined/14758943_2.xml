<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The authors investigated whether revascularization surgeries in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> could reduce abnormal collateral formations in the posterior circulation; long-term follow-up angiography was performed to assess status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In six patients who underwent indirect bypass surgery in childhood, long-term follow-up angiography studies were obtained between 7 and 12 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> six patients presented with ischemic symptoms at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease between 2 and 7 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic insults did not occur after surgery in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five cases, the angiographically documented stages advanced bilaterally, and in three cases the angiography revealed nearly occluded intracranial carotid arteries bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sides in these five cases, the collateral circulation through the grafts developed well, and collateral formation from the lenticulostriate arteries and from the anterior choroidal artery decreased according to the natural advancement of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no reduction in the collateral formations from the posterior circulation, however, in four of these five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the data cannot directly indicate that the patients in this study remain at potential risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the future, these facts should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of revascularization surgeries, because the hemorrhagic potential of abnormally dilated collateral vessels from the posterior circulation would increase as the advancement of the disease </plain></SENT>
