<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before the operation, the resting rCBF was not markedly impaired except that several low rCBF regions were present in the frontal and temporal lobes, and after the operation, the number of regions showing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional vascular response was more diffusely impaired in the regions with both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and low rCBF before the operation, the excessively high response observed in the parietal and occipital lobes was well normalized after the operation, while the low response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge in the frontal and temporal lobes was not adequately improved </plain></SENT>
