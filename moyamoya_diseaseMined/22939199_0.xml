<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, flow voids in the basal ganglia and cisternal flow voids of the sylvian valley were evaluated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and their diagnostic value was verified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 41 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were included in this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of flow voids in the basal ganglia and the sylvian valley were counted on each side by 3 observers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then the numbers of flow voids were compared between the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> had a significantly higher mean number of flow voids in the basal ganglia and the sylvian valley (P &lt; .0001); however, the number of flow voids in the basal ganglia was 0 or 1 in 69 sides (28.0%) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis using the area under the receiver operating curve indicated that the evaluation of flow voids in the sylvian valley was significantly superior method to that in the basal ganglia (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cutoff value for the number of cisternal flow voids in the sylvian valley for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we recommend a definitive diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should include assessment for abnormal vessels around the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
