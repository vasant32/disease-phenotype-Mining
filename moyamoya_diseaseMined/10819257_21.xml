<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the past 12 years, 85 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were surgically treated by combined surgery consisting of indirect revascularization via encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) and direct revascularization via the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among those patients, the post-operative changes in digital subtraction angiography were examined in 56 sides, including 34 sides in paediatric cases and 22 sides in adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neovascularization after indirect revascularization using the 1) superficial temporal artery (skin), 2) middle meningeal artery (dura mater), 3) deep temporal artery (temporal muscle) was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As results, in paediatric cases, the deep temporal artery and middle meningeal artery induced good neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the induction of neovascularization from the superficial temporal artery was not always good in most pediatric and adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the direct bypass was useful in 90% of adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In indirect revascularization surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the temporal muscle (the deep temporal artery) and the dura mater (the middle meningeal artery) are useful donors to the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simple encephalo-arterio-synangiosis is not always effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The direct bypass is a useful technique for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
