<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 8 patients with nonhemorrhagic MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 6 women and 2 men who were between 23 and 62 years old (mean = 37.8 years) in the sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combined surgery was performed on 12 sides in the 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical results were assessed for clinical outcome, angiographic revascularization, and hemodynamic change on HMPAO brain SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 62 months (mean = 27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical symptoms and signs were improved or stabilized, and the extent of revascularization evident on external carotid angiograms was excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBF on HMPAO SPECT also improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 sides that were operated on with the combined surgery, except for the preexisting infarcted area, on the basal as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> stimulation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had a transient speech disturbance after surgery, and another patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0002908'>delayed wound healing</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis and EDAGS using inverted STAGF/P seems to be one of the most effective surgical modalities for the treatment of nonhemorrhagic MMD in adults </plain></SENT>
