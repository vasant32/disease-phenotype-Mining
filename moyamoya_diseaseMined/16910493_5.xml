<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But little is known about the changes of CBF and its effect on neurological status during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage after direct bypass for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) by the SE-EPI method was performed 4 and 10 days after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis on 11 sides of 9 patients (male:female = 2:7, 24-61 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) 1 and 7 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The time-to-peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) by PWI showed focal decrease at the site of the anastomosis 4 days after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis compared to preoperative <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, and was further decreased in larger territory 10 days after surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral blood volume (CBV) by PWI showed significant increase compared to preoperative CBV in four patients who suffered symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative SPECT revealed apparent increase of CBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and the patency of the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was confirmed by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were discharged without neurological deterioration compared to preoperative neurological status, and none of them suffered ischemic attack after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Postoperative decrease in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> by PWI could be a sensitive parameter for the normalization of CBF after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative increase in CBV may suggest cerebral hyperperfusion and could be the optimal predictor for hyperperfusion syndrome after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
