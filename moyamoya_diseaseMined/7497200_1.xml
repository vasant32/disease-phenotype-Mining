<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its etiology is unknown, and it might be congenital or acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>Neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> and disease of the falciform cells, among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It usually appears as an alternating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here on the case of a 4-year-old boy with alternating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> (initially on the left, later on the right and then back on the left) and angiographic alterations which are characteristic of Moya-Moya </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This patient had been examined in our hospital in the neonatal period as he had malformative stigmas, basically consistent with a flat <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> on the forehead, upper eyelids, and base of the nose, a previous wide fontanella which expanded to the whole of the methopic suture, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, forehead level skin and abnormal implantation of the skin in that region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>What draws attention in this case is the association of middle line craniofacial lesions (<z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, skin <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>) and the later development of Moya-Moya </plain></SENT>
