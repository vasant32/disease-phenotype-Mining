<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Involuntary movement is an uncommon manifestation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may be induced by cerebral hemodynamic insufficiency, which is associated with several cerebral ischemic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors present three cases of limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) or radiation-induced middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, and three additional cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0005424'>choreic movement</z:mp> due to MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging studies and surgical outcomes in these patients were retrospectively analyzed to investigate the pathological mechanism underlying the symptoms and to provide guidance for the management of involuntary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> in cases of ischemic cerebral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient population included two children and four adults with ages at presentation ranging between 7 and 50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The initial presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging finding common in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the frontal <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, which did not extend to the cortex or basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A perfusion defect in the frontoparietal cortical and subcortical regions was demonstrated by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improved hemodynamic circulation in the frontoparietal cortical and subcortical regions occurred in parallel with clinical improvement following indirect or direct bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic dysfunction of the frontal cortical and subcortical motor pathways rather than that of the basal ganglia was suspected to be the cause of the observed contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Direct and indirect bypass surgery can be used effectively to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> in patients with cerebral ischemic diseases such as MMD and in those with stenosis of an intracranial major artery </plain></SENT>
