<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We then compared cerebral perfusion on RPI and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients who underwent extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed RPI using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner and DSA studies in 11 moyamoya patients treated by bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For RPI we placed a selective labeling slab on the bypassed external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists determined the extent and location of the cerebral perfusion from bypass arteries in the middle cerebral artery territories on RPI and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kappa analysis was used to assess the interobserver agreement with respect to the extent and location of the cerebral perfusion and to evaluate the intermodality agreement between RPI and DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for the extent of cerebral perfusion on RPI was very good (kappa=0.89), with excellent location (kappa=1.00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intermodality agreement for the extent of perfusion was very good (kappa=0.89), with good location (kappa=0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RPI is useful for evaluating cerebral perfusion from bypass arteries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
