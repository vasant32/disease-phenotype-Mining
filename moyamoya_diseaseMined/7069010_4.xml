<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the first examination, CT findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in one patient and abnormal in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant abnormalities on precontrast CT were characterized by low density lesions in 14, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> in 9, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postcontrast CT showed the presence of contrast enhanced lesions in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examinations were performed in 13 patients, and the following changes on CT were found in 10 of them: increase or development of low density lesions in 10, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> in 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in 5, appearance of a contrast enhanced lesion in 1, and disappearance of the enhanced lesion in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings at the first examination showed a low density lesion on the second examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormal vascular networks in the region of the basal ganglia were visualized successfully in six examinations of five patients by higher concentration of contrast medium in blood than usual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormal CT findings consisted of those seen in multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> and the visualization of the abnormal vascular networks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic findings on these patients showed evolution as seen in clinical and angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
