<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were analyzed for renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and known vascular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One additional 27-month-old boy with NFvR was found to have extensive vascular changes with renal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vasculopathy indicated asymmetric over/undergrowth of cellular and extracellular components of the vascular wall and implied dysregulation of the paracrine growth mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical studies of affected vessels were done only in the 11-year-old boy and showed positive neuron-specific enolase, S-100 protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reactions indicative of Schwann cell involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vascular changes in children with NFvR are mostly asymptomatic; however <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001920'>renal artery stenosis</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moya-moya disease</z:e> have been reported infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our patients with vasculopathies provoked thoughts in regard to the so-called vascular NF, its place in current NF nomenclature and classification, relationship to fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (FMD), and possible role in infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0100758'>gangrene</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
