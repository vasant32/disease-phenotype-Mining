<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative transient neurological deteriorations topographically corresponded to hyperperfusion areas on SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flows of both the operated hemisphere and focal hyperperfusion area increased significantly after surgery (P = 0.046 and 0.028, respectively), compared with the preoperative ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion may occur transiently after indirect revascularization surgery for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to clarify the exact mechanism of cerebral hyperperfusion after indirect surgery </plain></SENT>
