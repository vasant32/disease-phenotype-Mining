<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass combined with an indirect revascularization procedure, encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis, in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From October 2005 to November 2009, we performed this combined revascularization procedure in 111 patients with different types and stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The superficial temporal artery, middle meningeal artery and the deep temporal artery were evaluated for individualized surgical planning in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The integrity of the deep temporal artery and the middle meningeal artery network, and the pre-existing spontaneous anastomoses of the distal branches of the external carotid artery with the cortical arteries were well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 72.5 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and radiological data were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 198 stomas were performed in 122 hemispheres, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> remaining patent until the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis resulted in extensive anastomoses of the deep temporal artery (100%), the middle meningeal artery (90.9%), and the sphenopalatine artery (39.8%) with the cortical arteries, respectitvely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The superficial temporal artery, deep temporal artery, and the middle meningeal artery were significantly thickened in 88 patients as determined by digital subtraction angiography at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative cerebral blood flow increased significantly within one week after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 6 months post the operation, the relative cerebral blood flow was further increased by 15.5% from the gradual formation of anastomoses as a result of indirect revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>Transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were effectively reduced or totally arrested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits significantly improved in 37 patients, with the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores lowered by 2-8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no rehemorrhage in hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study showed that the superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass combined with encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis can achieve good therapeutic effect in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
