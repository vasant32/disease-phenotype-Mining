<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> require revascularization not only to the territory of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) but also to that of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To revascularize the ACA territory, we performed superficial temporal artery (STA)-ACA direct anastomosis in five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After paramedian frontal craniotomy (approximately 5 cm diameter), STA-ACA anastomosis was carried out at the convexity using a cortical branch of the ACA as a recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An interposed STA graft was used in four patients: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the grafts were shorter than 4 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bypass flow was satisfactory in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient who underwent simultaneous STA-ACA and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses had poor bypass flow probably due to spontaneous leptomeningeal collateral channels between the ACA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our method using a cortical branch of the ACA as a recipient and a branch of the STA for the interposed graft can be performed at the convexity and much easier than in a deep operative field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A short arterial graft does not easily occlude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diameter of a branch of the STA is small and therefore, a size discrepancy does not present a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our STA-ACA anastomosis method is useful and effective for revascularization of the ACA territory in any patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
