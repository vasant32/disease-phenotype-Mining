<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) exhibit narrowed internal carotid arteries (ICAs) because the distal ends of the bilateral ICAs have become progressively stenosed, starting mainly in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the petrous carotid canals in MMD patients are suspected to be more hypoplastic than those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the diagnostic value of conventional computed tomography for MMD patients was retrospectively evaluated by comparing the caliber of the bilateral carotid canals in MMD patients with that in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients with MMD (15 males, 20 females; age range/average age: 6-71 / 26.1 years old) and age- and sex-matched control subjects underwent conventional head computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximal petrous carotid canal diameters of the two groups were measured and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The maximal petrous carotid canal diameter was significantly smaller in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients (mean +/- standard deviation [mm] = 4.70 +/- 0.61) than in the control subjects (5.62 +/- 0.61, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conventional head computed tomography revealed narrowed petrous carotid canals in the MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This basic information could be utilized to screen patients who will require further examination, especially among those with underlying MMD </plain></SENT>
