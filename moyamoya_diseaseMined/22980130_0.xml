<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain perfusion SPECT in MMD demonstrates impaired perfusion in ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a 6-year-old boy with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient had numbness on the right arm and simultaneous electroencephalography changes while studying arms up on the table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> and ischemic symptoms, brain perfusion SPECT studies were obtained when the patient was asymptomatic (SPECT-A) and during the symptoms-EEG changes (SPECT-B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SPECT-A showed perfusion defect on the right frontal cortex, hypoperfusion on the right parieto-occipital region and slightly increased perfusion on the left parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPECT-B displayed significant hyperperfusion on the left parietal cortex; hypoperfusion on the right parietal, right temporal, right parieto-occipital and left frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, brain perfusion SPECT of the child's younger brother diagnosed with MMD showed decreased regional cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Physiopathological mechanisms of our patient's SPECT findings and indications of brain perfusion SPECT in MMD were also discussed </plain></SENT>
