<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographically, the patients-four adults (mean age 42) and four children (mean age 7.7)-underwent a complete six- or five-vessel angiographic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed the following: (1) Despite the presence of stenosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> middle cerebral arteries showed very low-flow velocity compared to their ipsilateral distal internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In adult cases, the difference was very significant (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Relatively high-flow velocity was observed in the posterior cerebral arteries of children, and in the ophthalmic arteries of adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) In several occasions, very low-flow velocity values were still detected despite the fact that with angiography, the respective arterial segments were hardly opacified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relation and discrepancy between these results and the angiographic findings, and the potential application of transcranial doppler in assessing and grading the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are discussed </plain></SENT>
