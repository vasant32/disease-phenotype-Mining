<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular treatments were performed successfully in two patients with major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient with a collateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was managed conservatively and follow-up angiography 1 year later demonstrated spontaneous disappearance of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> show differences in evolution and location, endovascular treatment of major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is safe and effective, and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which cannot be directly accessed for surgery or endovascular embolization may be treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
