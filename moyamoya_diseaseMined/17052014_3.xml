<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But little is known about the changes of intraoperative cerebral hemodynamics and its effect on postoperative neurological status including symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we applied a novel infrared camera system (IRIS-V thermographic system) for real-time, visual monitoring of surface CBF during surgery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (8 sides, male:female= 3:4, 7-62 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, STA were occluded transiently and recanalized, and whole sequence was recorded by IRIS-V system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correlation between clinical, radiological findings and infrared imaging were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patency of bypass was confirmed by this camera during surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intraoperative imaging patterns were divided into two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group A: Change of brain surface color (++) (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group B: Change of brain surface color (-) (4 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transient symptomatic hyperperfusion occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in Group A, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in Group B showed non-symptomatic transient focal hyperperfusion on SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered permanent neurological deterioration compared to preoperative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Characteristic pattern of the intraoperative cerebral hemodynamics as delineated by IRIS-V could be the optimal predictor for postoperative transient symptomatic hyperperfusion after direct bypass in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
