<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a 12-year-old girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical indirect revascularization was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient did not suffer further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> at 12 month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pre and postoperative cerebral perfusion were studied in quantitative single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and CT perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion imaging demonstrated postoperatively increased cerebral blood flow as well as SPECT before and after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the area of decreased vascular reserve in SPECT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> corresponded to areas of increased cerebral blood volume in CT perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion imaging was equivalent to SPECT in accuracy, and superior in spatial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT perfusion imaging is likely to become more widely available as an easy-to-perform technique for assessing cerebral perfusion in a patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
