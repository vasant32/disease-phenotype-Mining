<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and treatment outcomes of young patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 204 patients with MMD who underwent encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, with or without bifrontal encephalogaleosynangiosis, were categorized into three groups according to their ages at the time of surgery, i.e., Group A (n = 23, &lt;3 yr of age), Group B (n = 50, 3-6 yr of age), and Group C (n = 131, &gt;6 yr of age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each group, patterns of presentation and the occurrence of subsequent preoperative or surgery-related infarctions were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes and postoperative hemodynamic status were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At initial presentation, infarctions were significantly more frequent in Group A (87%) and Group B (58%) than in Group C (46%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent preoperative infarctions occurred significantly more frequently in Group A (39%) than in Group B (6%) or Group C (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and a subsequent preoperative infarction was 3 months (range, 1-14 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the rates of surgery-related infarctions among the three groups was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of favorable clinical outcomes was significantly lower in Group A (58%) than in Group B (84%) or Group C (86%), although the rates of postoperative hemodynamic improvements were similar among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The poor clinical outcomes for Group A were caused mainly by preoperative infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Young-age MMD demonstrates rapid disease progression and results in poor clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the necessity of early surgery for young patients with MMD; however, the actual benefits should be verified with additional controlled studies, with long-term follow-up monitoring </plain></SENT>
