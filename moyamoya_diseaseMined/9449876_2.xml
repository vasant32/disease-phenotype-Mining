<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced vasoreactivity of cerebral vessels was also reported in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but its aetiology has not yet been clarified.2 We report here a case of variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>.A 48-year-old man was referred to our hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100749'>chest pain</z:hpo> at rest in March, 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo>, and he had been diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> 1 year earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was a smoker but had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physical and blood examinations, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exercise <z:chebi fb="80" ids="30440">thallium</z:chebi> scintigraphy showed no ischaemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrocardiography during an episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> revealed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, followed by complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>Hyperventilation</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> provoked an ischaemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography showed no significant stenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A provocative test by intracoronary infusion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (50 &amp;#x3bc;g) induced local occlusion of the middle portion of the right coronary artery with ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the diagnosis of variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo>, calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> and nitrates were administered, and he has since had no further ischaemic attacks.Between 1981 and 1997, we examined nine patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (three men and six women) ranging in age from 18 to 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, two men including the present case had variant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001681'>angina pectoris</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There have been several reports of involvement of the extracranial vessels, especially the renal arteries, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>,3, 4 and 5 but no studies have provided evidence as to whether this disease affects the coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be regarded as a systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e>, and evaluation of the extracerebral cardiovascular system is also required in this disease </plain></SENT>
