<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> remains unknown, and pathophysiological mechanisms remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a pluripotent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> that has been shown to play roles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> and many other processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we demonstrated immunohistochemically that the amount of basic FGF was increased above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the superficial temporal artery (STA) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify the function of basic FGF in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we have performed an immunohistochemical study of the STA using a polyclonal antihuman FGF receptor antibody and also have tested immunohistochemical reactions for basic FGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve surgical specimens of the STA from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve specimens of the STA from skin flaps of patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> were also investigated for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sections of the STA from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> showed dense and strong FGF receptor and basic FGF immunoreactivity in endothelial cells, in cells scattered in the thickened intima, and in smooth muscle cells in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the sections of the STA of control patients showed faint basic FGF immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis revealed a significant difference of basic FGF immunoreactivity between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (chi 2 = 23; P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moderately intense FGF receptor immunoreactivity was observed in most control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the statistical analysis revealed a significant difference of FGF receptor immunoreactivity between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological diseases</z:e> (chi 2 = 13.382; P = 0.0012).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
