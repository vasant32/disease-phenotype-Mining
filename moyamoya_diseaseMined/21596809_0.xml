<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: RS-EPI has been suggested as an alternative approach to EPI for high-resolution DWI with reduced distortions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether RS-EPI is a useful approach for routine clinical use, we implemented GRAPPA-accelerated RS-EPI DWI at our pediatric hospital and graded the images alongside standard accelerated (ASSET) EPI DWI used routinely for clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: GRAPPA-accelerated RS-EPI DWIs and ASSET EPI DWIs were acquired on 35 pediatric patients using a 3T system in 35 pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images were graded alongside each other by using a 7-point Likert scale as follows: 1, nondiagnostic; 2, poor; 3, acceptable; 4, standard; 5, above average; 6, good; and 7, outstanding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following were the average scores for EPI and RS-EPI, respectively: resolution, 3.5/5.2; distortion level, 2.9/6.0; SNR, 3.4/4.1; lesion conspicuity, 3.3/5.9; and diagnostic confidence, 3.2/6.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the RS-EPI had significantly improved diagnostic confidence and more reliably defined the extent and structure of several lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although ASSET EPI scans had better SNR per scanning time, the higher spatial resolution as well as reduced blurring and distortions on RS-EPI scans helped to better reveal important anatomic details at the cortical-subcortical levels, brain stem, temporal and inferior frontal lobes, skull base, sinonasal cavity, cranial nerves, and orbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This work shows the importance of both resolution and decreased distortions in the clinics, which can be accomplished by a combination of parallel imaging and alternative k-space trajectories such as RS-EPI </plain></SENT>
