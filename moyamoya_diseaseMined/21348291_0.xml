<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Upon panangiography, this abnormality is typically visualized as a cigarette smoke-like pattern due to formation of new collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The highest incidence occurs in Asia, principally affecting women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case report describes the characteristics of these patients and the way to diagnose and treat them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: A 43-year-old man with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and tonic clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>; because of his age he was programmed to the young patient study protocol and so he underwent some studies like angiography, angiographic resonance and transcranial Doppler, these exams revealed a bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid arteries and its branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The prognosis of these patients is unfavorable when the disease begins in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since conservative treatment may not be long-term useful, surgery should be considered in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of transcranial Doppler is recommended in patients with these clinical features as an initial diagnostic exam </plain></SENT>
