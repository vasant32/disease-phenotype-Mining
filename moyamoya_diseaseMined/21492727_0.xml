<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the hemodynamic changes of the superficial temporal artery (STA) by color Doppler and the correlation between the results of angiography and the hemodynamic changes of the STA after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 26 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>; standard STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GE-LOGIQ9 color ultrasound with 7L transducer was used to monitor STA hemodynamic changes, including peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), mean flow velocity (Vm), pulse index (PI), and resistance index (RI), preoperatively and 1 week and 3 months after surgery in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 22 cases, color Doppler of STA and digital subtraction angiography of the external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA), common carotid artery (CCA), and vertebral artery (VA) were performed preoperatively and 1 week after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the patency of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on angiography, the patients were divided into two groups: 11 patients were in the patent group, and 11 patients were in the nonpatent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical significance was evaluated using analysis of variance of random block design and paired samples t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPSS software version 11.5 was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 10 cases, there was no significant difference among the three imaging series in PSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the preoperative values, the values of EDV and Vm 1 week and 3 months after surgery were significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The difference was not significant, however, between 1 week and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PI and RI at 1 week and 3 months after surgery were significantly lower than the preoperative values (P &lt; 0.05); there was no significant difference between 1 week and 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 22 cases, the values of PSV, EDV, and Vm increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and the values of PI and RI decreased significantly(P &lt; 0.01) after surgery in the patent group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the nonpatent group, the values of PSV and PI decreased significantly after surgery (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>EDV, Vm, and RI had no significant changes after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Higher blood flow can develop in anastomosed STA after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic changes of STA after surgery mainly occurred at an early period after operation with little change at 3-month follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The increase of blood flow in STA may be due to the low resistance of the intracranial vascular bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Postoperative Doppler examination of the STA may predict angiographic results of the anastomosis in the early postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Continuous observation is necessary to identify an accurate correlation between quantitative alteration of the Doppler parameters and angiographic results </plain></SENT>
