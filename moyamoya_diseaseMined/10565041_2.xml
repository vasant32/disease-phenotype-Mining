<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in our initial cases, we found that three sides in two cases had post-operative ischemic complications </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the prevention of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> in the myoflap, when we did EDAMS with dural pedicle insertion, we put into practice the new ideas about shaving the boneflaps to half of their original thickness, and prescribed 20% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">Mannitol</z:chebi> after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tried these new ideas concerning treatment on four sides in three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and we were able to get good outcomes without any new neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
