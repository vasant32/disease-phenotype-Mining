<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured cerebral perfusion at rest and in response to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> in eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD), using the 133xenon inhalation method to determine the effect of large-vessel occlusive disease on vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied three other groups for comparison, including four with bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> (BICAO), 11 with unilateral carotid occlusion (UICAO), and six with unilateral middle cerebral artery stem occlusion (UMCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resting flows appeared to correlate with the severity of occlusive disease overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normocapnic perfusion was lowest in the group with BICAO and decreased in proportion to the degree of contralateral stenosis in the group with UICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hypercapnic perfusion correlated with the apparent adequacy of angiographic collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity was lowest in the MMD group (0.79%/mm Hg) whose collateral supply was limited to leptomeningeal anastomosis from the posterior cerebral artery, but highest in the patients with BICAO (2.72%/mm Hg), each of whom showed excellent posterior communicating artery flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of the MMD group was compatible with the syndrome of perfusion insufficiency with repeated ischemic attacks or a saltatory progression of an ischemic deficit; CT showed infarction in the borderzone territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a severely reduced hypercapnic response may help to identify patients with ischemic syndromes due to perfusion failure in the borderzones, as in MMD </plain></SENT>
