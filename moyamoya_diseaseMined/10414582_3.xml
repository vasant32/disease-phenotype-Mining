<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to detect proteins associated with the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and four control patients who had cervical lesions but no intracranial lesion were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: CSF proteins separated by two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis were analyzed with the SWISS-2DPAGE and SWISS-PROT databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the CSF samples from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> spot (Mr = 12,000, pI = 5.35) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This spot was not evident in samples from the four control patients and has not been reported in the SWISS-2DPAGE and SWISS-PROT databases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A CSF protein, which is possibly novel and associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, has been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of CSF by two-dimensional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis may reveal a clue by which the molecular mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may be elucidated </plain></SENT>
