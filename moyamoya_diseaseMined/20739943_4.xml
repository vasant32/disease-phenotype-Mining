<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Once symptomatic, insufficient cerebral blood flow or rupture of the fragile collaterals may cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, resulting in severe neurological dysfunction or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The etiology of MMD is still unknown, although few associations with other diseases and environmental factors have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Strong regional differences in epidemiological data, as well as known familial cases, turned the focus to genetics for the insight into the disease's pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus far, several reports have suggested specific genetic loci and individual genes as predisposing to MMD, but none have demonstrated reproducible results in independent cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small sample sizes, as well as a likely multifactorial origin, seem to be the most challenging tasks in identifying the disease-causing mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once identified, susceptibility genes may allow preventive screening and a possible development of novel therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
