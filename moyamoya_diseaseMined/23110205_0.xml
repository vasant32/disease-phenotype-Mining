<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) is an uncommon cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive occlusion of the internal carotid artery causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of MMD are being increasingly recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the RNF213 gene was related to MMD susceptibility in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there is no large scale study of the association between this gene and MMD in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus we designed this case-control study to validate the R4810K mutation and to define the further spectrum of RNF213 mutations in Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genotyping of the R4810K mutation in the RNF213 gene was performed in 170 MMD cases and 507 controls from a Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The R4810K mutation was identified in 22 of 170 MMD cases (13%), including 21 heterozygotes and a single familial homozygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the 507 controls (0.4%) were heterozygous R4810K carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The R4810K mutation greatly increased the risk for MMD (OR = 36.7, 95% CI: 8.6~156.6, P = 6.1 E-15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of R4810K was significantly different between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (OR = 5.4, 95% CI: 1.8~16.1, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genomic sequencing covering RNF213 exon 40 to exon 68 also identified eight other non-R4810K variants; P4007R, Q4367L, A4399T, T4586P, L4631V, E4950D, A5021V and M5136I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among them A4399T polymorphism was found in 28/170 cases (16.5%) and 45/507 controls (8.9%) and was associated with MMD (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2~3.3, P = 0.004), especially with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (OR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.2~6.5, P = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: RNF213 mutations are associated with MMD susceptibility in Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The ischemic type MMD is particularly related to the R4810K mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, A4399T is also a susceptible variant for MMD, primarily associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Identification of novel variants in the RNF213 gene further highlights the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of MMD </plain></SENT>
