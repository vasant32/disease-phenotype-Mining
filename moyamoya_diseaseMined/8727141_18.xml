<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 124 children younger than 15 years who underwent surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, 21 (16.9%) experienced perioperative ischemic complications that could not be unequivocally attributed to the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 21 patients experienced infarctions, and 10 experienced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischemic neurological deficits</z:e> without new lesions, as revealed by computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An examination of the patients' perioperative clinical and laboratory data revealed that the mean values of intra- and postoperative minimum arterial carbon dioxide pressure, maximum arterial carbon dioxide pressure, and mean arterial pressure were similar in patients with and without ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with perioperative complications, the incidence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and intra- and postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (maximum arterial carbon dioxide pressure &gt; 45 mm Hg) was significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 7 of the 11 perioperative infarctions occurred in patients with frequent preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and intra- and postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow studies with preoperative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading showed that the new infarctions were located in areas in which the cerebral blood flow had been compromised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the occurrence of frequent preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> is an important indicator of the instability of the cerebral hemodynamics and of the risk of perioperative ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To prevent these complications, preoperative management aimed at stabilizing the hemodynamic status is very important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Children who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and who experience frequent preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are at risk for ischemic brain damage caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> as well as <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The establishment and maintenance of normocapnia with normotension are highly desirable for the perioperative management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
