<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Brain revascularization was performed using a direct superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass or indirect encephalo-dural-arterial synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CVR was measured pre- and 3 months postoperatively using blood oxygen level-dependent MRI during iso-oxic hypercapnic changes in end-tidal carbon dioxide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were assessed by MRI, clinical examination, and modified Rankin Scale scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-five hemispheres were revascularized in 39 patients (superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery in 47, encephalo-dural-arterial synangiosis in 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgery reversed CVR impairment in 52 hemispheres (94.5%) and in 36 of 39 patients (92.3%; Fisher exact test, P&lt;0.001), and this was predictive of a patent extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New, clinically silent perioperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, cortical foci of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, or new white matter T2 hyperintensities were detected after 11 surgeries (20%), but no new lesions arose after 3 postoperative months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had a clinical perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In clinical follow-up, 37 of 39 patients (95%) had stable or improved modified Rankin Scale scores and 2 patients (5.1%) worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patients with patent bypasses or CVR improvements exhibited new clinical symptoms, but failure of CVR improvement corresponded to a poorer long-term outcome (Fisher exact test, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral revascularization surgery is a safe and effective treatment for reversing preoperative CVR defects and may prevent recurrence of preoperative symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CVR measurements may be useful in long-term follow-up and for predicting bypass patency </plain></SENT>
