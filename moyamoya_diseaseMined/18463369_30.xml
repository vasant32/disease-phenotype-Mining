<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, etiology of the disease has remained largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We previously showed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> pattern of MMD is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the genome-wide parametric linkage analysis for MMD in 15 extended Japanese families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conducted linkage analyses under two diagnostic classifications: narrow and broad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Affected member-only analysis was applied due to incomplete and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003831'>age-dependent penetrance</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under both classifications, significant evidence of linkage was only observed on chromosome 17q25.3, with maximum multipoint logarithm of odds (lod) scores of 6.57 (under the narrow classification) and 8.07 (under the broad classification) at D17S704 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haplotype analysis revealed segregation of a disease haplotype in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> families but one, and informative crossovers enabled mapping of the MMD locus to a 3.5-Mb region between D17S1806 and the telomere of 17q, encompassing 94 annotated genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is a major gene locus for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> on chromosome 17q25.3 </plain></SENT>
