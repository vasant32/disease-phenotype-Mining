<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The advent of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has enabled images with good spatial resolution to be obtained over a wide range in a short scanning time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether CT angiography using the MDCT system could effectively depict extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass routes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Helical CT angiography was performed using an MDCT scanner in 12 patients who had undergone EC-IC bypass surgery: 10 patients had undergone superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis, 1 patient had undergone an encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis procedure for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and 1 patient had undergone an external carotid artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis using a graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting CT angiograms were visually evaluated for their depiction of the EC-IC bypass route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional angiograms were available for comparison in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EC-IC bypass was visualized to be patent at the site of anastomosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> secondary or more to those connected to a donor artery were demonstrated in 9 patients, whereas <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches immediately distal to the anastomosis were demonstrated in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CT angiography findings corresponded well with the conventional angiography findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Helical CT angiography using the MDCT technique is an effective method for visualizing EC-IC bypass routes </plain></SENT>
