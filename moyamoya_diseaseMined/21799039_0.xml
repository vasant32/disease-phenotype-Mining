<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: SWI is a high spatial resolution <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging technique showing magnetic inhomogeneity that could demonstrate increased oxygen extraction in focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics in the signal intensity of DMVs by using SWI and to determine whether this method could indicate the severity of the hemodynamics in MMD by evaluating the correlation between SWI stage and hemodynamics on SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive MMD patients were prospectively analyzed before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Routine <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging including SWI was performed, and the number of the conspicuous DMVs draining into the subependymal veins was classified: stage 1, mild (&lt; 5); stage 2, moderate (5-10); and stage 3, severe (&gt; 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The SWI stage was evaluated in correlation with clinical presentations, and CBF and CVR were quantified by using a SPECT <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> 123 N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine split-dose method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were 12 males and 21 females (range, 8-66 years), consisting of 4 asymptomatic patients, 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 9 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, and 7 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant difference in CVR among clinical presentations, though there was no difference in age, Suzuki stage, or CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, SWI stage was significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> than asymptomatic patients (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher SWI stage significantly had lower CBF and CVR in the middle cerebral artery area (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SWI stage strongly correlates with ischemic presentations in MMD and also correlates with hemodynamics on SPECT, especially CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increased conspicuity of DMVs, known as "brush sign", could predict the severity of MMD </plain></SENT>
