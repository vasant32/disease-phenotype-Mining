<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Profound T2 shortening in the deep grey and white matter was observed in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in two cases, which changed to high intensity in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage; in this stage no T2 shortening was demonstrated in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither haemorrhagic infarction nor calcification was seen on CT or MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There could be longitudinally different T2 shortening patterns between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and other disorders </plain></SENT>
