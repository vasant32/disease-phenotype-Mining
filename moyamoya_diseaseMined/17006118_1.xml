<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 59 childhood patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty were classified as hypertensive group when the mean arterial pressure in the postoperative recovery room was 120% or greater than that during the preoperative period and 29 were classified as normotensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 2 groups were compared with respect to preoperative indices of heart rate variability including frequency-domain measures, approximate entropy, and very short-term multifractal Hurst exponents of RR intervals (RRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using preoperative indices that showed significant differences, discriminant analysis was performed to identify postoperative hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only exponents of the order &gt; or =3 (H3alpha, H4alpha, and H5alpha) were significantly lower in the hypertensive group than in the normotensive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequency-domain measures, approximate entropy, and the exponents of the order &lt; or =2 were not significantly different in the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discriminant analysis using <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the three exponents correctly identified 27/30 (90%) of the postoperative hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative very short-term multifractal Hurst analysis of RRI variability identified 90% of childhood MMD patients who developed postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The preoperative characteristic of RRI variability was the reduced smoothness at the 8-second-long, local RRI regions within which a very large change of RRI occurs </plain></SENT>
