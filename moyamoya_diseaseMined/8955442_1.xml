<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the exception of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, there is no effective treatment for these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One potential approach is encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is a safe neurosurgical procedure that promotes spontaneous transdural anastomosis that may provide additional blood flow to ischaemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present eight children with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and discuss surgical attempts to treat this entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the eight children was 3.6 years (range: 13 months to 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had occurred in association with a head injury in three children, but without an apparent cause in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five children underwent stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced computed tomography to evaluate cerebral blood flow and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient underwent EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One child with no angiographic abnormalities recovered to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological state without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, another child also fully recovered, and the remaining six children recovered with only a slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was observed on a follow-up angiogram in three children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our surgical experiences suggest that revascularization is influenced by haemodynamic demand and recanalization of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We favour the use of indirect anastomosis (EDAS) for selected patients and suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> probably contributes to surgical success </plain></SENT>
