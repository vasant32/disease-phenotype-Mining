<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper demonstrates the scope of perfusion transcranial sonography (p-TCS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: P-TCS was performed in an axial insonation plane through the thalamus and third ventricle in a case with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and a patient with bilateral thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal cerebral veins, and compared to results in 10 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Signal increase induced by a bolus of an echo-contrast agent (Optison trade mark ) was quantified in regions of interest (ROI) in the thalamus (TH), lentiform nucleus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) and the cerebral white matter (WM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> p-TCS could demonstrate a decreased perfusion in the WM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> as a result of bilateral, high-grade stenoses of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak intensity was increased in the TH due to collateral cross-over flow from the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TH perfusion was decreased in <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005305'>cerebral vein thrombosis</z:hpo> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extention of the thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> into the white matter could also be demonstrated by decreased perfusion in the adjacent WM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ROI ratios of different tissues proved helpful in quantifying the perfusion results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P-TCS is a new, promising technique that can supply information on pathological brain tissue perfusion at the patient's bed-side </plain></SENT>
