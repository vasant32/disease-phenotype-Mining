<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study protocols were approved by the local ethics committee; written informed consent was obtained from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included 24 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (four male and 20 female patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients ranged in age from 17 to 66 years (mean age, 41 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> had been diagnosed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before they were entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent 3D TOF <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography at both 3.0 and 1.5 T; imaging examinations were performed within 14 days of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximum intensity projections (MIPs) obtained with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography performed at both 3.0 and 1.5 T were evaluated by two neuroradiologists; the visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels was graded according to a 4-point scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both 3.0- and 1.5-T imaging, the number of high-signal-intensity areas and the summation of cross-sectional areas of high signal intensity on source images obtained at the same level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were compared quantitatively by using the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels were better visualized on MIPs obtained with 3.0-T imaging than on MIPs obtained with 1.5-T imaging (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the identical level of the source image, 3.0-T imaging depicted more high-signal-intensity areas than did 1.5-T imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Wider cross-sectional areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were visualized with 3.0-T imaging than with 1.5-T imaging (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels are better depicted with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T </plain></SENT>
