<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stenosis or occlusion due to fibrocellular intimal thickening in the intracranial major arteries is thought to be the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but its etiology and pathogenesis are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to analyze cellular components of the lesions and their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Stenotic or occlusive intracranial arterial lesions were collected from six autopsied patients who died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular components were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining using cell-type-specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sections were also immunostained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to detect proliferating cells and for two different types of intermediate filaments, desmin and vimentin, to evaluate phenotypes of the intimal smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The thickened intima was composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells with an admixture of some macrophages and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macrophages and T cells were scattered in the superficial layer of the intimal thickening, and these were occasionally associated with organization of fibrin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proliferating smooth muscle cells, indicated by PCNA-positive nuclei and muscle actin-positive cytoplasm, were found in the thickened intima in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for intermediate filaments revealed intimal smooth muscle cells showing positive staining for vimentin and negative staining for desmin, compatible with the phenotype of synthetic smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides evidence that smooth muscle cells are proliferating in the occlusive lesions in intracranial major arteries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The colocalization of inflammatory cells and PCNA-positive cells suggests that inflammatory stimuli may induce proliferative response of smooth muscle and contribute to the formation of the intracranial occlusive lesions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
