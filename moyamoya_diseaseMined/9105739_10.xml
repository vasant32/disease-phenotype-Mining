<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, 8 patients developed ischemic complications (5 with minor completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three factors including the presence of a preoperative low density area (LDA), intra-operative urinary output, and a reduction in the hematocrit significantly differed with complications and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an evaluation of individual cases, intra-operative <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and a reduction in the circulating blood volume also were identified as potential factors associated with complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, it was concluded that it is necessary to infuse an adequate amount of fluids, maintain normocapnic and normothermic states, and actively correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients undergoing vascular reconstruction for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also necessary to pay particular attention to perioperative care in patients in whom a LDA is detected by preoperative CT </plain></SENT>
