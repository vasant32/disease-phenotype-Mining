<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings consisted of occlusion of arteries, collateral vessels and parenchymal changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Narrowing or occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hemispheres but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collateral vessels, cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the ventricles were observed on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
