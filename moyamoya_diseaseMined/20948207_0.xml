<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The important role of genetic factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of MMD is being increasingly recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to examine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) genes with MMD occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five functional promoter polymorphisms in the MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9 and MMP-13 genes and a potentially functional promoter polymorphism in the TIMP-2 gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their associations with MMD were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 208 definite patients with MMD (including 31 familial MMD, FMMD, patients) and 224 healthy subjects were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the MMP-3 5A/6A and 5A/5A genotypes was significantly lower in MMD patients (OR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.86, p(corr) = 0.042) compared with healthy controls in a dominant genetic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant differences of the MMP-3 5A/6A polymorphism were also detected between FMMD patients and controls both in the dominant genetic model (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.68, p(corr) = 0.048) and the additive genetic model (OR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.69, p(corr) = 0.048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The functional polymorphism in the MMP-3 promoter might be associated with susceptibility to both MMD and FMMD in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings need to be validated in further studies including more subjects from different populations </plain></SENT>
