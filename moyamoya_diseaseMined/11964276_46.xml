<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three patients with homozygous sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (HbSS) and 1 with HbSO(Arab) (16 females, 28 males) who had suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> while under the age of 18 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been on transfusions aimed at maintaining the sickle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbS) level below 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were followed for a mean of 6.6 years (2.2 to 20.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of collaterals was diagnosed based on either magnetic resonance angiography or conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (41%) of the 44 patients suffered recurrent CVEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (43%) (6 females, 13 males) patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven (58%) of these 19 experienced 21 total recurrent CVEs, including 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in 4 patients (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison, 7 (28%) of 25 patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collaterals experienced 9 recurrent CVEs (P &lt;.05) with only 1 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients were also more likely to have 2 recurrent CVEs (42% vs 8%, P &lt;.05) as well as poorer neuropsychological testing results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> were more than twice as likely to incur a subsequent CVE (hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.85, 6.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that up to 41% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> experience recurrent CVEs after an initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusions and that the risk of recurrence is significantly higher for those who have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collaterals </plain></SENT>
