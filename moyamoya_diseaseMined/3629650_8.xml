<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of the attacks, the regional cerebral blood flow was measured during rest and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in children aged 3-16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow during rest was significantly higher in younger children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, and it progressively decreased with advancing age through childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, regional cerebral blood flow decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children, although blood flow in younger children was still higher than that in the older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were more readily precipitated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> in the younger than in the older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral metabolic demand is much higher in the first decade of life than in later decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems likely that even a moderate reduction in cerebral blood flow can cause metabolic impairment in young children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such high cerebral metabolic demand may play an important role in the frequent occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in young children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
