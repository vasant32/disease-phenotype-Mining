<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The patient is a 35-year-old man who had a medical history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He came to our hospital because of transient disturbance of consciousness and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> just after evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At first, we thought that he had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with Todd's palsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But we had to do a differential diagnosis for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238096" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">paradoxical embolism</z:e>, because his symptoms occurred just after evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An electroencephalogram and brain computerized tomography were immediately performed, but no abnormality was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematologic studies were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> was detected in the veins of the lower extremities by duplex ultrasonography Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But carotid duplex ultrasonography showed an increase in end-diastolic flow velocity and a decrease in vascular resistance in both external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicated that there was <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed spotty high signal lesions in the subcortical areas on a fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery(FLAIR) image, and the middle cerebral artery was not visualized on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography demonstrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the brain and collateral circulation from the external carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we diagnosed him as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasonography of the common and, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries is a widely-used technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recently, cerebral angiography, MRA and transcranial Doppler have been applied to detect intracranial vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>But these results suggested that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> could be detected by means of carotid duplex ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, we considered that carotid duplex ultrasonography was not only a noninvasive screening method but also a useful for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
