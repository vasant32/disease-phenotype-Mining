<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the current study were to examine intellectual and executive functioning of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> and to evaluate the impact of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> type, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (clinical or silent), vasculopathy laterality, and disease duration on neurocognitive abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD:   Thirty pediatric participants (mean age 10 y 10 mo, SD 4 y; 18 females, 12 males) completed age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scales before any therapeutic revascularization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reports of executive function were obtained from parents and teachers using the Behavior Rating Index of Executive Function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:   Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> scored significantly lower than the test standardization samples on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> indices of intelligence and ratings of executive functioning (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients did not differ by type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> or history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> scored significantly lower than those with unilateral disease on measures of overall intellectual function (p=0.035) and verbal comprehension (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Deficits in metacognitive executive functions were also more pronounced in bilateral patients according to teacher ratings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION:   Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> are at risk for intellectual and executive problems, exacerbated by bilateral disease and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history </plain></SENT>
