<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to previous reports, computed tomography (CT) reveals multiple low density areas in the brain, with atrophic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on this review of six cases, CT with contrast enhancement often reveals tortuous, curvilinear vessels in the basal ganglia, corresponding to extensive parenchymal and leptomeningeal collaterals on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most proximal portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries are often poorly visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When multiple low density areas or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhages</z:hpo> are encountered on CT, these findings in the basal ganglia should be sought for differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
