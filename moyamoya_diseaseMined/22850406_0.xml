<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed cerebral perfusion and metabolism using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) or single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) before and after bypass surgery on 42 sides of 34 adult patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven cases (16.7%) with symptomatic hyperperfusion, diagnosed by qualitative (123)I-iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) SPECT, a subsequent PET study during postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> stages revealed significantly increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) from 34.1 ± 8.2 to 74.3 ± 12.8 mL/100 g per minute (P&lt;0.01), a persistent increase in cerebral blood volume (CBV) from 5.77 ± 1.67 to 7.01 ± 1.44 mL/100 g and a significant decrease in oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) from 0.61 ± 0.09 to 0.40 ± 0.08 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean absolute CBF values during symptomatic hyperperfusion were more than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control +2 standard deviations, the predefined criteria of PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, two patients with markedly increased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) at hyperperfusion were complicated with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among preoperative PET parameters, increased OEF was the only significant risk factor for symptomatic hyperperfusion (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that symptomatic hyperperfusion in MMD is characterized by temporary increases in CBF &gt;100% over preoperative values caused by prolonged recovery of increased CBV </plain></SENT>
