<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood flow to abnormal net-like vessels (ANV) in the base of the brain is mainly supplied from the internal carotid artery (ICA) in the early stage of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a later stage, however, the blood supply is mainly from the posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though, no remarkable change was found in the volumes of ANV from the early to later stages of the disease, the leptomeningeal collaterals, the most prominent anastomoses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, had a tendency to decrease during the later stage with the development of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen occlusive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions were found in the proximal portion of the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> in eight cases (44%), and in the distal in nine cases (50%) </plain></SENT>
