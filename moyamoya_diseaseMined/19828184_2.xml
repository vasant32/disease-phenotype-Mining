<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We report a precise technique for EC-IC bypass surgery using a stereoscopic high-resolution microscope at magnifications of 40x and 50x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A stereoscopic operating microscope (Mitaka MM50 Surgical Microscope; Mitaka Kohoki Co, Tokyo, Japan) was used in STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This microscope has 2 optical systems, a standard zooming system, a newly developed high-magnification system, and 4 fixed working distances of 200, 250, 300 and 350 mm, with highest magnifications of 50.4x at 200 mm and 40.3x at 250 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High resolution is achieved by a new lens design in the optical system, which makes the image of the object very clear at high magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The magnification can be changed depending on the circumstances in a given procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses were performed using this microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Very small vessels were observable, and arterial anastomosis could be performed precisely at high magnification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> anastomoses were patent on postoperative angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of the new microscope allows visualization and manipulation of small vessels at high magnification and high resolution and may be very useful in EC-IC bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
