<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was mainly based on CT, Digital subtraction angiography was conducted on 130 cases and pathological examination was conducted on 78 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was seen in 195 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> in 73.5% of the patients (150/204) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main manifestations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (70.6%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (50%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007185'>loss of consciousness</z:hpo> (22.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036572,C0009951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">convulsion</z:e> (21.6%), and focal neurological deficits (13.2%) </plain></SENT>
