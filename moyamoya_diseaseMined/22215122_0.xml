<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Standard superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass surgery is an effective treatment for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose in this study was to evaluate the ischemic status based on the imaging modality of computed tomographic perfusion (<z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>) before and after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> was performed on 19 patients, comprising 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and nine patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease, preoperatively and on the third postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to the regional cerebral microcirculatory change and modality of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi>, the regional cerebral ischemic status was graded into two stages with four substages (I1, I2, II1, and II2) to indicate the regional cerebral perfusion and ischemic status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ischemic status was analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 patients according to those stages preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 19 patients, nine (47.4%) showed improvement in the regional cerebral ischemic status, six (31.6%) showed no change, and four (21.1%) showed deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both improvement and no change in the regional cerebral ischemic status were regarded as effective, while deterioration was regarded as ineffective, meaning that 15 (78.9%) patients were effective and four (21.1%) patients were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effective rate for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (one of ten, 90.0%) was significantly higher than that for occlusive cerebrovascular disease (three of nine, 66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, only one patient (case N11) exhibited deterioration of symptoms, which presented as right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and no obvious changes in symptoms were observed for the other patients in the transient period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass is an effective and safe way to improve the regional cerebral perfusion and ischemic status in ischemic cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The stage based on the regional cerebral microcirculatory change and presentation of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="17677">CTP</z:chebi> can directly reflect the pathological mechanism underlying the regional cerebral ischemic status </plain></SENT>
