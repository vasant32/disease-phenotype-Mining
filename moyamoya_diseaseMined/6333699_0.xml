<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kr-81m single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomograms were superimposed on X-ray computed tomograms to assess topographically the perfusion of the entire brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Study of cerebrovascular diseases using this method showed: (1) regional cerebral blood flow change; (2) perfusion distribution change; (3) the route by which blood reached the brain or the obstructed artery proximal to the circle of Willis; (4) development of a collateral system and its actual function; and (5) efficacy of surgical bypass after extracranial-intracranial anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method is especially useful in hemodynamic assessment in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
