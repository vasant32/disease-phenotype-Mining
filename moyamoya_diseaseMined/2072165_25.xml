<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is, however, unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is an angiogenic factor as well as a potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> for a number of cell types including vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to test the possibility that basic FGF takes part in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the authors tested for the presence of this factor using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant basic FGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical specimens studied included two sections of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and four samples of dura mater from four patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surgical specimens were obtained from three patients with other diseases as control tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sections of the STA obtained from the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> showed strong basic FGF immunoreactivity in endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, while control sections had only faint and scattered immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sections of the dura mater obtained from the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> also revealed more intense immunohistochemical staining of basic FGF in meningeal and vascular cells than did control sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that the amount of basic FGF is increased in the tissues of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>; thus, basic FGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
