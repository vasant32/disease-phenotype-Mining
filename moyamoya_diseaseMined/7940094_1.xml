<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MRA was performed by the three-dimensional, time-of-flight technique and, successfully depicted the primary abnormalities in the distal carotid arteries in 10 out of the 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the other two patients, poor visualization of the intracranial vasculature strongly suggested the presence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On MRA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels were visible in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of anastomoses was also confirmed by MRA in seven of the 10 patients who had undergone encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that MRA may be the tool of choice for selecting patients to undergo conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, establishing a definite diagnosis still requires some improvements in the delineation of the fine vasculature </plain></SENT>
