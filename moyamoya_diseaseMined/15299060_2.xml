<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies using H(2)(15)O PET applied the bolus injection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is considerable discrepancy regarding the optimal time point of imaging after ACZ injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to continuously monitor cerebral blood flow (CBF) after ACZ using constant-infusion H(2)(15)O PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients with stenoses of an internal carotid artery and 6 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>H(2)(15)O was continuously infused, and data were recorded in 1-min frames </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After equilibration of H(2)(15)O, 5 min of baseline data were acquired, and then 1 g of ACZ was administered intravenously and data collection continued for 10-22 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood was continuously drawn for absolute quantification of CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The arterial (15)O concentration remained generally stable during scanning, and the cerebellar blood flow fluctuations of the 5 baseline scans were small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The scan-to-scan difference was 6% (difference of 2 successive scans/mean) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the nonpathologic areas, the increase in CBF started 1-2 min after administration of ACZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The largest fraction of the increase occurred from 0 to 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ratio of CBF in pathologic areas to CBF in cerebellum showed an initial decrease that stabilized after 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A continuous-infusion protocol is a viable alternative to single bolus injections for the assessment of cerebral perfusion status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such a protocol is advantageous when the time course of CBF after an intervention is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With continuous monitoring, the optimal time point for evaluation of a certain parameter can be chosen post hoc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the time course of CBF itself may allow the definition of new parameters for evaluating perfusion status in cerebrovascular patients, both for assessment before a revascularization procedure and for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of patients with each type of cerebrovascular disease and the lack of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
