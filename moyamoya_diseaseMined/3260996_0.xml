<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regional (r) CBF, rOEF, rCMRO2, rCBV in five cases of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease in children were studied with PET scan, using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> steady-state methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed ischemic symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e> and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intervals from the latest ictus to PET ranged from 3 days to 3 years 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control data were obtained through PET studies in 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters described above, in cerebral gray matter, white matter and basal ganglia were calculated and were carefully compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apparently low density area in X-ray CT were excluded from this analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although rCBF showed a little bit higher value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gray, white and basal ganglia, it was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>rCBV of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease significantly increased in gray, white and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The calculated value of CBF/CBV is considered to be an index of perfusion pressure and is the reversed value of transit time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This value was significantly decreased in "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease in every three region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> autoregulation, further decrease of perfusion pressure initiate increase of rOER and also decrease of rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In spite of reduction of CBF/CBV, rOER was not significantly increased in every three region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hence the cerebral circulation in children's "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" disease of ischemic type appears to be characterized by the mild decrease of perfusion pressure, dilated resistant vessels and prolonged circulation time </plain></SENT>
