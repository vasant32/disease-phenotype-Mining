<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The Japan Adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> Trial will determine whether the combination of EC-IC bypass with risk factor modifications affects the prognosis and the incidence of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct bypass such as superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis is essential and indirect bypass procedures alone such as encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis or encephalo-myo-synangiosis are not dealt with in this trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Power calculations are based on an assumption of alpha=0.05 with an annual event rate of 8% significant morbidity and mortality per year in the non-surgical group and 4% in the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study has an 80% rate of accuracy for detection of a 20% difference between the two groups in events in a 5-year follow up </plain></SENT>
