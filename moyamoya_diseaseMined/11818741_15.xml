<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 22 sides in 11 patients, we performed EDAS on 16 sides in 10 pa- tients, encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) on 5 sides in 4 patients and encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS) on 1 side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 patients, 8 patients showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and had no neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 patients showed mild to moderate neurological deficits, but in these cases, pre- and perioperative insults were considered to be attributable to the morbidities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 13 sides treated by EDAS, well-developed neovascularization was observed in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, well-developed neovascularization was observed in only 3 out of 6 sides treated by EMS or EDAMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data might indicate that EDAS is a therapeutic alternative for the surgical treatment of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
