<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients (1 male and 1 female; age 44 and 67 years, respectively) were found to have a vascular abnormality in which the main trunk of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> had a twig-like form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In these 2 patients, the abnormality was seen before the genu of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> inside the twigs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The twig appeared to be a network between the bifurcation of internal carotid artery and insular segment of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, and it was different from the collateral circulation due to acquired occlusion or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This new type of vascular lesion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> is not benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It appears to be associated with the occurrence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, an important clinical aspect </plain></SENT>
