<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this regard, we present a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> which was cured by concurrent multiple anastomotic procedures, namely superficial temporal artery (STA), middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis, encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) and encephalogaleosynangiosis (EGS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 24-year-old woman presented with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thorough investigation with MRA and MRI revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vasculopathy and was confirmed by cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple concurrent combined anastomotic procedures on both sides relieved the symptoms, which was also confirmed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Combination of multiple direct and indirect procedures covers the whole ischemic cortical area and provides effective neovascularization </plain></SENT>
