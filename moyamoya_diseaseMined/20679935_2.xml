<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> need revascularization in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory, there are few reports on direct bypass in the ACA territory because of the difficult surgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report our technical strategy for superficial temporal artery (STA)-ACA bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed simultaneous STA-ACA and STA-middle cerebral artery direct bypasses in 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> using the following strategies: creating 2 separate craniotomies for the 2 bypasses, dissecting a long STA graft and securing a recipient ACA around the bregma for the STA-ACA bypass, and using loose stitches at the anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One branch of the STA was dissected for a length of approximately 10 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The graft coursed on the brain surface under the bone bridge and was directly anastomosed to the cortical branch of the ACA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the anastomoses, the stitches were widely spaced and loose to facilitate expansion of the orifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: This method prevented kinking of the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiograms revealed good patency of the STA-ACA bypass in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the bypasses, 5 patients no longer had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 1 patient was almost completely free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and 1 patient had only residual contralateral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients, patency of the bypass was satisfactory during follow-up periods ranging from 9 to 23 months (mean 16.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This method of STA-ACA bypass provides successful and reliable direct revascularization of the ACA territory in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the possible merit of this surgery in improving cognitive function is warranted </plain></SENT>
