<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The indirect non-anastomotic bypass procedures for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are herein reviewed, and our multiple combined indirect procedure, i.e. a fronto-parieto-temporal combined indirect bypass procedure, is also introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Direct procedures such as superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis are able to form collaterals with a high reliability, but these procedures are often difficult to technically perform in small children, and complications, when they occur, tend to be severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indirect procedures, such as encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS), encephalo-myo-synangiosis (EMS), and encephalo-myo-arterio-synangiosis (EMAS) etc., are safe and easy and also successfully form collaterals especially in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there are a few drawbacks with such procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They do not always form sufficient collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area where the original EDAS using the posterior branch of the superficial temporal artery can be done is also limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because the area covered by each single procedure is small, the collateral formation obtained by a single procedure is not always satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For these reasons we developed a fronto-temporoparietal combined indirect bypass procedure for child patients in order to overcome these problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This multiple combined indirect procedure can cover a wider area of the ischemic brain through the EMAS in the frontal and the EDAS and EMS in the temporo-parietal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is also safe and easy to perform, and one or two of these three procedures form sufficient collaterals with a relatively high reliability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique is described and the results are presented </plain></SENT>
