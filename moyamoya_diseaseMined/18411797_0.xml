<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, three cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> in the operative field occurred just after opening of the dura mater and indirect anastomosis was performed as a substitute for direct anastomosis to terminate the operation earlier than originally planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> waked immediately from general anesthesia and showed no neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographay of the brain performed just after the operation showed no abnormalities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e>, and local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the three cases showed signs of having caught a cold before the operation, another manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0003193'>allergic rhinitis</z:hpo> just before the operation, and the other had taken a long walk and experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> a day before the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Abrupt return from hypocapnea to normocapnea during the induction of general anesthesia was thought to be the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was thought desirable that correction of hypocapnea needed to be performed gradually during the operation in those cases </plain></SENT>
