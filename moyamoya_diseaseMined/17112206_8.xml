<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2), regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF), and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the cortex of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territories and rCBV in the striatum were measured using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three subgroups according to type of disease manifestation and age: adult <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> type (five cases), adult ischemic type (10 cases), and childhood ischemic type (two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When compared with adult controls, statistically significant reductions in rCBF and rCMRO2, elevation in rOEF in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories, and elevation of rCBV in the striatum were observed in PET studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three subgroups </plain></SENT>
