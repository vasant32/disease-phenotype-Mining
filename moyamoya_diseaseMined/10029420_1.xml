<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study used BZD receptor imaging to evaluate neuronal damage in adult ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography and a novel tracer, 123I-iomazenil, were used to measure BZD receptor density in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of early and late images was performed in three asymptomatic, unoperated patients, and six mildly symptomatic, operated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Uptakes in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes of symptomatic patients were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than those of asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The late image/ early image count ratios (L/E ratios) of asymptomatic patients were relatively constant (mean, 0.571; range, 0.550-0.581) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the L/E ratios of symptomatic patients were not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The neuron density was preserved in adult asymptomatic patients despite harboring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the neuronal density was decreased in symptomatic patients even though their symptoms were mild and they had undergone revascularization </plain></SENT>
