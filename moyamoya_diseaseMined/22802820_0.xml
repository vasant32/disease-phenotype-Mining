<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is high in Asian countries; in Europe and North America, the prevalence of the disease is considerably lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the disease may be of ischaemic, haemorrhagic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Cognitive dysfunction</z:e> and behavioral disturbance are atypical symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>.Characteristic angiographic features of the disease include stenosis or occlusion of the arteries of the circle of Willis, as well as the development of collateral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently, magnetic resonance angiography and CT angiography with multi-row systems are the main imaging methods of diagnostics of the entire range of vascular changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>.The most common surgical treatment combines the direct arterial anastomosis between the superficial temporal artery and middle cerebral, and the indirect synangiosis involving placement of vascularised tissue in the brain cortex, in order to promote neoangiogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to progressive changes, correct and early diagnosis is of basic significance in selecting patients for surgery, which is the only effective treatment of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An appropriate qualification to surgery should be based on a comprehensive angiographic and imaging evaluation of brain structures.Despite the rare occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in European population, it should be considered as one of causes of ischaemic or haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, especially in young patients </plain></SENT>
