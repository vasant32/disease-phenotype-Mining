<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by means of single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) using the 133Xe inhalation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 11 children (21 hemispheres) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who were divided into two groups as follows, 1) Bypass group; who underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with other synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2) Non-Bypass group; who underwent only some synangiosis such as EDAS, EMAS, EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The summary of the results is shown below </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF (rCBF) after HV of the frontal lobes in the Non-Bypass group had an evident tendency to show low perfusion compared with CBF in other regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between low perfusion area after HV, and areas where the increase of rCBF is less after administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> became clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The strongest relation was observed between low perfusion after HV and re-build-up phenomenon on EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, rCBF after HV of the frontal lobes in the Bypass group had, compared with other regions, no tendency to show low perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From this study and our previous reports, it is assumed that there is some hemodynamic insufficiency in the frontal lobes of the Non-Bypass group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reason why the reduction of rCBF was less after HV especially in the frontal lobes of the Bypass group is still unknown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
