<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to delineate the long-term natural history of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted among 42 patients suffering from hemorrhagic MMD who had been treated conservatively without bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The group included four patients who had undergone indirect bypass surgery after an episode of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period averaged 80.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode and repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes were analyzed to determine the risk factors of rebleeding and poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>Intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was a dominant finding on computerized tomography scans during the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode in 29 cases (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 14 patients experienced a second episode of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, which occurred 10 years or longer after the original <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in five cases (35.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual rebleeding rate was 7.09%/person/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode was characterized by a change in which hemisphere <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred in three cases (21.4%) and by the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in seven cases (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After rebleeding the rate of good recovery fell from 45.5% to 21.4% and the mortality rate rose from 6.8% to 28.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding and patient age were statistically significant risk factors of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients in whom there was indirect revascularization after the second <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode experienced a repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode within 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of rebleeding a long time after the first hemorrhagic episode was not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the change in which hemisphere and the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> that occurred after the first episode suggested the difficulty encountered in the prevention of repeated <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
