<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The risk of basal ganglia <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (BGH) increases in patients of older age and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current guidelines do not recommend routine vascular imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, a proportion of patients with BGH have underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>, and these patients may require a different treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the proportion of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with BGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who presented with BGH between January 2007 and December 2009 at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following data were collected: patient demographics, vascular risk factors, medications, volume of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, CT scans, CT angiogram, magnetic resonance angiography and digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined the proportion of underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> and correlated these findings with risk factors for BGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A total of 113 consecutive patients with BGH were identified, and vascular imaging was performed in 61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median age was 62 years and 48 (78.7%) of these patients were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-two (68.9%) of 61 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive vascular imaging findings were identified in eight of 61 patients (13.1%): three <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo>, three cavernous malformations, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations between demographic features, vascular risk factors and the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> volume between patients with positive and negative vascular imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specifically, an underlying vascular abnormality was not associated with age (â‰¥ 60 years, 6/36 patients had an underlying vascular abnormality, compared with 2/25 patients&lt; 60 years; p=not significant [n.s.]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (5/42 hypertensive patients and 3/19 normotensive patients (n.s.) had an underlying vascular abnormality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We concluded that there is a significant proportion of relevant underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in patients with BGH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This likelihood is not predicted by risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate the importance of vascular imaging in patients with BGH who are not neurologically devastated </plain></SENT>
