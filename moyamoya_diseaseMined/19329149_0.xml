<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many modified surgical techniques for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been developed, and each of which has some advantages and disadvantages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the indication for one-stage extensive indirect vascular reconstructive surgery that is our original technique for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1 was a 3-year-old boy who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> involving the bilateral extremities and provoked by intense crying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a 5-year-old girl who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> involving the right extremities and provoked by intense crying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 3 was an 8-year-old girl who had frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> involving the bilateral extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 4 was a 3-year-old boy who had mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> due to bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but case 4, preoperative investigations demonstrated same-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case 4, preoperative investigations demonstrated different-stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progression of bilateral major <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent one-stage extensive indirect vascular reconstructive surgery of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative investigations revealed the development of rich neovascularization, disappearance of clinical symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We recommend one-stage extensive indirect vascular reconstructive surgery for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, particularly for patients younger than 5 years, when preoperative investigations reveal a same-stage case or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> progressive case </plain></SENT>
