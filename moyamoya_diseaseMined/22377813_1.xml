<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: RNF213 was recently reported as a susceptibility gene for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to clarify the correlation between the RNF213 genotype and MMD phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The entire coding region of the RNF213 gene was sequenced in 204 patients with MMD, and corresponding variants were checked in 62 pairs of parents, 13 mothers and 4 fathers of the patients, and 283 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical information was collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype correlations were statistically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The c.14576G&gt;A variant was identified in 95.1% of patients with familial MMD, 79.2% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> MMD, and 1.8% of controls, thus confirming its association with MMD, with an odds ratio of 259 and p &lt; 0.001 for either heterozygotes or homozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Homozygous c.14576G&gt;A was observed in 15 patients but not in the controls and unaffected parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate for homozygotes was calculated to be &gt;78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Homozygotes had a significantly earlier age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> compared with heterozygotes or <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp> (median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> 3, 7, and 8 years, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of homozygotes, 60% were diagnosed with MMD before age 4, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had infarctions as the first symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Infarctions at initial presentation and involvement of posterior cerebral arteries, both known as poor prognostic factors for MMD, were of significantly higher frequency in homozygotes than in heterozygotes and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild types</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Variants other than c.14576G&gt;A were not associated with clinical phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The homozygous c.14576G&gt;A variant in RNF213 could be a good DNA biomarker for predicting the severe type of MMD, for which early medical/surgical intervention is recommended, and may provide a better monitoring and prevention strategy </plain></SENT>
