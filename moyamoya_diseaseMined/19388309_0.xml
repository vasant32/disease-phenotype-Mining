<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis is a safe and effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion is a potential complication of this procedure, especially in adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Accurate diagnosis of postoperative hyperperfusion is important because its treatment is contradictory to that for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative techniques to detect hyperperfusion are still lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed intraoperative infrared (IR) brain surface monitoring in a 36-year-old man who underwent left STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: IR monitoring not only detected the patency of bypass, as also confirmed by conventional Doppler sonography and postoperative magnetic resonance angiography, but also delineated the local brain surface hemodynamics after revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of gradation value disclosed an abnormal increase in brain surface cerebral blood flow (indirectly indicated as a temperature change) after removal of the temporary clip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient suffered from transient right upper extremity numbness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> due to focal hyperperfusion from postoperative days 2 through 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intensive blood pressure control completely relieved his symptoms, and he was discharged without neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative brain surface monitoring by IR imaging may be useful to predict cerebral hyperperfusion after revascularization surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation with a larger number of patients is necessary to validate this technique </plain></SENT>
