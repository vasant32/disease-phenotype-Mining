<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are considered to have high risk of enlargement and rupture due to increased hemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct surgical intervention has been recommended for the treatment of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, but the direct approach to them is often difficult due to interference by intertwined abnormal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have performed direct surgery for seven major artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> located in the anterior circulation were successfully clipped via pterional or interhemispheric approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of four posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (two at the junction of the basilar artery and the superior cerebellar artery and two at the P1-P2 junction of the posterior cerebral artery), one was approached via pterional route because collateral vessels in the basal cistern was judged not to be rich on angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the operative field was interfered by abundant fragile collateral vessels and it was difficult to reach the distal portion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the other three cases in which the subtemporal approach was employed, there weren't any problems in exposures of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our experiences indicate that subtemporal approach is superior than the pterional approach to reach the distal portion of the basilar artery in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
