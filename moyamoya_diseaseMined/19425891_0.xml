<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion is a potential complication of this procedure, but its treatment is contradictory to that for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because intraoperative techniques to detect hyperperfusion are still lacking, the authors performed intraoperative infrared monitoring in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> using a novel infrared imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis in 25 patients (26 hemispheres) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, the authors monitored the brain surface temperature intraoperatively with the IRIS-V infrared imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average gradation value change (indicating temperature change) was calculated using commercial software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I]iodoamphetamine SPECT studies were performed routinely before and within 10 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patency of bypass, detailed local hemodynamics, and changes in cortical surface temperature around the anastomosis site were well recognized by the IRIS-V infrared imaging system in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present study, 10 patients suffered transient neurological symptoms accompanied by an increase in CBF around the anastomosis site, recognized as symptomatic hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increase in temperature was significantly higher in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensive blood pressure control was undertaken, and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavengers were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient in the present study suffered a permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the present method does not directly monitor surface CBF, temperature rise around the anastomosis site during surgery might be an indicator of postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prospective evaluation with a larger number of patients is necessary to validate this technique </plain></SENT>
