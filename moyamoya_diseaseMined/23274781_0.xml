<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study was designed to determine factors associated with SCH after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: /st&gt;Eighty-two adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients undergoing STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis between July 2005 and December 2010 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Laboratory data such as <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and white blood cell (WBC) count, preoperative (patient characteristic data, initial clinical manifestation, the angiographic staging), intraoperative (surgical time, the operative side, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> technique, fluid balance, arterial pressure, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the lowest haematocrit, and intraoperative transfusion), and postoperative (arterial pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>Physiology</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> Health Evaluation II score) data were collected and used as predictable factors for postoperative SCH, in which a focal intense increase in cerebral blood flow at the anastomosis site was shown in postoperative single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: /st&gt;Among 82 patients with 99 surgeries, 39 patients (47 sides, 47%) suffered from transient neurological deterioration due to SCH from 1 to 9 days after operation (median: 2 days), which was sustained for 1-14 days (median: 7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation on the dominant hemisphere [odds ratio (OR), 5.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.07-12.54, P&lt;0.001] was an independent risk factor for SCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, WBC count on postoperative day 1 was significantly correlated with SCH (OR 1.19; 95%CI, 1.02-1.38, P=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: /st&gt;The operation on the dominant hemisphere and increased postoperative WBC count may be associated with SCH after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
