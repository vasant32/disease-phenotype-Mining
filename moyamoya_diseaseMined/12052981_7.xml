<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We encountered several patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in whom the ipsilateral anterior and posterior circulations were predominantly involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether this is an angiographic characteristic of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated steno-occlusive lesions on angiograms of 85 patients with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, using two 4-stage angiographic classification scales for the internal carotid artery and posterior cerebral artery systems (ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> staging, respectively) and determined whether lesions with more advanced ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stages were on ipsilateral sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When positive laterality was defined as the presence of a difference by &gt; or =1 stage between the stages on both sides, lateralities in the ICA stages and in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stages were present in 40 (47%) and 27 patients (32%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions with more advanced ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stages were on the same side, with significant probability (P=0.024, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lateralities in both ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions were found in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 14 (82%) of the 17 patients, the more advanced side of ICA lesions was the same as that of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions, while it was contralateral in 3 patients (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, asymmetrical involvement of bilateral ICAs and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi> was common, and the ipsilateral ICA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> tended to be predominantly involved </plain></SENT>
