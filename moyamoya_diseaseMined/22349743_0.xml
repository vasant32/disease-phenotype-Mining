<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four years previously, he had been diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) by cerebral magnetic resonance imaging/angiography findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In MMD, risk factors for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> include changes in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, blood pressure, and body temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), these hemodynamic changes can be challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> during CPB can decrease cerebral oxygen consumption and have a cerebral protective effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We performed a minimally invasive mitral valve plasty, using hypothermic CPB, in a patient with MMD, without any neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
