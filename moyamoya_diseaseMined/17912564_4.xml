<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated meningeal cellularity and VEGF expression in dura mater of patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine dural specimens from nine cerebral hemispheres of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and four control dural specimens from four non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients were collected during surgery and investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dural specimens were immunohistochemically stained with VEGF antibody, and then meningeal cellularity and VEGF expression in dural tissue were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean+/-standard error (SE) of total number of meningeal cells (meningeal cellularity) in dural tissue was 21.5+/-3.0 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients, whereas it was 2.7+/-0.7 in control patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The meningeal cellularity and VEGF expression were statistically significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> group in comparison to control group (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meningeal cellularity and VEGF expression are significantly increased in dura mater of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
