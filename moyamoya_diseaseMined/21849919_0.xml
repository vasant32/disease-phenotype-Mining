<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Adults with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) have been shown to manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, but it is unclear whether this is the result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adults with MMD but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed detailed neuropsychological assessments in 30 adults with angiographically confirmed MMD without magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients (67%) exhibited small T2 hyperintensities in the cerebral subcortical white matter on brain MRI but no evidence of gray matter damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, defined as half of test scores â‰¥ 1 SD below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean, was present in 7 patients (23%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Executive functioning, mental efficiency, and word finding were the ability areas most frequently impaired, whereas memory was relatively intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700361" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional distress</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>) was present in 11 patients (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparable cognitive findings were also observed in the subset of 10 patients (33%) with completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> static brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in MMD can occur in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> as manifested on MRI </plain></SENT>
