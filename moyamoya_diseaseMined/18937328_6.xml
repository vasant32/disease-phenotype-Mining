<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>Craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> is a benign <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> that can be treated with some combination of surgery, intracystic chemotherapy and radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath>, especially radiation therapy, is associated with a variety of long-term toxicities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> seen in the children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> who received radiation therapy at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We reviewed our experience with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> patients who received radiation therapy from 1995 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical data including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and imaging for vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty of the 22 children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> who received radiation therapy had imaging available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of the 20 were found to have some type of vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One had bilateral temporal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernomas</z:e>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, one had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the internal carotid artery and three children had decreases in the caliber of the carotid or cerebral arteries, but were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the six children with abnormalities also received intracystic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> prior to radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We report a high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> in children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_257'>craniopharyngioma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that intracystic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> may contribute to radiation-related vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We now include magnetic resonance angiography as part of our routine follow up in these children </plain></SENT>
