<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Therapy with intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30050">colloidal gold</z:chebi> has been used in the past as an adjunct in the treatment of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the long-term follow-up period of a series of patients treated with intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30050">colloidal gold</z:chebi> and emphasize the high incidence of delayed cerebrovascular complications and their management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1967 and 1970, 14 children with posterior fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> underwent treatment at the University of Minnesota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of surgical resection, external beam radiotherapy, and intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30050">colloidal gold</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent long-term follow-up periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 14 original patients, 6 died within 2 years of treatment; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experienced persistent or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The eight surviving patients developed significant neurovascular complications 5 to 20 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients died as a result of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and five developed ischemic symptoms from severe vasculopathy that resembled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30050">colloidal gold</z:chebi> resulted in long-term survival in a number of cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo>, our experience suggests that the severe cerebrovascular side effects fail to justify its use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The unique complications associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30050">colloidal gold</z:chebi> therapy, as well as the management of these complications, are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend routine screening of any long-term survivors to exclude the presence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> and to document the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
