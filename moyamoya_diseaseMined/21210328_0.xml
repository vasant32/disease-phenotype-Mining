<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A young adult presented limb-<z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The magnetic resonance angiography proved the steno-occlusive lesions in the major arteries of circle of Willis, and the magnetic resonance images demonstrated compensatively congested and dilated leptomeningeal vessels and lenticulostriate arteries with exhausted vasomotor elasticity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this case, without the aid of conventional angiography, the noninvasive magnetic resonance studies offered explicit imaging evidence to support the diagnosis and to illuminate the patient's clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
