<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each set of embryonic arteries can be a potential source of these vascular networks which reconstitute the distal flows in segmental <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of internal carotid or vertebral arteries especially in patients with PHACE (posterior fossa malformation of the brain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangiomas</z:hpo>, arterial anomalies, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac anomalies</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>coarctation of aorta</z:hpo>, and eye abnormalities) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic rete mirabile has been found in some mammals such as camel, deer and avian species of pigeon, Hawaiian seabirds and deep-water fish of the cod other than human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe the first human case of ophthalmic rete mirabile confirmed on angiography in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are the first description in the English literature as far as we know </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> will be briefly discussed according to the embryologic development of cranial arteries </plain></SENT>
