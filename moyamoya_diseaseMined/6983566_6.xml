<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In HLA-A, -B, -C stereotyping, an association was found of AW24, BW46, and BW54 with relative risks of 3.83, 6.50, and 3.58 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natural T cell toxic autoantibody was detected by FACS analysis in sera from five out of 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Millipore filter assay for autoantibody against <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> revealed higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> binding in sera from four out of 18 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-vessel antibody which might be responsible for vascular change associated with moya-moya was not detected in any of the 23 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant association of the disease with certain HLA types, in addition to the presence of natural T cell toxic autoantibody and anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4705">double-stranded DNA</z:chebi> antibody in patients' sera, supports the theory that genetic and immunologic disturbances may underly the pathogenesis of moya-moya </plain></SENT>
