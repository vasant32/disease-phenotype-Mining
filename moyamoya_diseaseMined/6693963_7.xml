<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) has revealed that most of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> found in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is intracerebral or intraventricular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors have reviewed 54 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> confirmed by CT, including nine of their own, and found that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was intracerebral or intraventricular </plain></SENT>
