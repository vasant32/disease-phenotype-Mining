<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Determining the presence and adequacy of collateral blood flow is important in cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we explored whether a noninvasive imaging modality, arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, could be used to detect the presence and intensity of collateral flow using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT cerebral blood flow as gold standards for collaterals and cerebral blood flow, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ASL and DSA were obtained within 4 days of each other in 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two neurointerventionalists scored DSA images using a collateral grading scale in regions of interest corresponding to ASPECTS methodology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two neuroradiologists similarly scored ASL images based on the presence of arterial transit artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Agreement of ASL and DSA consensus scores was determined, including kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients, additional quantitative <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT cerebral blood flow measurements were performed and compared with collateral grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The agreement between ASL and DSA consensus readings was moderate to strong, with a weighted kappa value of 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.64), but there was better agreement between readers for ASL compared with DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity and specificity for identifying collaterals with ASL were 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.88) and 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.87), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> CT cerebral blood flow increased with increasing DSA and ASL collateral grade (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ASL can noninvasively predict the presence and intensity of collateral flow in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> using DSA as a gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other cerebrovascular diseases</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, is warranted </plain></SENT>
