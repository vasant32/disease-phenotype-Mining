<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 30 patients with this disease, comparing MRI and angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic value of MRI was evaluated for occlusive lesions, collateral vessels, and parenchymal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients bilateral occlusion or stenosis of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries was clearly shown by MRI, and staging of the extent of occlusion agreed with angiographic staging in 44 (73%) of 60 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI, particularly coronal images, clearly showed basal cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in 54 hemispheres, and 45 of a total of 71 large leptomeningeal and transdural collateral vessels were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI also showed parenchymal lesions in 48 (80%) hemispheres, and the extent of occlusion in the anterior and posterior circulations respectively correlated with white matter and cortical and/or subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
