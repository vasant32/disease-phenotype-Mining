<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTS: Some cases of unilateral involvement have angiographic findings on the affected side which resemble those of definite cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed these cases to determine whether the entity "unilateral MMD" actually exists and whether unilateral involvement represents only the early phase of the pathologic process found in definitive bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1988 and 2000, seven cases of unilateral MMD were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The male-to-female ratio was 2:5, mean age was 5.1 years (7 months to 8 years), and mean follow-up duration was 64.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms of these cases were similar to those of definite MMD, and no familial occurrence was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the seven unilateral MMD cases showed progression to bilateral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the remaining cases showed no evidence of contralateral progression during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of unilateral MMD seem to be an unusual form of stenoocclusive process of the proximal intracranial arteries, distinguishing the condition from definite MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment on the symptomatic side and close observation for signs of bilateral involvement are necessary </plain></SENT>
