<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, either by direct anastomosis or indirect procedures, is an accepted and effective form of treatment for prevention of future ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indirect procedures do not provide sufficient collateral vessels in a subset of patients, who then have persistent or new symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat revascularization procedures may be recommended for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients underwent repeat revascularization after undergoing an indirect procedure in the same hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were included in the study, and a retrospective review of their clinical details, neuroimaging results, surgical details, and outcome was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct revascularization was the procedure of choice; however, in patients with no acceptable recipient vessel (&gt; 0.6 mm) the authors added a second indirect procedure for further revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the last 19 years, 16 patients (8 male and 8 female patients, age range 5-48 years, mean 16.7 years, 10 pediatric and 6 adult patients) underwent repeat revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initially <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients presented with ischemic symptoms (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> [<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>] and 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; 2 patients had bilateral symptoms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed that 13 patients had bilateral disease, and 3 had unilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial surgery was bilateral encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) in 9, unilateral EDAS alone in 3, unilateral EDAS with contralateral superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass in 2, bilateral encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) in 1, and unilateral EMS in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 16 patients continued to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in the hemisphere ipsilateral to surgery, whereas 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679466" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive deficit</z:e>, 1 had asymptomatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, and 1 had visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Poor revascularization was seen on angiography studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median duration between the surgeries was 24 months (3 months-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Repeat revascularization was performed in 23 hemispheres (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Direct revascularization was performed in 14 hemispheres (60.9%): STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass in 10, external carotid artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vein bypass in 2, occipital artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>)-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 1, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>-posterior cerebral artery in 1 hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Indirect revascularization was performed for patients without an acceptable recipient vessel, and was done in 9 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The procedures included EMS (4 hemispheres), repeat EDAS (2), and omental transposition (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was 1 postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in a patient undergoing a high-flow vein graft implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>None of the other patients experienced any neurological worsening after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, ranging from 3 to 144 months (mean 34 months, median 12 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients who survived repeat revascularization surgery, 12 (80%) were free from any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or any other neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Two patients had occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, less frequent than before, whereas 1 patient had frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and underwent revision of the revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies were available in 11 patients, and showed improved flow in the hemispheres in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging performed at 6 months did not reveal a new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeat revascularization procedures are effective for patients who are clinically symptomatic and have inadequate collateral vessels following indirect procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although direct procedures are preferred, the choice of procedure depends on the operative findings and the status of donor and recipient vessels </plain></SENT>
