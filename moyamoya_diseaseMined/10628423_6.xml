<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tried to investigate if magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging can be used as a routine brain screening examination instead of spin-echo T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and ninety-four patients with clinically suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain diseases</z:e> were randomly selected and examined with both brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> FLAIR and T2-weighted imaging on the axial plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two imaging techniques were evaluated by two neuroradiologists as to which imaging was better for routine brain T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 123 of 394 cases (31%), FLAIR imaging was superior to spin-echo T2-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Especially in cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory diseases</z:e>, traumatic diseases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011303" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">demyelinating diseases</z:e>, FLAIR imaging was particularly useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small lesions bordering cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are often detected only by FLAIR imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 259 cases (66%), including 147 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cases (37%), they were equally evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only in 12 cases (3%) was conventional T2-weighted imaging superior to FLAIR imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular lesions like <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> could not be detected on FLAIR images because these structures were obscured by a low signal from the CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, because old infarctions tend to appear as low signal intensity on FLAIR images, the condition was sometimes hard to detect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, FLAIR imaging could be used as routine brain T2-weighted imaging instead of conventional spin-echo T2-weighted imaging if these vascular lesions were watched </plain></SENT>
