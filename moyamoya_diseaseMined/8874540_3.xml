<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Use of the omentum in the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is now widely accepted, and, especially in patients with ischemic symptoms of anterior or posterior cerebral artery distribution, omental transplantation or other indirect revascularizations are indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old man, who developed left homonymous hemianopia, was discovered to have occlusion of the distal portion of bilateral internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed indirect revascularization with an omental flap on the left cerebral hemisphere and a serratus anterior muscle flap on the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Subsequent clinical course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow study and angiography revealed good collateral circulation in both the omentum and muscle flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The collateral circulation was more developed than that arising from the omental transfer on the contralateral side at the same postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This type of encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS)-EMS with free muscle flap-is as effective as that with the omental flap in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially in a patient who is in need of vascular reconstruction of an extensive ischemic area, serratus anterior muscle flap transfer is one of the alternative methods </plain></SENT>
