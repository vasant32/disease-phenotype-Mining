<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old man with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> with misery perfusion in the right cerebral hemisphere underwent double right superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery bypasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful until the patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and agitated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> on the 4th postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Perfusion computed tomographic imaging demonstrated hyperperfusion in the right temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The symptoms resolved by institution of intensive blood pressure control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography performed 2 months after surgery demonstrated a postoperative reduction of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in the right temporal lobe, where brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was observed on magnetic resonance images 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychological testing performed 3 months postoperatively showed worsening digit span, which adversely affected the patient's quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The current case suggests that cerebral hyperperfusion after vascular reconstructive surgery can cause irreversible neural damage, which results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
