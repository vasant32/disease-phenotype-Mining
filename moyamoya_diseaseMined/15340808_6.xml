<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We describe the actual state of ruptured de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> to contribute to a guideline of follow-up for the patients with treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively investigated 12 cases drawn from 483 consecutive cases of aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> at our institute over a period of 22 years, in which a previously undemonstrated (hence "de novo") intracranial saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formed and ruptured after successful treatment of a prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The 12 cases constitute 2.5% of the 483 patients who left our hospital alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were females and one was a male with a mean age of 55.7 years (range 29-75) at the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and an interval between the first and the second rupture of 10.7 years (range: 2.6-23.8, standard deviation: 6.86, 95% confidence interval: 6.39-15.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four cases did not have risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, family history, smoking, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of these ruptured de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was at the same location as the original lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-third (4 cases) of the de novo lesions in our series were found on the opposite side to each prior lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: For not only young but also elder patients with a treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (from the fifth decade to the sixth), especially for women, late angiography or alternative modalities of less-invasive examination should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To detect de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> before rupture, the search for a de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should be performed within 6.39 years after a previous examination that shows an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to be nonexistent, in view of the 95% confidence interval of the mean time to de novo aneurysmal rupture (6.39-15.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If applied this survey, 75% (8 cases of 12 cases) of our de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> would be detected before rupture </plain></SENT>
