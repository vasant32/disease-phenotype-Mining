<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> is known as a rare complication after revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, although its underlying mechanism is undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> attack and postoperative alteration in CBF in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF was routinely measured by N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[123I] iodpamphetamine (123I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT) 1 and 7 days after superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis on 64 sides of the 44 consecutive patients (male:female = 13:31, 2-62 years old) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients (male:female = 1:2, 40-55 years old) suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> attack at 1 to 10 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients manifested as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> at 8-10 days after surgery and presented transient neurologic deteriolation before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative SPECT revealed significant increase in CBF at the sites of the anastomosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed no ischemic changes, and magnetic resonance angiography showed the apparently patent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis as thick high signal intensity sign in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anatomical location and the temporal profile of hyperperfusion were completely in accordance with the focus of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intensive blood pressure control and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> agents were instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neurologic deficits were resolved and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> attack recurred in three patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> attacks occur, routine CBF measurement is recommended to differentiate hyperperfusion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, since the treatments for these conditions are contradictory </plain></SENT>
