<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors have previously reported an association between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and several alleles for human leukocyte antigens (HLA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further specify the genetic component of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, a linkage study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> using markers on chromosome 6, where the HLA gene is located, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 15 microsatellite markers of chromosome 6 were studied in 20 affected sibling pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From an identical-by-descent analysis of these markers, an allele with possible linkage to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sharing of the allele among affected members in 19 families was investigated, considering the haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The marker, D6S441, might be linked to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Considering the haplotype, the allele was shared among the affected members in 16 (82%) of the 19 families, but not in two others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one family, sharing of the allele could not be determined because of low heterozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to clarify multiple genetic factors that are definitely linked with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
