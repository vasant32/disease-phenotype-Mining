<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated in this study whether SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis involved in neovascularization in patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen patients with MMD and twelve healthy individuals were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with MMD detected by cerebral angiography were retrieved from the Nanjing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral whole blood cells were double stained with anti-CD34 and anti-CXCR4 (CD184) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numbers of CD34(+) CXCR4(+) cells were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentration of SDF-1α was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In consecutive patients with MMD, the number of CD34(+) CXCR4(+) cells was greater than healthy individuals (54.1 ± 28.6/μl peripheral blood (PB) versus 24.6 ± 25.6/μl PB; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma SDF-1α level was significantly higher in patients with MMD compared with healthy controls (1676.76 ± 198.65 pg/ml versus 1508.26 ± 137.27 pg/ml; P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation between number of CD34(+) CXCR4(+) cells and plasma SDF-1α level in the patients with MMD was observed (r = 0.185; P = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicated that increased levels of circulating SDF-1α and CD34(+) CXCR4(+) cells in patients with MMD, which may play an important role in the vasculogenesis in MMD </plain></SENT>
