<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to monitor hemodynamic changes caused by bypass surgery for postoperative management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the bypass blood flow during STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) fluorescence angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We evaluated the bypass blood flow in 13 MD and 21 non-MD patients during STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis by means of ICG angiography with injection of ICG into the anastomosed STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ICG perfusion area was calculated when the ICG fluorescence intensity reached maximum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured cortical oxygen saturation before anastomosis by means of visual light spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICG angiography demonstrated bypass blood flow from the anastomosed STA to the cortical vessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ICG perfusion area in MD (20.7 ± 6.6 cm(2)) was significantly larger than that in non-MD (8.4 ± 9.1 cm(2), P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cortical oxygen saturation (58.9% ± 8.3%) in MD was significantly lower than that in non-MD (73.4% ± 9.5%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICG angiography with injection of ICG into the bypass artery allowed quantitative assessment of bypass blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The bypass supplies blood flow to a greater extent in MD than in non-MD during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This might be caused by a larger pressure gradient between the anastomosed STA and recipient vessels in MD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that MD requires careful control of systemic blood pressure after surgery to avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611713" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ICG angiography is considered useful for facilitating safe and accurate bypass surgery and providing information for postoperative management </plain></SENT>
