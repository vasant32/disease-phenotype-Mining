<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> video-angiography (ICGA) is an excellent method to assess vessels during cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Objective: The aim of the present study is to analyze the effectiveness of ICGA in patients undergoing STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective review of case records and operation records of patients who underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> at our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concordance of ICGA with intraoperative micro-Doppler and postoperative angiography, whenever available, was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 22 STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses were performed in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ICGA was used to assess patency in 14 surgeries (10 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient required revision of anastomosis following ICGA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography was done in five anastomoses (three patients) at three months follow-up and correlated well with ICGA findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: ICGA is an effective technique to assess bypass patency during cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Routine use of ICGA in cerebral bypass surgery improves graft patency and minimizes complications due to graft occlusion </plain></SENT>
