<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An unusual vascular network is formed as a result of ischemic change of cerebrovascular system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although some investigations suggested possible etiological factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, the etiology is still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the genetic factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, class II genes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) were analyzed at the DNA level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DNA typing of HLA was performed in the unrelated Japanese patients with definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> using extracted genomic DNA from the leukocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The genotype was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (PCR-SSOP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The class II genotypes were analyzed in 71 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, several alleles of class II genes showed significant association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DQB1*0502 had positive association with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand DRB1*0405 and DQB1*0401 had negative association </plain></SENT>
