<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report on four patients with a rare combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100647'>Graves disease</z:hpo>-associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> and MMD, whose cerebrovascular ischemic events occurred while in a thyrotoxic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical correlation between MMD and Graves' <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e>, and outcome after surgical intervention are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four young women, ages 22 to 25 years, presented with profound cerebrovascular ischemic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They had clinical and radiological features consistent with the diagnosis of MMD and were in the active thyrotoxic state of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100647'>Graves disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To prevent a future ischemic event, patients underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis combined with encephalomyosynangiosis or encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis after normalization of their hormonal conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients have been neurologically stable since revascularization procedures and lead a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with MMD, cerebrovascular ischemic events may be precipitated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One possible pathomechanism of cerebrovascular ischemic aggravation in the thyrotoxic state may be a hemodynamic compromise induced by an excessive increase in the cerebral metabolism and oxygen demand over the compensation of the cerebral blood flow deficit through collateral supply in MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical revascularization after optimal control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyrotoxicosis</z:e> is thought to be an appropriate treatment in patients with MMD concurrent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100647'>Graves disease</z:hpo> for the prevention of further ischemic events, especially in those with impaired cerebral perfusion and cerebral ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
