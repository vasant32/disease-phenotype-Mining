<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: BOLD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging combined with a technique for precision control of end-tidal pCO(2) was used to produce quantitative maps of CVR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique was validated against measures of disease severity by using conventional angiography; it then was used to study the relationship between CVR, vascular steal, and disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis comparing conventional angiography with BOLD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed on 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Iso-oxic cycling of end-tidal pCO(2) between 2 target values was performed during BOLD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVR was calculated as the BOLD signal difference per Delta pCO(2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CVR was correlated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> or pial collaterals and the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> as graded by using a modified Suzuki score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A good correlation between mean CVR and Suzuki score was found for the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA territories (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.7560 and -0.6140, respectively; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar correlation was found between mean CVR and the presence of pial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> collateral vessels for combined <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ACA territories (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.7466; P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On a voxel-for-voxel basis, there was a greater extent of steal within vascular territories with increasing disease severity (higher modified Suzuki score) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean CVR was found to scale nonlinearly with the extent of vascular steal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative measures of CVR show direct correlation with impaired vascular supply as measured by the modified Suzuki score and enable direct investigation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of autoregulatory reserve, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e>, within a given vascular territory </plain></SENT>
