<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> is an uncommon but well-recognized entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment remains variable, ranging from observation to intervention using either surgical or endovascular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> along the lenticulostriate artery have been reported in only 41 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current case study illustrates the effectiveness of observation in the context of a dissecting lenticulostriate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and discusses other approaches that have been used in the treatment of this particular entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL SUMMARY: An Accomplished Mountain Climber presented, following coitus, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, mild facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>forgetfulness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vascular imaging studies revealed a right putaminal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> secondary to a 3 mm lenticulostriate artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the patient did well, with marked improvement in presenting symptoms enabling his return to mountain climbing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow up angiography showed spontaneous resolution of the arterial dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 41 reported cases, 19 were idiopathic, 5 associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and 17 related to various conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, intraventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 42 cases, including the present case, 28 were surgically or endovascularly managed and 12 observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one of the reported cases, a 33 year old male with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, who was managed conservatively, died of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no common consensus in literature on a single treatment strategy for a lenticulostriate artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present case illustrates that observation and follow up vascular imaging can be an important treatment strategy allowing healing of the vessel wall and disappearance of the dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
