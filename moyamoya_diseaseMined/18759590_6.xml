<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors describe their minimally invasive technique for performing a superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass, which relies on an enlarged bur hole (2-2.5 cm) rather than the standard craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They perform this procedure in a minimally invasive fashion, using CT angiography for intraoperative neuronavigation as well as for preoperative identification of the donor and recipient vessels and planning of bur hole location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They present 2 cases in which this procedure was used, including one involving a patient with multivessel occlusive disease and significant cerebrovascular hemodynamic compromise in whom they performed the procedure using only <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation in order to minimize the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anesthetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive literature search revealed no previously published case of an extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass procedure performed in an awake patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors have adopted the described minimally invasive method for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The awake setting, however, is reserved for specific indications, primarily patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, in whom ventilator-related hypocarbia can result in intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, or patients with multivessel occlusive disease and significant cerebral hemodynamic compromise, in whom general anesthesia-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> can lead to intraoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
