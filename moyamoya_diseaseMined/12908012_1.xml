<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histological changes of duplication of the internal elastic lamina could be seen mainly in the terminal portion of the ICA in the animals injected with rod-shaped LGA-50 containing MDP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No angiographic changes were seen in any of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the immunological reaction induced by MDP caused histological changes in the intima of the ICA similar to those observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This experimental study, however, could not clarify the development of the basal collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
