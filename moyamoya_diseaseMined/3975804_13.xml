<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient did not have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> but had an ischemic attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, located on the proximal portion of the lateral posterior choroidal artery, disappeared after external carotid-internal carotid anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> are briefly reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We emphasize that the treatment of choice in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is cerebral revascularization, because it reduces the increased blood flow through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels, basilar artery and other uninvolved cerebral arteries, the sites where the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in this disease frequently develop, as the blood flow through the external carotid system is increased by such an operation </plain></SENT>
