<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 2002 to March 2008, 18 patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (12 males and 6 females) were treated, aged 9 to 33 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, including 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to Chinese ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> evaluation tools, 17 patients were classified as low risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and 1 as moderate risk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different levels of occlusion branch of the intracranial carotid arteries and pathosis collaterals were identified by DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients and 4 patients were showed unilateral and bilateral hypoperfusion of cerebral blood flow by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients received superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and 7 patients received medicine (anti-PLT agglutinin and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> incisions healed at stage I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events during perioperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anastomosis vessel vasospasm occurred in 2 patients 5 days after operation; and hyperperfusion syndrome in 1 patient 2 weeks after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed up 13-32 months (mean 18 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 11 anastomosis patients, 6 underwent 6 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events within 12 months; in 7 medicine patients, 6 underwent 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events within 12 months; and showing a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence rate was 85.7% in medicine patients and 54.5% in anastomosis patients 12 months after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DSA showed pathosis collaterals in 7 anastomosis patients and 6 medicine patients 6 months after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After 12 months according to modified Rankin scale, the scores of anastomosis patients were 3 points in 1 case, 2 points in 6 cases and 0-1 point in 4 cases, and the scores of medicine patients were 2 points in 2 cases and 0-1 point in 5 cases; showing no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As long as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred and ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is diagnosed, one-stage direct revascularization should be performed, which can reduce the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence risk and slow down the progression of disease </plain></SENT>
