<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because they are not visible by routine chromosome analysis, high resolution whole-genome technologies are required for the detection and diagnosis of small chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) have been useful tools for the identification and mapping of deletions and duplications at higher resolution and throughput </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report here on the clinical and molecular analysis of a 10-year-old girl with SMS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (occlusion of the circle of Willis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have employed a combination of aCGH, FISH, and MLPA to characterize an approximately 6.3 Mb deletion spanning chromosome region 17p11.2-p13.1 in this patient, with the proximal breakpoint within the RAI1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, investigation of the genomic architecture at the breakpoint intervals of this large deletion documented the presence of palindromic repeat elements that could potentially form recombination substrates leading to unequal crossover </plain></SENT>
