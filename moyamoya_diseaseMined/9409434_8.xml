<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying intracranial rebleeding is not well elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 15 patients who bled two times or more among 46 bled patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that there were two different types in the manner of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One group consisted of seven cases, which bled two times or more at the same site than the original <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four of these seven cases, a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was identified at the distal part of collateral vessel or on the major vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other three cases, no source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases, rebleeding occurred within 2 months after the initial insult except for one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another group consisted of eight cases, which bled repeatedly but at different sites from the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In any of these cases, neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> nor other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these cases, rebleeding occurred more than 2 months after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present result indicated that <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> might occur as a result of rupture of a tiny <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the periphery of collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be blown out after initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When they persist after the event, they may rupture again in a fairly short interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In other cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occur at different sites from the initial site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They are considered to be a result of ruptured weak <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels which are forced to act as collateral pathways and are under unusually increased hemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
