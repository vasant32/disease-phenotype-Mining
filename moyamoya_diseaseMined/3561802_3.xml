<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also present the data from the 763 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> obtained in the cooperative studies which were supported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan, and discussed the epidemiological and clinicopathological aspects in relation to those reported in the literature </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It should be stressed also from our experiences that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kinds of vascular malformation, either intracranial or intraspinal, bleed probably more often than we expect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgeons should pay more careful attention to these vascular malformations with appropriate concepts of the disease </plain></SENT>
