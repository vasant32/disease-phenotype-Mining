<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow velocity and diameter of the operated STA on duplex ultrasonography (STDU), as well as regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) on single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) were measured before, 14days after, and 3months after EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postsurgical changes in the ipsilateral STA mean flow velocity (MFV) were significantly higher (p=0.0030) and those in the rCBF in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory were relatively higher (p=0.0936) in the M-group than the A-group patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On 14days after EC-IC bypass, the STA MFV (76.0±22.5 vs 55.2±16.5cm/s, p=0.0006) and the rCBF (40.0±8.0 vs 34.2±5.9ml/100g/min, p=0.0065) were significantly higher in the M-group than in the A-group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On 3months after EC-IC bypass, these differences in the STA MFV or the rCBF disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the postsurgical STA diameter and the ACZ reactivity between both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in the STA MFV as well as the rCBF were higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> than atherothrombotic carotid occlusive disease in the early phase after EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The STA MFV is highly correlated with the rCBF after EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
