<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 24 supraclinoid internal carotid arteries studied, 21 arteries (88%) were accurately evaluated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and in three arteries the extent of occlusive disease was overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 72 large branch basal cerebral vessels, including the bilateral anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries, 61 arteries (85%) were accurately evaluated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and in 11 arteries the extent of occlusive disease was overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While conventional arteriography showed basal cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 24 hemispheres, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in 20 of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 28 large leptomeningeal and transdural collateral vessels, 18 were identified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the one surgical collateral vessel evaluated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography successfully showed its patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography may have value in following disease progression and, perhaps, in evaluation of surgical bypass patency </plain></SENT>
