<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The object of this study was to report the clinical features, surgical treatment, and long-term outcomes in adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> treated at a single institution in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age 40 +/- 11 years [SD], range 18-69 years) were treated with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologists examined patients pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was obtained in person or by structured telephone interview (median 41 months, range 4-126 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following outcomes were collected: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), infarction, graft collateralization, change in cerebral perfusion, and functional level according to the modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates of infarction risk were calculated for comparison of surgically treated and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of patients were women (65%), were Caucasian (65%), presented with ischemic symptoms (98%), and had bilateral disease (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients underwent unilateral and 24 patients bilateral EDAS (67 treated hemispheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collateral vessels developed in 50 (98%) of 52 hemispheres for which imaging was available and there was evidence of increased perfusion on SPECT scans in 41 (82%) of the 50 hemispheres evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural infarction (&lt; 48 hours) occurred in 3% of the hemispheres treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up period patients experienced 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, 6 infarctions, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the hemisphere selected for surgery was based upon patients' symptoms and severity of pathology, the 5-year infarction-free survival rate was 94% in the surgically treated hemispheres versus &lt; 36% in the untreated hemispheres (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age and sex, infarction was 89% less likely to occur in the surgically treated hemispheres than in the contralateral hemispheres (hazard ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight (88%) of 43 patients had preserved or improved mRS scores, relative to baseline status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this mixed-race population of North American patients, indirect bypass promoted adequate pial collateral development and increased perfusion in the majority of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients had low rates of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, infarction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and the majority of patients had preserved or improved functional status </plain></SENT>
