<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently found that cultured smooth muscle cells (SMC) derived from arteries of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> responded poorly to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, especially to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated further the binding and processing of 125I-PDGF, as well as down-regulation of the PDGF receptor in arterial SMC derived from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The specific binding sites of 125I-PDGF were reduced significantly at both 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C on SMC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> compared with those from control (4.78 vs. 11.92 x 10(4)/cell at 4 degrees C), though the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) were the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kinetics of 125I-PDGF binding at 37 degrees C in cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> showed fewer binding sites (less than 1/3 of controls) and lower degradation per cell than in those from controls, though no difference was observed in either internalization or degradation of each receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When SMC were exposed to lower concentrations of nonlabeled PDGF at 37 degrees C, the percentage of remaining binding sites on cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was significantly less than that from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This excess down-regulation of PDGF receptor in SMC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may be interpreted as insufficient recycling or a decreased intracellular pool of the PDGF receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are closely correlated with the diminished proliferation responses to PDGF in SMC from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and provide evidence that functional alterations in vascular cells are involved in the mechanism of development of intimal thickening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
