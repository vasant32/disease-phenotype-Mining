<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of different bypass procedures on postoperative neovascularization in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> at Hiroshima University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen cerebral hemispheres of seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the 14 hemispheres underwent direct bypass surgery and the remaining 9 underwent indirect bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neovascularization after bypass surgery was evaluated by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of angiographic neovascularization after direct or indirect bypass surgery was graded as good, fair or poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neovascularization status (good, fair or poor) was compared with the bypass procedure (direct and indirect bypass) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good neovascularization was observed in 8 hemispheres and the remaining 6 had poor neovascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Direct bypass surgery was significantly more effective for angiographic neovascularization than the indirect procedure in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients (chi2-test, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we concluded that the direct bypass procedure is a better choice for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> as evidenced by angiographic neovascularization </plain></SENT>
