<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the degree of hemodynamic stress in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusive cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> can be quantitatively evaluated with the use of perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (mean age, 26.8 years; range, 18 to 59) underwent PWI and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) within a month's interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PWI data were calculated by three different analytic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow (CBF) ratio, cerebral blood volume (CBV) ratio, and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) of the anterior circulation were calculated using the cerebellum as a control region and compared with PET data on the same three parameters and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parametric maps of PWI attained a higher resolution than the PET maps and revealed focal perfusion failure on a gyrus-by-gyrus level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative CBV and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> obtained with PWI showed significant linear correlations with the corresponding PET values (CBV, R2 = 0.47 to 0.58; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, R2 = 0.32 to 0.68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found that we could detect regions with abnormally elevated OEF and CBV based on the delay of PWI-measured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> relative to the control region by defining a 2.0-sec delay as a threshold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity were 92.3% and 100% in detecting regions with abnormally elevated OEF, and 20.0% and 100% in detecting regions with abnormally elevated CBV, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the parameters obtained with PWI, our results suggested that the relative CBV value and delay of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> might be quantitatively manipulated to assist in clinical decision-making for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
