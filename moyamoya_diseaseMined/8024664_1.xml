<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients were studied: 1 was studied both before and after surgery and 4 were studied only after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine hemispheres of these 5 patients were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration increased immediately after beginning <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This parameter later decreased sharply to below the prehyperventilation level and remained at the reduced level for a prolonged period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes in oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration were similar to those previously reported in arterial blood oxygen and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> tension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of variance in oxygenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration (C-HV) was significantly greater in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> patients than in healthy controls (P &lt; .003, Wilcoxon test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes of NIRS after operation were markedly more sensitive than those of electroencephalography or single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NIRS could be applied to cerebral oxygenation as well as cerebral hemodynamics, which may be used to better define the time sequence and pathologic processes of various childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
