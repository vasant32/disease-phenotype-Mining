<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Then, the role of NO was clinically investigated in the pathogenesis of progressive cerebral vascular occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">disease, moyamoya</z:e> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rat, the cerebral arterioles, about 30-60 microm in diameter, were dilated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>, a precursor of NO, at concentrations as low as 0.1 micromol with maximal dilation of 14% at 100 micromol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The arterioles were constricted by N(G)-monomethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28229">L-NMMA</z:chebi>), a NO synthesis inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, which seems to protect NO from inactivation, increased sensitivity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with control specimens of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) obtained from 16 patients, concentrations NO metabolites in the CSF of 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NO metabolites concentrations obtained during initial surgery decreased during a second, contralateral procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NO plays an important role in the regulation of basal tone of cerebral parenchymal arterioles and contributes to the increase in collateral circulation in cerebral occlusive disease like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
