<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Open surgery (n=448), endovascular procedures (n=22), and stereotactic radiosurgery (n=14) were the main neurosurgical procedures adopted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical features and surgical outcomes were described according to the etiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and the number of years of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 34 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 7.1 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (62%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical mortality related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> was 0.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven percent had Karnofsky Performance Scale scores of more than 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate increasing detection rates and improving outcomes in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical course in this study shows that recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> in children is good after neurosurgical procedures </plain></SENT>
