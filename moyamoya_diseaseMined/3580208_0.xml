<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one cases were children and other nineteen were adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No or only slight neurological deficit were found at the CBF studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF was calculated by initial slope index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For investigation of the relation between hemispheric blood flow and age, the regression curve was calculated and that with highest correlation was chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the relationship between hemispheric CBF and age was correlated to following equation: y = 146.5-58.4 log x (r = -0.903) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, it was correlated to following equation: log y = 2.04-0.23 log x (r = -0.730) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It can be said that CBF of the whole brain in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the rCBF was characteristic in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There are low CBF values in the frontal and temporal lobes and relatively high values in the occipital lobes as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBF distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results are thought to indicate the importance of blood circulation to the brain from the vertebro-basilar arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover a comparison of these CBF results with the six stages of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> seen angiographically was investigated in child cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As the stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> progressed, the hemispheric CBF decreased gradually and the distribution of blood flow gradually changed from a predominance of flow to the frontal lobes to a predominance of flow to the occipital lobes </plain></SENT>
