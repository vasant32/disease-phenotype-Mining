<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease's etiology is still widely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several publications describe histopathological changes in the walls of affected vessels similar to those seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the DNA of European patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 17 SNPs in or adjacent to 11 genes (ELN, LIMK1, CDKN2A/B, CXCL12, Pseudogene ENSG00000197218, PSRC1, MTHFD1L, SMAD3, MIA3, PDGF-B, TIMP2) comparing 40 DNA samples of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> patients to 68 healthy controls from central Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD)-related symptoms was 15.4 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Genotyping was performed by sequencing the SNP containing genetic regions with custom-made primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found strong association of one SNP (rs599839 [A/G], OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.17, 4.05; p = 0.01) with the risk allele G located in the 3' UTR region of the PSRC-1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three further SNPs (rs8326, rs34208922, rs501120) in or adjacent to the genes ELN and CXCL12 showed tendencies towards risk alleles with p values between 0.1 and 0.2 but did not reach statistical significance in our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a possible parallel of common processes in the genesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further analyses in larger European cohorts and replication in patients of different ethnicity may lead to possible early detection of patients at risk for developing MMD and subsequently to future causative therapies </plain></SENT>
