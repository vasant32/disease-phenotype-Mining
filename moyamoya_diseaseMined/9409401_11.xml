<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is known that MMD exists in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> races, there is a predilection for people of Asian origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of the relatively high percentage of Asians living in Hawaii, it was hypothesized that the estimated prevalence of MMD would be higher in Hawaii than the remaining US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> practicing neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and major hospitals in Hawaii were surveyed for MMD patients treated during the past 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Medical records and angiograms (when available) were reviewed and the diagnostic guidelines for MMD from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 53 records reviewed in 42 patients; 21 fulfilled the criteria for definite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> which were the focus of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Hawaii, the prevalence of MMD was higher in patients of Japanese descent compared to Caucasians (P = 0.012) and higher than in the remaining US (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Non-Japanese Asians and Pacific Islanders had a higher incidence of MMD than Caucasians that was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in MMD among Japanese living in Hawaii or Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Males had an equal percentage of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>; females tended to have a higher incidence of ischemic events rather than <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Age and sex distribution of our series were similar to larger reported MMD studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that: (1) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in Hawaii has a higher incidence and prevalence than the rest of the US, largely due to the larger percentage of Asians, particularly Japanese, living in Hawaii; and (2) genetic rather than environmental factors may explain the increased MMD in Hawaii </plain></SENT>
