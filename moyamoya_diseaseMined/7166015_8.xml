<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three young autopsy and four temporal artery biopsy cases with an arteriographically typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> were studied by histologic, electron microscopic, and immunofluorescence methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> autopsy cases the intracranial segment of the internal carotid arteries showed concentric intimal thickening with severe stenosis or obstruction of the lumen, folding of the internal elastic lamina, and shrinkage of the external diameter of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory infiltration was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal networks of thin-walled vessels, interpreted as secondary collaterals, were seen at the base and on the convexity of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degenerative changes, including a ruptured coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in one case, were also noted in the coronary and temporal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both the intra- and extracranial arteries repeated endothelial damage was indicated by the presence of redundant subendothelial basement membrane-like material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> or calcium deposits were exceptional, and no evidence for the presence of immunoglobulins or components of the complement could be obtained by immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These pathologic alterations, distinct from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and the established types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, seem to be identical in children and adults, in spite of different clinical manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> in these age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that a humoral factor, associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, may induce repeated endothelial damage and intimal thickening in the intracranial arteries of genetically predisposed children in analogy with recent observations made in the coronary arteries of young subjects </plain></SENT>
