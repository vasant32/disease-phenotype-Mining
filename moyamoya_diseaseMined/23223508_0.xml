<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to clarify the incidence, locations, and longitudinal course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 78 nontreated patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence and locations of silent microbleeds were evaluated on T2*-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> examinations were repeated every 6 or 12 months during a mean follow-up period of 43.1 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: T2*-weighted MRI identified silent microbleeds in 17 (29.3%) of 58 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but in none of 20 pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During follow-up periods, de novo silent microbleeds developed in 4 (6.9%) of 58 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 4 patients (6.9%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of who had silent microbleeds on initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of silent microbleeds was a significant predictor for subsequent hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Careful and long-term follow-up of silent microbleeds would be essential to improve their outcome in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
