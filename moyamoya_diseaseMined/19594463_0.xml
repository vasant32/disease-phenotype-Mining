<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> has been increasingly recognized in children in recent years, but diagnosis and management can be difficult because of the diversity of underlying risk factors, atypical presentation and the absence of a uniform treatment approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, clinical presentation, imaging findings and outcomes of paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Eastern Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 25 patients (11 boys and 14 girls) using computerized tomography scan of the brain, magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiac assessment, haematological tests, immunological tests, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and metabolic screening were also performed in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After discharge, the patients were monitored regularly in the neurology clinic to detect their outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 76% of the patients presented with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, while the remaining 24% had haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sickle cell disease</z:e> (SCD) was the commonest risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (36%) followed by non determinate causes (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> was the commonest clinical presentation (54%) followed by haemiplegia (31%) and decreased level of consciousness (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrence occurred in SCD patients (80%) and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding the outcome, long-term deficit was the commonest (44%), while short-term deficit and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were equal (28% each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study in Eastern Province, KSA, showed agreement with other studies regarding risk factors, clinical presentation, imaging features and outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in children, yet with some points of differences, which are as follows: (1) SCD is the commonest risk factor in our study population, while in Chinese study it was not, (2) The percentage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e> as a risk factor in this study was less than that in the European and American studies, and (3) there was relative discrepancy regarding predictors of outcome </plain></SENT>
