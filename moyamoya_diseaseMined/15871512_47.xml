<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Recently, intraoperative fluorescence angiography in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> (ICG) is used as a tracer has been introduced as a novel technique to confirm successful <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess whether ICG videoangiography is also suitable for intraoperative confirmation of extracranial-intracranial bypass patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients undergoing cerebral revascularization for hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (11 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya-moya disease</z:e> (18 patients), or complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (11 patients) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass surgery was performed 35 times in 30 patients (five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> underwent bilateral procedures), STA-posterior cerebral artery bypass surgery in two patients, and saphenous vein (SV) high-flow bypass surgery in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In each patient, following the completion of the anastomosis, ICG (0.3 mg/kg body weight) was given systemically via an intravenous bolus injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A near-infrared light emitted by laser diodes was used to illuminate the operating field and the intravascular fluorescence was recorded using an optical filter-equipped video camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings of ICG videoangiography were compared with those of postoperative digital subtraction (DS) or computerized tomography (CT) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases excellent visualization of cerebral arteries, the bypass graft, and brain perfusion was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">Indocyanine green</z:chebi> videoangiography was used to identify four nonfunctioning STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypasses, which could be revised successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two cases of SV high-flow bypasses, ICG videoangiography revealed stenosis at the proximal anastomotic site, which was also revised successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the final findings of ICG videoangiography could be positively validated during the postoperative course by performing DS or CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">Indocyanine green</z:chebi> videoangiography provides a reliable and rapid intraoperative assessment of bypass patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, ICG videoangiography may help reduce the incidence of early bypass graft failure </plain></SENT>
