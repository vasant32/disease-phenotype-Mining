<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the risk factors for postoperative neurological deterioration in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we retrospectively reviewed the perioperative course of 368 cases of revascularization surgery in 216 patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk factors anecdotally associated with postoperative ischemic events were analyzed by comparing groups with or without a history of such events on the operative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic events were noted in 14 cases (3.8%), 4 of which were defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and the others as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperative neurological deterioration more often developed in patients who suffered from frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, had precipitating factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, and underwent indirect nonanastomotic revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the incidence of postoperative ischemic events were related more to the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and the type of surgical procedure than to other factors, including <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IMPLICATIONS: Although preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the major concern for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, risk factors for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the perioperative course in 368 cases with this disease and found that the severity of the disease and type of surgical procedure were major determinants of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
