<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) levels were also measured repeatedly at predetermined interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two cases (group H), the ETCO2 was controlled at hypercapnic levels during surgery (45.5 +/- 1.5 mmHg) and the remaining four (group N) were operated on in a normocapnic state (39.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The group H patients demonstrated high levels of SjO2 ranging from 72 to 85%, indicative of excessive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the group H patients demonstrated mild and transient motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The group N patients demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of SjO2 ranging from 66 to 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients in both groups demonstrated fluctuations in SjO2 levels in clear positive correlation with spontaneous changes in PaCO2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present findings indicated that: (1) Global carbon dioxide reactivity of cerebral perfusion is well preserved in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>; and (2) <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> in these patients often causes excessive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of postoperative neurological deficits in association with such an excessive hyperemia suggests that hyperapnia during surgery is not always beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative monitoring of SjO2 is useful for maintaining cerebral perfusion within the optimum range </plain></SENT>
