<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient with a primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (PIVH) in whom an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery was angiographically demonstrated and in whom collateral type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> circulation was found as was the presence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the right coroid territory is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The association of PIVH, unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is infrequent in the literature, with the origin of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, in some cases, having been attributed to rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since angiographic control was not available in the patient presented it cannot be excluded that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was really a pseudoaneurysm therefore being a consequence, rather than a cause, of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial rupture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus one of the other mechanisms proposed must be invoked to explain the pathogenesis of the PIVH: rupture of a perforating artery or of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysm</z:e> located in the subependimary periventricular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment recommended for these case of PIVH associated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is chirurgical if persistence is demonstrated in successive arteriographies </plain></SENT>
