<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old, non-hypertensive farmer, who had sudden attack of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, was transferred to our clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He presented comatous state and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> without extraocular movements nor reactive pupils to light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT scan, 7 hours after the ictus showed intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in the right temporo-parietal region with ventricular extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following bilateral carotid angiograms established the diagnosis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In angiograms of the affected side, irregular spotty stains spread from the periphei of the right posterior choroidal artery was delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The repeated CT scan after that indicated increment of <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three hours from the ictus, the patient died and an autopsy study was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the fixation, the coronal brain section was made, and the careful observation of them elucidated the formation of an organized dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the angiographically extravasated vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>About seven hundreds of serial specimen, 4 micron in thickness, was then investigated adjacent to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The organized dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> seemed to initiate from the branch of it, where marked fraying and undulation of the fibroelastic intima and internal elastic laminae were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The concavity toward the true lumen was completely disrupted and communicated to the extravascular space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result, the continuous part of it obstructed the lumen of the branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested the newly-developed dissection and it seemed to correspond to the angiographical extravasated points </plain></SENT>
