<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We describe the clinical, diagnostic, and outcome features of a cohort of white patients with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> treated in a German institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our cohort included 21 white patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and diagnostic features were obtained by retrospective chart review; follow-up information and outcome were obtained prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk by treatment status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was 31 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The female predominance was 4.25:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, the initial symptom was a cerebral ischemic event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no patient with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; only one patient experienced subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the further course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was very high after the first ischemic event and smaller after angiographic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year-Kaplan-Meier risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 80.95% after the first ischemic event for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most subsequent ischemic events appeared in the first 2 years after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (52.3%) underwent neurosurgical revascularizing procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the Kaplan-Meier risk of perioperative or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 27.27% within the first month and was stable thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features and course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> of whites analyzed in this German study are comparable to American results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in whites differs clearly from Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in timing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of vasculopathy and lower rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
