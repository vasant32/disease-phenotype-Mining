<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the highest incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is in pediatric patients, pathology reports have been primarily limited to adult samples and describe occlusive fibrocellular lesions in the intimae of affected arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a young girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751322" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary moyamoya disease</z:e> who presented at 18 months of age with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> following an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed stenosis of the distal left ICA, left middle cerebral artery, and right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An emergent left-sided dural inversion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and alternating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> necessitated a right dural inversion 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> proved uniquely refractory to surgical revascularization, and she succumbed to recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and neurological deterioration at 2.5 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological specimens revealed a striking bilateral occlusion of the anterior carotid circulation resulting from intimal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most strikingly, the ascending aorta and the superior mesenteric artery demonstrated similar intimal proliferation, along with SMC proliferation in the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The systemic pathology involving multiple arteries in this extremely young child, the first case of its kind available for autopsy, suggests that globally uncontrolled SMC proliferation, in the absence of environmental risk factors and likely resulting from an underlying genetic alteration, may be a primary etiologic event leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
