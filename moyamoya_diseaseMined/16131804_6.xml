<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been acknowledged as a noninvasive diagnostic modality for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in terms of staging of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, conventional angiography is still the gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to establish MRA grades for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> as an alternative to conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two patients (44 sides) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> diagnosed by conventional angiography were evaluated by MRA during the past 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRA scores were assigned based on the severity of occlusive changes of the internal carotid artery, the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery, the anterior and the posterior cerebral arteries and the signals of the distal branches of these arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total points ranged from 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 10 (most severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRA scores (0-10) were significantly consistent with the conventional angiographic staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four grades based on this novel MRA scores correlated well with Suzuki's stages, with high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These novel MRA grades can be a reliable alternative to conventional staging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By employing these novel MRA grades, the use of conventional angiography can be avoided for the purpose of evaluation of the stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
