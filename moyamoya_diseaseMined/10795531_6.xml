<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to examine the incidence and types of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> variations detected by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between April 1996 and March 1999, cranial MRA was performed in 432 cases at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients examined had or were suspected to have cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After excluding 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, we retrospectively reviewed 425 MRA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A 1.5-T scanner was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> studies, and maximum-intensity projection images obtained using the three-dimensional time-of-flight technique were displayed stereoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 425 patients MRA revealed 16 anomalous <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>, including 9 duplicated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>, 5 accessory <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>, and 2 fenestrated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>, which is a rate of 3.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, although the clinical significance is not great, we found a relatively high incidence of anomalous <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We stress that knowledge and recognition of these variations are useful and important during the interpretation of cranial MRA </plain></SENT>
