<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the first predictive case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in a boy born to a woman who underwent surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> when she was 3 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We educated the mother and her family not to miss his initial signs of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His family could easily notice his brief episode of ischemic attack when he was 6 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent superficial temporal artery-to-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and indirect bypass on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it is quite important to educate the family not to miss the initial signs of disease in their offspring, at least when they have a genetic background of the disease, because early diagnosis and effective treatment are essential to improve the long-term outcome in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
