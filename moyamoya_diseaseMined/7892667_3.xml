<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We introduced a surgical revascularization using gracilis muscle transplantation to these territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1991 and May 1993, six children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, between the age of 3 and 13 years, underwent gracilis muscle transplantation to the territory of either the anterior or the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean period of follow-up after surgery was 15.2 months, with a range of 5 to 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the six patients had suffered from frequent transient visual disturbance and were treated with unilateral or bilateral gracilis muscle transplantation to the territory of the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other three patients had suffered from frequent transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and/or rectal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>, and were treated with gracilis muscle transplantation bilaterally to the territories of the anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with gracilis muscle transplantation unilaterally or bilaterally to the occipital lobes manifested complete disappearance of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients with gracilis muscle transplantation bilaterally to the frontal lobes also manifested complete disappearance of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient who underwent the transplantation bilaterally to the frontal lobes, continued to have episodes of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, postsurgically, but the frequency of symptoms was markedly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> in the territories of the anterior and/or posterior cerebral arteries could be overcome with the use of gracilis muscle transplantation in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
