<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The autopsy findings of the brain revealed cerebral and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left anterior cerebral artery, bilateral middle cerebral arteries and left posterior cerebral artery were marked narrowing, and the other arteries revealed mild narrowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, the arteries of the circle of Willis showed narrowed lumen, fibrocellular intimal thickening, marked tortuousness of internal elastic lamina and attenuation of media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thickened intima was composed of smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vessels with dilated or irregular-shaped lumen suggested abnormal vascular networks demonstrated by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, no correlation between the abnormal vascular network and expression of VEGF or VEGF receptor was disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that abnormal vascular networks might be composed of collateral vessels in relation to various pathological changes of the arteries, such as occlusion and stenosis, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> might occur as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rupture of arteries</z:e> including abnormal vascular networks </plain></SENT>
