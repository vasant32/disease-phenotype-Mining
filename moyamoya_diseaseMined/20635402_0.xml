<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report on a 46-year-old Hispanic woman who was previously diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> on magnetic resonance imaging after a presentation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-like symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her features were consistent with TS and chromosome analysis revealed mosaicism in which 17% of the cells showed a pseudoisodicentric Y chromosome: 45,X (25)/46,X psu idic (Y)(11.2) (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A preceding screening transthoracic echocardiogram had shown a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>) with an aortic diameter of 3.2 cm; at the time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> diagnosis, the aorta was 3.5 cm with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four years later, the patient had had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissection</z:hpo>, Stanford type A, which was repaired successfully </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The small number of cases does not allow detailed analysis other than noting patient age (two older than 40 years), karyotype (two others associated with isochrome Xq), and associated cardiac risk factors (one with <z:mp ids='MP_0010484'>BAV</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although this may be a chance occurrence, we hypothesize that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> could be a manifestation of the vasculopathy in TS </plain></SENT>
