<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intimal thickening of the scalp arteries developed significantly at an early age in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histopathological findings of the neointima in scalp arteries were almost similar to those in intracranial arteries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SMCs cultured from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> arteries responded significantly less to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, especially to platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), than those of control patients, the finding of which was explained by the reduced number of PDGF receptor on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> SMCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate the presence of systemic factors that promote migration and proliferation of SMCs from the media to the intima in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that alteration in vascular cells may contribute to the development of intimal thickening in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
