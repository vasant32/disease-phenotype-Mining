<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we study the autoimmune antibody in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and discuss its relationship with the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoimmune antibody was evaluated in 13 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of the patients ranged from 13 to 55, with an average of 37 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight were females, 5 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autoantibody was studied with native DNA (double strand DNA) and ANA (antinuclear antibody) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibody was noted in 3 cases (23%) in native DNA study, and 2 cases (15%) in ANA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly high incidence was recognized compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In relation to the clinical features, such as initial symptoms, time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, neurological findings, no significant correlation was recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that immunological factors might play a partial role in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
