<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the differences in pathogenesis, the 2 disorders share some clinical features which can lead to diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo>: both can affect young adults, cause intermittent neurological symptoms, and show multifocal abnormalities on brain imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To emphasize the need for early consideration of MM in the differential diagnosis of MS-spectrum disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Chart reviews and individual case analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We present detailed descriptions of 3 patients with MM, and summary data on 8 additional cases, in which there was diagnostic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> with MS, with delays in treatment ranging from 2 months to 19 years (median=4 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MM can be misdiagnosed as MS, leading to delay in correct treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We highlight the clinical and radiologic features which allow differentiation of these conditions early in the course, when treatment can have maximum benefit </plain></SENT>
