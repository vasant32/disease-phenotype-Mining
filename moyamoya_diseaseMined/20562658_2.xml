<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with idiopathic stenosis or occlusion of the basal arteries, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collateral vessel formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified patients who presented to our institution from 1996 to 2005 with occlusive disease of the distal internal carotid artery or the proximal middle or anterior cerebral arteries demonstrated by digital subtraction cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We excluded those with evidence of atherosclerotic disease, systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo>, or any other condition that could otherwise explain their <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial occlusive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for presenting symptoms and clinical characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome was determined from chart review and phone interviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age at presentation ranged from 34 to 71 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; 5 had unilateral intracranial disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on medical therapy occurred in none of the 5 during an average follow-up of 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven had bilateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred between 2 and 107 months after the initial event in 5 of 8 medically treated hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> collateral vessels developed in 1 patient as shown on follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical features and outcome of these patients are similar to those reported in large case series of North American patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a common etiology for the basal arterial occlusive process and a variable ability to form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
