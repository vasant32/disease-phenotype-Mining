<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four asymptomatic cases, signal intensity of both total P and total ATP was almost equal in each voxel, but in other cases, both signal intensity of the lesion was relatively decreased, compared with non-lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially, signal intensity of total P and total ATP in ischemic lesion was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
