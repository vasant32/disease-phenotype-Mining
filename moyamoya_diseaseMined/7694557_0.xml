<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By supplying sufficient blood flow to the distal area of the stenosis or occlusion, ischemic symptom could be improved and the risk of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> are lessen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Encephalo-Myo-Synangiosis (EMS) can increase the blood supply from external carotid artery to the ischemic area just put the temporal muscle on the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A kind of growth factor are thought to be exist around the brain of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) contribute <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect is considered to grow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> and many experiments are done to use it for therapy by blocking this effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Few trials are done to utilize the angiogenetic effect for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of the bFGF on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after EMS by using rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We operated EMS on 10 male SDrats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0.1 microgram of the bFGF was poured on 5 rats between the brain and muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other 5 rats just saline was poured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One week after rats were sacrificed, new vessels were observed with light microscope and scanning electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Molding models were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>bFGF group grew larger new vessels between the brain and muscle than non bFGF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>On the surface of brain, bFGF had more larger vessels (diameter is over 6 um) and non bFGF group had more small vessels (less than 6 um) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Total area of vessel of bFGF group was twice as large as that of non bFGF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>On molding models many closed end of vessels were seen and they were thought to be the growing vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In molding models, bFGF group also has larger vessels than non bFGF group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We could prove that bFGF promotes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> on EMS of the rats, and we also expect that bFGF help the supplying blood flow of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patient </plain></SENT>
