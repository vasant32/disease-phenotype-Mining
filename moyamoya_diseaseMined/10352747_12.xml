<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (rCMRO2) and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the striatum were measured before and after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Correlation between the change of these PET parameters and post-operative decreased opacification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre-operatively, significant elevation of rCBV were observed in the basal ganglia as well as significant reduction of rCBF and elevation of rOEF with reduction of rCMRO2 in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories, indicating "misery" perfusion in the cerebral hemisphere and blood pooling in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels under increased haemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Post-operative PET study showed improvement of misery perfusion and reduction of rCBV in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of rCBV in the basal ganglia generally compatible with decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels on angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggests that direct bypass surgery could have a potential both for decreasing haemodynamic stress on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels and to improve misery perfusion in the hemisphere </plain></SENT>
