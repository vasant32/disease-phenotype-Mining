<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown and surgical revascularization remains the mainstay treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed various hemodynamic factors in 292 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, representing 496 revascularization procedures, including vessel dimension and intraoperative blood flow, using a perivascular ultrasonic flowprobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) flow rate was 4.4 ± 0.26 mL/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After superficial temporal artery (STA)-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery, flows at the microanastomosis were increased fivefold to a mean of 22.2 ± 0.8 mL/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flows were significantly lower in the pediatric (16.2 ± 1.3 mL/min) compared with the adult (23.9 ± 1.0 mL/min; P&lt;0.0001) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased local flow rates were associated with clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Permanent postoperative complications were low (&lt;5%), but very high postanastomosis <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow was associated with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (31.2 ± 6.8 mL/min; P=0.045), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (32.1 ± 10.2 mL/min; P=0.045), and transient neurologic deficits (28.6 ± 5.6 mL/min; P=0.047) compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other flow and vessel dimension data are presented to elucidate the hemodynamic changes related to the vasculopathy and subsequent to surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
