<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One woman had been found to have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, following a series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> during her first pregnancy, which ended in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On this occasion she was delivered by cesarean section under slowly-induced epidural anesthesia, using ephedrine to maintain the blood pressure, and transcranial Doppler revealed no change in signal in her left middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both mother and baby had an uneventful post natal course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case involved a primiparous woman with a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> that had been detected following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002197'>generalized seizures</z:hpo>, which were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her cesarean section was conducted under spinal anesthesia, and her blood pressure maintained with ephedrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Again transcranial Doppler revealed no change in signal in her middle cerebral artery during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe this is a potentially useful technique to monitor the cerebral circulation intraoperatively in the presence of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
