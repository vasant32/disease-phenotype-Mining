<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the conditions promoting such <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> to provide the basis for surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The degree of cerebral hemodynamic stress was studied in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> using the stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced computed tomographic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> tolerance test and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were subjected to surgery in which scalp arteries were placed on the cerebral cortex without vessel-to-vessel anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Formation of the newly vascularized collateral network connecting the implanted artery to cortical arteries was assessed angiographically 12 to 17 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative average resting cerebral blood flow for cortex that developed revascularization of cortical arteries was not significantly different from that for cortex that did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, cortex that developed revascularization had an average preoperative increase of blood flow by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> treatment of -3.29 +/- 4.6 mL/min per 100 cm3 (n = 20), which was significantly less (P = .0034) than that of cortex that did not show revascularization (20.7 +/- 4.3 mL/min per 100 cm3; n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good revascularization developed when the cortex showed increase of blood flow by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> treatment of less than 0 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography data indicated that revascularization developed when the cortex was under "misery perfusion." Postoperative hemodynamics were ameliorated by revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> to connect the implanted scalp arteries to the cerebral cortical arteries was selectively initiated when <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of hemodynamic origin existed </plain></SENT>
