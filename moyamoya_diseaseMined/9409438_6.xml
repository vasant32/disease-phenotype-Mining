<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SOCW is characterized by the angiographical findings of the obstructive vascular lesions around the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries and the formation of abnormal vascular networks visualized in the arterial phase without any definite underlying conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a detailed histopathological observation of 31 autopsy cases with SOCW to discuss its etiology which is still a matter of dispute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The obstructive vascular lesion around the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries which is thought to be the primary site affected in SOCW is due to multilayered eccentric intimal fibrous thickening suggestive of organized mural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In fact, we found thrombotic lesions frequently in the major cerebral arteries, including those of the circle of Willis, of autopsy cases with SOCW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This fact supports the idea that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> play an important role in establishment of the vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extracranial vessels are also shown to be involved and it is conceivable that the systemic etiologic factor, such as the systemic background to form <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>, exists in patients with SOCW </plain></SENT>
