<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the technique of endovascular access for treatment of vasospasm of a radial artery bypass graft from the occipital artery to the M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman presented with recurrent right-sided ischemic symptoms in the territory of a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings were consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and a perfusion deficit was identified on computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent a left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass graft for flow augmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She returned with an occluded bypass graft, collateralization of the anterior <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory through a spontaneous synangiosis, and a severe perfusion deficit in the posterior <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She underwent a revision bypass graft procedure with the radial artery from the occipital artery stump to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-M3 branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She developed repeated symptomatic vasospasm of the radial artery graft postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After systemic anticoagulation, the graft was accessed through the occipital artery, and intra-arterial <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When this failed to resolve the graft spasm, the radial artery graft was accessed with a 0.14-inch Synchro-2 microwire (Boston Scientific, Natick Massachusetts), and sequential angioplasties were performed using over-the-wire balloons from the proximal to distal anastomosis and in the occipital artery stump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> patch was applied cutaneously over the graft to relieve the vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Graft patency with robust flow was observed on the 5-month follow-up angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular techniques can be safely used for salvage of spastic extracranial-intracranial grafts </plain></SENT>
