<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To reveal the current clinical situation, the authors conducted Japan's first nationwide survey of pregnancy and delivery associated with MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 270 perinatal medical centers across Japan to survey their experiences with delivery associated with MMD within the preceding 5 years (Survey I); another questionnaire was sent to 554 adult female patients with MMD regarding their experience with childbirth (Survey II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survey I included 59 deliveries among patients with previously diagnosed MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of perinatal neurological events and morbidity was 5.1% and 1.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In another five cases, newly diagnosed after perinatal attacks, disability was noted in three cases, including one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survey II included 278 deliveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perinatal attack rate was 6.6% in 76 previously diagnosed cases and 2.0% in 202 cases undiagnosed at pregnancy, but neither group reported permanent morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Caesarean section in previously diagnosed cases accounted for 76.3% of deliveries in Survey I and 69.7% in Survey II, but no significant difference in event rate was found between caesarean section and vaginal delivery in either survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of perinatal neurological events is low when MMD has been diagnosed, careful monitoring is required in light of the potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serious events, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, can occur if MMD has not been diagnosed at pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further efforts to establish management guidelines are required to ensure safer childbirth in patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
