<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Some adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been treated successfully by indirect revascularization alone, although surgical indications and hemodynamic changes for these patients have not been fully explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine surgical indications for this procedure, we studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and angiographic findings in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: On 17 hemispheric sides of 12 adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> treated surgically with a combination of various indirect procedures, mainly by encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, we retrospectively evaluated changes in rCBF using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography, angiographic collateral formation, and clinical results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperatively, the rCBF values in the cortices at the bypass site at rest and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading were lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rCBF values were significantly increased after revascularization, approaching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, except for incomplete recovery of vascular reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of postoperative neovascularization from implanted tissues fed by the external carotid artery system was more developed, in parallel with the preoperative decrease in resting and loading rCBF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-third of the operated sides exhibiting both a low rCBF at rest and impaired vascular reactivity in the noninfarcted cortices achieved good revascularization over two-thirds of the middle cerebral artery territory, accompanied by rCBF improvement and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessel regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enough potential for neovascularization in the noninfarcted cortices was indicated that the resting rCBF was lower than 50 ml/100 g per minute (below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value by 2 standard deviations) and did not increase more than that value after loading, even in a 40-year-old patient who presented with a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically, 11 patients (92%) had good results at the 4-year follow-up, whereas 1 patient (8%) with unsatisfactory neovascularization and a lesser extent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessel reduction experienced rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that for the surgical treatment of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, indirect procedures, mainly encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, are recommended for patients with lower rCBF and no or negative vascular reactivity in the noninfarcted cortices, as well as for those who have no indication for the direct procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is possible to determine these indications by a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic study including an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test </plain></SENT>
