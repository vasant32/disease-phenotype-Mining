<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activities of daily living (ADL) was assessed and graded into five levels both at the time of admission into hospital and at the last assessment in the follow-up study, as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grade I: Fully capable of work or study with no or minimal difficulty, II: Capable of limited work or study with difficulty, III: Incapable of work or study but capable of home life alone, IV: Incapable of home life without help, V: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917808" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vegetative state</z:e> or dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups by the age of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>: younger pediatric, less than 5 years old (21 patients); older pediatric, 5 to 15 years old (14 patients); and adult, 16 years old and over (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although analysis of the angiographical and neurological pictures is important, the present paper concerns only the age of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and whether reconstructive vascular surgery was performed, because of the small number of clinical materials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of 16 adults suffered hemorrhagic attacks and 2 of them died of hemorrhagic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, none of the pediatric cases had hemorrhagic attacks and none died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both at the time of admission and last assessment, ADL of younger pediatric cases was much lower than that of older ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that clinical course in patients with "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>" closely related with the age of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of illness, and the border <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of illness between patients with good outcome and with poor outcome is around 5 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
