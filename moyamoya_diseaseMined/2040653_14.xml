<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) from scalp arteries of five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated the responsiveness of the cells in culture to serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a major <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> of SMC, and compared the response to that of cells derived from age-matched control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SMC from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> proliferated less rapidly in a medium with 15% serum than did control SMC and responded poorly to the addition of PDGF to 5% serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PDGF alone did not stimulate SMC in a quiescent state to initiate DNA synthesis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, without serum factors other than bovine serum albumin, though it significantly stimulated the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous additions of epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, and PDGF stimulated initiation of DNA synthesis in cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but not as much as PDGF alone did in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although direct correlations with the pathogenesis of the disease remain to be clarified, the results indicate altered interrelations between serum factors and the cellular responses in vessels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
