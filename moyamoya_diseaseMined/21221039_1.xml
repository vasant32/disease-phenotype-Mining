<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence suggests that focal cerebral hyperperfusion is a potential complication of this procedure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the exact differences in the incidence and clinical manifestations of this phenomenon between patients with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I]iodoamphetamine single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was performed 1 and 7 days after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis on 121 hemispheres from 86 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (2-67 years of age; mean, 34.3 years) and on 28 hemispheres from 28 non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients (12-67 years of age; mean, 56.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of symptomatic hyperperfusion, defined as a significant focal increase in cerebral blood flow at the site of the anastomosis that is responsible for the apparent neurological signs, was compared between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion including mild focal neurological signs was seen in 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (26 hemispheres, 21.5%) but in none of the patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (P = .0069) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was significantly associated with the development of symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion (P = .0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with symptomatic hyperperfusion were relieved by intensive blood pressure control, and no patients suffered from permanent neurological deficit caused by hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion is a potential complication of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Accurate diagnosis and adequate management of hyperperfusion are recommended, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
