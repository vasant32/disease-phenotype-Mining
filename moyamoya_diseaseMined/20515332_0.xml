<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have observed that the bony carotid canal is hypoplastic in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bony carotid canal development should represent internal carotid artery (ICA) development, and may stop with the beginning of ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> by measuring the bony carotid canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter of the bony carotid canal was evaluated on 4-mm thick bone window CT scans of the skull base in 60 Japanese patients aged 20-80 years, who had minor head trauma or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> considered to be unrelated to the skull base or arterial systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relationship between age and bony carotid canal development was assessed in a second group of 50 patients aged 0-19 years, including 10 under 2 years, using CT scans with the same parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the bony carotid canal in 17 Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diameter in adults was 5.27 +/- 0.62 mm (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bony carotid canal developed rapidly before approximately 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After fusion of the bony suture, the bony carotid canal developed slowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean diameter of the bony carotid canal was 3.31 +/- 0.44 mm in 11 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>According to the apparent curve of bony carotid canal development, ICA stenosis was assumed to start in early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most cases of Asian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may arise in childhood and that many Asian adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may develop occlusive vasculopathy in childhood </plain></SENT>
