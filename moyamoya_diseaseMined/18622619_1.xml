<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To monitor patency of the bypass and to accomplish comprehensive visualized evaluation of brain surface hemodynamics in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients, we performed intraoperative monitoring using novel infrared imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intraoperative monitoring of brain surface blood flow by IRIS V infrared imaging system has been conducted during superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis on seven sides of five pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (man/woman = 2:3, 7-8 years old) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The range of recipient artery was 0.7-0.8 mm (average 0.75 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography were performed routinely before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, patency of bypass, as well as detailed local hemodynamics and changes of brain surface temperature distribution could be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative infrared system will be a feasible monitoring not only for noninvasive intraoperative evaluation of bypass patency but also for local hemodynamics even in patients with childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
