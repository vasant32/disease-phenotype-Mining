<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the correlation between unilateral ivy proliferation in a hemisphere and cerebrovascular hemodynamic status to learn the clinical significance of the ivy sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation between ivy dominance on FLAIR images and hemodynamic status with use of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> 123 N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine ((123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distributional differences of ivy signs between both hemispheres were observed in 22 (64.7%) of 34 patients with a positive ivy sign, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom showed decreased vascular reserve/reactivity in the ivy-dominant hemisphere (IDH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the stage II (misery perfusion) area to IDH was higher than that in the ivy less-dominant hemisphere (ILDH) in the quantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean vascular reserve was lower in IDH than ILDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 15 of 22 patients who had bypass surgery on IDH because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of IDH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with symmetric ivy distributions showed a variety of hemodynamic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) stage of IDH (2.95 +/- 0.39) was higher compared with ILDH (2.60 +/- 0.50; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regional arteriocapillary circulation time ratio in IDH was longer compared with ILDH (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ivy proliferation decreased in 10 (55.6%) of 18 patients who underwent bypass surgery during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral hemispheric ivy proliferation correlated highly with the existence of an ipsilateral decreased vascular reserve associated with the development of leptomeningeal collaterals in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
