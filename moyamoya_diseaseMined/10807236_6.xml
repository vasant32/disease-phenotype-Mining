<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal vasculature often is identified after removal of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of dysplastic feeding vessels that resemble the neovascularity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, as distinct from residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, is crucial for preserving critical brain areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We review a large experience with immediate postoperative angiography after <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection and discuss the implications for management of abnormal dysplastic vessels discovered after <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Beginning in 1992, 86 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> underwent operations by standard protocol for immediate postoperative angiography under the same <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anesthetic</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic interpretation dictated admission to the intensive care unit or return to the operating room for further resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 78 patients, the angiogram revealed complete resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients were returned to the operating room, one for residual malformation with an early draining vein, and one for resection of residual dysplastic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was one postoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in a patient whose postoperative angiogram was falsely negative for <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients with residual dysplastic vessels mimicking residual <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, but without an early draining vein, were managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Delayed follow-up angiography demonstrated spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> of these abnormal vessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Residual dysplastic feeding vessels resembling the neovascularity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> but not associated with an early draining vein do not necessarily represent residual malformation after <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The abnormal vessels will proceed to complete spontaneous resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Given the difficulty of interpreting intraoperative angiography, immediate postoperative angiography may be a viable alternative after <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> resection </plain></SENT>
