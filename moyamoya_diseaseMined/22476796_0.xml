<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To clarify the most beneficial treatment of the management modality based on our experience with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1998 to 2010, clinical results of 142 patients (ischemic, 98; hemorrhagic, 44) with adult MMD were investigated according to management modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Revascularization surgery (direct, indirect, and combined bypass) was performed in 124 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We observed the clinical course of 18 patients who were treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome, angiographic features, hemodynamic change, and incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were investigated pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with ischemic MMD, direct and combined bypasses were more effective treatments to prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than indirect bypass surgery (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with hemorrhagic MMD, rebleeding was less likely to occur in patients who had undergone bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed in the rebleeding rate between patients with and without revascularization surgery (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An angiogram after bypass surgery comparing the extent of revascularization and reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in patients treated with direct, indirect, and combined bypass showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in favor of direct and combined bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiographic changes and SPECT results demonstrated significant statistical correlation (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Revascularization surgery was effective in further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> prevention to a statistically significant extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Direct and combined bypasses were more effective to prevent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than indirect bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, there is still no clear evidence that revascularization surgery significantly prevents rebleeding in adult MMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More significant angiographic changes were observed in direct and combined bypasses compared with indirect bypass </plain></SENT>
