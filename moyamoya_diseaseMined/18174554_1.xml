<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> in two European children and emphasize the importance of familial factors in the pathogenesis of this disease and its appearance not only in Asians but in the Western population as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a Greek female infant, also has <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her mother, also suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> and other family members, have similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coagulation disorders</z:e> (Factor V Leiden, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="29357,29358">Methylene</z:chebi>-tetrahydrofolic reductase and Factor II 20210A mutations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a Scottish boy, is unique in that familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> affects five members of three consecutive generations of his maternal family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis in the Greek family demonstrated no abnormality on chromosome 3p26, as in other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA and Y chromosomal genotype showed that affected members had the same sequence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>Mitochondrial</z:hpo> 3 portion of D-loop with Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> may vary across races and ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
