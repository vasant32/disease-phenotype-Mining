<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median time elapsed from baseline to last available MRA was 29 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRAs showed improvement, stabilization or worsening of cerebrovascular lesions in 11, 6 and 7 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete normalization of MRA was observed in 6 patients within a mean time of 1.4 years, but stenosis recurred at the same location in the 4 patients in whom transfusion therapy was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline severe stenosis/occlusion of large cerebral arteries and occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> were significantly associated with an absence of improvement of the cerebral vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data emphasize the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the course of cerebrovasculopathy in SS children receiving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to determine whether different therapeutic approaches have to be considered according to these different evolutive patterns in SS children </plain></SENT>
