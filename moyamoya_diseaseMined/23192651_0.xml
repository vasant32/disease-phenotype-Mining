<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pediatric MMD (PMMD) usually presents with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> is more common in adult MMD (AMMD), suggesting differences in cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the cortical flow velocity and direction of recipient arteries using micro-Doppler ultrasonography to evaluate the cortical circulation before and after anastomosis in MMD and ACVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients with adult MMD (AMMD), 7 with pediatric MMD (PMMD), 16 with ACVD, and 12 control patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A micro-Doppler probe was applied on the cortical recipient artery (A4 or M4) before and after anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Systolic maximum flow velocity (V (max)) and blood flow direction were investigated at proximal and distal parts of anastomosed sites in recipient arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative regional cerebral blood flow was measured by cold <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-computed tomography (Xe-CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before anastomosis, retrograde cortical flow was significantly more common in PMMD patients, and V (max) in cortical artery was significantly lower in AMMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bypass surgery changed the direction of blood flow from the anastomosis site to proximal and distal sites of the recipient artery in most patients, but pre-anastomosis flow direction was preserved more frequently in PMMD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate of V (max) increase after anastomosis was significantly higher in AMMD than in PMMD (11.6 ± 9.8 vs. 3.9 ± 1.8; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Micro-Doppler ultrasonography identified differences in cortical circulation among AMMD, PMMD, and ACVD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In AMMD, significantly low velocity in the cortical artery was observed before anastomosis, and bypass surgery reversed the flow and significantly increased flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data of PMMD showed unique hemodynamics of the cortical artery before anastomosis, characterized by a higher frequency of retrograde flow and preserved velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The V (max) increase rate was significantly higher in patients with postoperative cerebral hyperperfusion on Xe-CT, and further study is warranted to validate the clinical use of intraoperative micro-Doppler monitoring to predict postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
