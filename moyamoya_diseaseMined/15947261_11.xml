<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 77 (31 males, 46 females, age 6.6+/-3.2 years) patients with postoperative pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent basal/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress brain perfusion SPECT 6 to 12 months after revascularization surgery and who were followed-up &gt;12 months after SPECT were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up period after SPECT was 36+/-19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients underwent bilateral ribbon encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS), 14 bilateral EDAS, and 1 unilateral EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ordinal logistic regression analysis using 5 independent variables (infarction on preoperative MRI, age at the first operation, highest Suzuki stage on cerebral angiography, and regional cerebrovascular reserve on postoperative SPECT) against postoperative clinical outcomes was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one patients had preserved reserve on postoperative SPECT and their clinical outcomes were excellent (30), good (15), fair (4), and poor (2); 26 patients had decreased reserve (excellent, 1; good, 7; fair, 14; poor, 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On ordinal logistic regression analysis, age at the first operation (P=0.033) and reserve on postoperative SPECT (P&lt;0.001) were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basal/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stress brain perfusion SPECT performed at 6 to 12 months after the indirect bypass operation could predict the further clinical outcome of pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with decreased cerebrovascular reserve will have remaining neurological deficit and ischemic attacks on follow-up </plain></SENT>
