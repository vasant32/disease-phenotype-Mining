<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is most often progressive with associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> is not well described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe four women (ages 25-36) who were transferred to a rehabilitation service after an average 17 days (12-26 days) in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial functional impairment was estimated using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation (23-53 days) and was compared to the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation (UDSMR) for "first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>" patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Average admission FIM scores were similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> had a higher discharge FIM, longer length of stay, and slower rate of progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data on long-term survival and functional level would be useful, but it appears patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may benefit from rehabilitation oriented toward neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
