<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pattern of collateralization associated with isolated middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and the natural history of this entity have not been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Cerebral angiograms and CT angiograms performed between August 2004 and August of 2006 demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> collateralization were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> associated with a rete pattern of collateralization were included in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographic, clinical, and angiographic data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: There were three cases of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> pattern of collateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 36-years old, 2 were male, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average degree of stenosis was 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No stenosis was seen in the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries or elsewhere in the intracranial vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: We describe an unusual pattern of anastomosis associated with isolated severe middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
