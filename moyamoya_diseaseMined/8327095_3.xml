<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven of 57 sides treated by indirect anastomosis showed good filling of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory via the anastomosis, whereas 16 and 14 showed fair and poor collaterals via the anastomosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight cerebral hemispheres treated by indirect anastomosis underwent further surgery and received superficial temporal artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with or without EMS for still-existent recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> even after the indirect anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient still had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> after bilateral encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis, which had produced no effective collaterals in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory; the patient then underwent omental transplantation to the bilateral anterior cerebral artery and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories, resulting in the cessation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement after superficial temporal artery-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis with or without EMS was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, except on one side, where a completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had resulted in fixed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We do not know the reasons for the uncertainty of the development of collaterals via the indirect anastomosis, but there are many patients who still need direct reconstruction of the indirect anastomosis </plain></SENT>
