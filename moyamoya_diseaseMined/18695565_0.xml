<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 159 children (up to 15 yr of age, 76 boys and 83 girls) who underwent indirect revascularization procedures for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> between 1987 and 1998 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group A patients underwent simple EDAS (n = 67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group B patients underwent EDAS with bifrontal encephalogaleo(periosteal)synangiosis (n = 92) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgical results for each group were compared, in terms of clinical outcomes, neuroimaging changes, extent of revascularization evident on angiograms, and hemodynamic changes evident on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up periods were 45 months for Group A and 22 months for Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall clinical outcomes and neuroimaging changes tended to be better for Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In terms of single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic changes of the whole brain after surgery, Group B patients exhibited more favorable outcomes than did Group A patients (62 versus 36%, P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The surgical results for the anterior cerebral artery territory were significantly better for Group B than for Group A, with respect to outcomes of anterior cerebral artery symptoms (81 versus 40%, P = 0.015), revascularization on angiograms (79 versus 16%, P &lt; 0.001), and hemodynamic changes on single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic scans (70 versus 52%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidences of postoperative infarctions were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: EDAS with bifrontal encephalogaleo(periosteal)synangiosis is a more effective surgical modality for the treatment of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, compared with simple EDAS, because it covers both the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery territories of the brain </plain></SENT>
