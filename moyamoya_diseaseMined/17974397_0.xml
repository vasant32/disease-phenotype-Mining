<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition is <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, and there are no pathological explanations for this cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case with unilateral juvenile MMD is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 13-year-old girl with sudden episode of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0003690'>limbs weakness</z:hpo>, accompanied by transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> attack, was admitted to our hospital for further investigation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral panangiography reve-aled a high grade stenosis of the right supraclinoid ICA and a peculiar network (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo>) formed by dilated basal collateral perforating arteries and produced a cloudy image resembling "a puff of smoke" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left carotid angiogram showed a collateral circulation through the anterior communicant artery and apportioned to the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vertebrobasilar system was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An ultrasoud Doppler study demonstrated a severely decreased blood flow gradient (0.1 l/min) through the right hypoplastic ICA, while the left common and the left ICA showed remarkable increased blood flow, partly due to abondant collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Acquired, non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005602'>progressive vitiligo</z:hpo> with areas of complete pigment loss appeared on flexor wrists, extensor distal extremities, superior eyelids and especially on joints regions (elbow, knee and small joints of the hands and fret) </plain></SENT>
