<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disease associated with ACTA2 mutations has been likened to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, but appears to have distinctive features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study involved the analysis of neuroimaging of 13 patients with heterozygous missense mutations in ACTA2 disrupting Arg179 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distinctive cerebrovascular features were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of proximal internal carotid artery, occlusive disease of terminal internal carotid artery, an abnormally straight course of intracranial arteries, and absent basal '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>' collaterals </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Key differences from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were more widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e>, the combination of arterial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_474'>ectasia</z:mpath> and stenosis and, importantly, absence of the typical basal '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>' collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of previously published cases suggests some of these features are also seen in the ACTA2 mutations disrupting Arg258 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observation that transition from dilated to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/stenotic arterial calibre coincides with where the internal carotid artery changes from an elastic to muscular artery supports the hypothesis that abnormal smooth muscle cell proliferation caused by ACTA2 mutations is modulated by arterial wall components </plain></SENT>
