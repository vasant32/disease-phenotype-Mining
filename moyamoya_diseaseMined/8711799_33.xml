<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is well recognized that revascularization surgery using direct and/or indirect bypass provides effective surgical management for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, surgical treatment of the adult hemorrhagic type remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of surgery for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 35 patients with adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (patient age, over 20 years), 24 patients with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 11 patients with initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> who underwent both direct bypass surgery of the superficial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery anastomosis and indirect revascularization of encephalo-duro-arteriomyo-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 24 patients with hemorrhagic-type disease, 3 showed rebleeding: of 11 patients with the ischemic type, 2 showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 5 of 35 patients (14.3%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after revascularization surgery (mean follow-up period, 6.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography revealed that direct anastomosis is effective whereas indirect revascularization is not always effective for adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels, which are supposed to be responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, decreased in 25% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Revascularization surgery cannot always prevent rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels was induced by surgery, which may reduce the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> more effectively than conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases of adult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, direct bypass is particularly important, since the indirect revascularization is not as useful in adult cases as in pediatric cases </plain></SENT>
