<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The postoperative rCBF was measured 39 times in these 13 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rCBF in the operculum and in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes was measured with 133Xe inhalation method and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the parietal and occipital lobes, the preoperative rCBF had a negative and significant correlation with their ages, but not in the operculum or frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent to the surgical treatment, the rCBF increased significantly in the patients 5 years old or less, and then post-operative rCBF values had significant negative correlations with age in each region </plain></SENT>
