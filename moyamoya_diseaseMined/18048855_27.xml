<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objectives of the present study were to estimate an annual number of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in Japan and to describe the clinicoepidemiological features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of 2 questionnaire surveys, which were distributed to randomly selected departments of neurosurgery, internal medicine, neurology, cerebrovascular medicine, and pediatrics in hospitals throughout Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first survey inquired about the number of the patients treated in 2003, and the second requested additional detailed clinicoepidemiological information about each patient identified in the first survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2003, the total number of patients treated in Japan was estimated at 7700 (95% confidence interval, 6300 to 9300) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sex ratio (women to men) of the patients was 1.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For men, the peak of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was observed in patients aged 10 to 14 years and for women aged 20 to 24 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Annual rate of newly diagnosed cases in 2003 was 0.54 per 100,000 population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Family history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> was found in 12.1% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority (77.9%) were treated as outpatients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinicoepidemiological features of the patients in the present study were almost similar to those obtained in previous ones, the estimated prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in Japan has almost doubled during the recent decade (3900 in 1994 and 7700 in 2003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase could partly be explained by the increase in newly diagnosed cases (0.35 in 1994 and 0.54 in 2003 per 100,000 population) </plain></SENT>
