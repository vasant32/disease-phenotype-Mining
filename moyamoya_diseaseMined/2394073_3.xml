<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subsequent development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> led to the typical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> features being found on carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of dilated collateral arteries were then recognized, and the initial MRI findings considered to represent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> were reinterpreted as areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although rare, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> should be considered in the differential diagnosis in young patients presenting with symptoms and signs suggestive of multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
