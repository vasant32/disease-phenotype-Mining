<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Revascularization surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients is believed to prevent cerebral ischemic attacks by improving cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, measures preventing the occurrence of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> in patients have not yet been established in the literature due to the low rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> as well as the originally limited numbers of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, poor understanding of the clinical course of rebleeding, correct surgical management, and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present here the results of an overall survey of patients with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in a district of Miyagi Prefecture in Japan and examine their clinical course, efficacy of revascularization surgery, and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study included 28 moyamoya patients with episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> between 1976 and 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 14.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 4 males and 24 females, aged 7 to 69 years (mean 39.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography and CT scans were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was performed in 19 patients (67 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>9%), and 10 patients (35.7%) underwent revascularization surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed the clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also studied the relationship between the efficacy of surgical treatment and long-term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the 28 patients (17.9%) died of the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 2 patients died of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding occurred in 6 of the remaining 21 patients (28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The interval to rebleeding ranged from 2 to 20 years (mean 7.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of these 6 patients, 4 died of rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding was observed in 1 of 8 patients who underwent bypass surgery and in 5 of 13 patients who did not, which suggested that rebleeding was less likely to occur in patients who had undergone bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in rebleeding ratio or mortality between patients with and those without revascularization surgery (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we compiled the results of meticulous follow-up conducted over the past 10 years for patients with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Because hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is known for its high rate of mortality at the time of rebleeding and often causes rebleeding long after the initial episode (as much as 20 years later), implementation of long-term preventive measures for rebleeding is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a long-term prospective study of a large number of patients with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is required to determine whether bypass surgery prevents rebleeding of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
