<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aggressive blood pressure lowering is controversial because of the risk of ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To establish the optimal postoperative management protocol to prevent symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I]-iodoamphetamine single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography was performed 1 and 7 days after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis on 152 hemispheres from 108 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (2-69, mean 33.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 2004 and 2007 (period 1), 65 patients were maintained under normotensive conditions after 93 operations, and only patients with cerebral hyperperfusion underwent blood pressure lowering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Between 2008 and 2010 (period 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 43 patients were prospectively subjected to intensive blood pressure lowering (&lt;130 mm Hg of systolic blood pressure) immediately after 59 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then the incidence of symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion was compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure the day after surgery was significantly lower in period 2 (mean, 120.9 mm Hg) than in period 1 (133.9 mm Hg) (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion was seen in 22 patients during period 1 (23 hemispheres, 24.7%), but only in 4 patients during period 2 (6.7%, p = 0.0047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that prophylactic blood pressure lowering was significantly associated with the prevention of symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion (p = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion was relieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without developing a permanent neurological deficit due to cerebral hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prophylactic blood pressure lowering prevents symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion after STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Accurate diagnosis of cerebral hyperperfusion and blood pressure lowering, and considering the severity of hemodynamic compromise in the contralateral and/or remote areas are essential for postoperative management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
