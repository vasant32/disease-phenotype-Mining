<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 43-year-old non-Japanese patient presented with neurological symptoms, which, following carotid Doppler ultrasound and angiography, was labelled as being due to a spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repeat imaging at 3 months showed normalisation of the carotid Doppler findings which coincided with the formation of "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e>" vessels on the angiogram </plain></SENT>
