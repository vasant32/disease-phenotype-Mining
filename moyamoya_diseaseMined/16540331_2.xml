<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the presence of the radiological hallmarks of adult MMD on a "brain check-up" (BC) using MRI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BC was offered to 11,402 healthy subjects (7570 men and 3832 women) between January 1997 and November 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects was 53.2 years (SD 11.1); the mean age of men was 53.2 years (SD 10.9) and women 53.2 years (SD 11.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MMD was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight subjects (4 men and 4 women) were diagnosed as probable MMD without neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the percentage of subjects with asymptomatic MMD on BC was 0.07% for the total group, 0.05% in men and 0.10% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The female to male ratio was 3.3:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the MMD patients was 54.0 years (SD 12.0); men 54.8 years (SD 12.8) and women 53.3 years (SD 13.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Estimates of the prevalence of MMD in the Japanese population were calculated as 50.7 per 100,000 people; 28.9 in men and 94.3 in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a family history of definite MMD and seven had a family history of subarachnoid or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MRI and angiography showed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) in five patients and a unilateral ICA in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels were confirmed on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our standard BC protocol is limited for the detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels in the initial stages of MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that the radiological features of MMD are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
