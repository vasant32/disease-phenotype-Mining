<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrovascular response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), blood volume (CBV) and transit time (TT: CBV/CBF) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> using <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 23 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, including eight pediatric and 15 adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, ten patients were examined both before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pediatric patients showed a marked increase in the CBV and a prolonged TT, especially in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adult patients also showed a prolonged TT, but it was less prominent than that observed in pediatric patients, while the CBF remained at the level of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> was markedly impaired in both the pediatric and adult patients, which thus indicates a decrease in the hemodynamic reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the CBV, TT and cerebrovascular response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improved, mainly in the temporal cortex where extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery had been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the striatum, the CBV also decreased, while the TT was shortened after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A PET study was thus found to be useful for evaluating the cerebral hemodynamics in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and monitoring the effect of surgery </plain></SENT>
