<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 10-year review of the Dijon Childhood Neurology Clinic experience (1985-1995) identified 54 patients with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was established by CT-scan and angiography and by magnetic resonance imaging from 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When an hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was identified, a cerebral arteriogram and an investigation of the coagulation factors were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was identified, the following tests were performed: an ultrasound examination of the cervical arteries, a cerebral arteriogram, a lumbar puncture, an investigation of the coagulation factors and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> status, a measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17485">homocystine</z:chebi> in the plasma and the urine, an electrocardiogram, a Holter procedure and a cardiac echography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 11 full calendar years of this study, we observed 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 31 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, representing some 57% of the total, as well as 23 cases of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, representing 43% of the total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 31 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 4 had no known predisposing condition, 6 occurred in children with pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moya-moya disease</z:e>, 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 2 had a carotid dissection, 1 had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic-uremic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 14 were observed in patients with other associated conditions, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (7 cases) or slight cranial trauma (7 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On CT-scan, a basal ganglia infarction was identified in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 23 hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 9 were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, 2 to arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and 5 to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018920" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cavernomas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two cases occurred in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e>, 2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, and 2 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">throat infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case had no etiologic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical course was marked by a low mortality rate even in hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and hemidystonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This neuro-imaging survey focused on the real place of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and basal ganglia infarctions in children under 16 years of age, compared to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow-up demonstrated good or complete resolution of neurological deficits despite the frequent late hemidystonia and late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
