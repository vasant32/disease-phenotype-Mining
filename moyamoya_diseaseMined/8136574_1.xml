<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five noninvasive criteria for the diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and hemodynamic testing using ocular pneumoplethysmography, duplex carotid ultrasound, and transcranial Doppler sonography were established: (1) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ocular pneumoplethysmography demonstrating no pressure significant stenosis to the level of the ophthalmic artery; (2) abnormal Doppler spectral waveforms showing either no flow or a high-resistance flow pattern for the ipsilateral cervical internal carotid artery; (3) paradoxically low flow velocities for the ipsilateral intracranial (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), and markedly abnormal high velocities for the contralateral ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>; (4) decreased ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vasomotor reactivity; and (5) deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory ipsilateral subcortical watershed infarction evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report demonstrates that a noninvasive battery of tests may be useful in the early diagnosis and treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
