<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology, pathology, and mechanism of pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 15 human autopsies were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, in order to create an animal model of the disease, 21 Japanese rabbits were divided randomly into two groups and subjected to injections of horse serum either intravenously or locally in the area of the sympathetic ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The pathological features of the autopsies and the animal models both involved intima <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and stenosis or even occlusion of the lumen in the terminal ends of the internal carotid artery and the anterior and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disconnections or even breakages of the inner layer of the lumen were also observed, without an obvious <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hyperplasic smooth muscle cells of the medial membrane had extended inward through broken portions of the internal elastic lamina, with intima cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> resulting in lumen stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hyperplastic vascular walls were positive for IgG and IgM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> may involve allergic <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanism is that proximal portions of the circle of Willis first develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stenosis or occlusion, leading to compensatory small vessel proliferation, which perforates into the cerebral parenchyma </plain></SENT>
