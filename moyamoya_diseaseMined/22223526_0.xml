<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>July 2011 at the children's hospital Zurich by Frau <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> Dr.Khan and Prof.Meuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On this occasion I was asked to give a survey of this disease, so the following points were presented and discussed: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Who was the person who discovered this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>How has the Research Committee of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan (RCMHWJ) contributed to clarify the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology and treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>What is the current situation in foreign countries especially Euroamerican to date on these topics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>How the treatment technique developed and who did the initial revascularization procedures for the first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Update of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Established view; discovery of the disease by Tekeuchi and Shimizu in 1955 could have been called somewhat into question as they described neither abnormal vasculature nor transdural anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Kudo who described "spontaneous occlusion of the circle of Willis" more precisely, but seemed to have thought that the occlusion site of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is around the origin of the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Suzuki and Takaku who coined the name <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD) in 1969 and described 6 stages of progression on the basis of observation on 20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The RCMHWJ founded in 1977 has contributed to clarifying the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment and etiology by interdisciplinary cooperative study having some epoch making events especially; (1)by setting the guide lines -diagnostic criteria of the disease at the end of 1970, (2)applying MRI and MRA at the beginning of 1990 for the diagnosis instead of angiography used until then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>(3)By finding and focusing, therefore, on the cases of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic presentation around the middle of 2000, which have almost doubled or tripled in incidence and/or prevalence and also changed the age distribution with the higher peak for adult cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Achievements of research for the etiology and pathophysiology by genetics and molecular biology have enabled the discovery of basic FGF and other cytokines-angiogenetic factors and recently the genetic linkage site 17q25.3 in relation to the familiar incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies verified by molecular biological methods have indicated that the vascular occluding process with intimal proliferation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation does not occur only at the carotid fork originally researched intensively, but also at more distal parts of the cerebral arteries which could be verified with the help of molecular biology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Occurrence but less incidence of the disease in the Euroamerican countries had already been noticed at the beginning of 1970 and its reason has been researched and discussed intensively in relation also to the etiology of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The first extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery for a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of the disease might have been carried out by Prof.Ya≈üargil and Prof.Reichman independently around the end of 1972 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The indirect revascularization methods such as EMS, EDAS are now combined with or without EC-IC bypass to augment cerebral blood flow (CBF) of the hemodynamically compromised territory not only of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, but also of the ACA and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The big disadvantage of indirect revascularization might be the large size of the craniotomy necessitated for the purpose, which would decrease CBF of the brain surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The author is doing multiple bypass procedures (bilateral EC-IC bypass plus STA-ACA bypass) in one session in accordance with the findings of CBF examination with small craniotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Prevention of rebleeding by revascularization is still under study but its results should be scrutinized on the basis of various etiologies and sites of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Besides some increase of epidemiological knowledge of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic cases and of etiological molecular biological and genetic linkage studies, clinically, the mechanism of contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in patients in whom one side is operated upon or/and hyperperfusion after revascularization and its prevention seems to be one of main topics in recent journals </plain></SENT>
