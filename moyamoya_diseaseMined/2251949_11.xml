<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were evaluated clinically, angiographically, and by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (PET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative external carotid angiograms showed a good collateral circulation through EDAS in 72 percent of the treated sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of the sides examined by PET showed improvement in cerebral blood circulation, particularly at the surgically-treated cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively the symptoms disappeared in those with good new collateral formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e>, and/or involuntary movement disappeared in 31 percent and partially so in 44 percent 6 months after EDAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in the lower limb and/or involuntary movement persisted in some children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This surgical approach seems applicable particularly for children with the ischaemic type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, however, the procedure also has drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Development of collateral circulation was insufficient in some cases, and the territories of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) were often not covered, even in those with a good new collateral formation in the middle cerebral arterial (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) area </plain></SENT>
