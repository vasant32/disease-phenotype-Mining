<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the epidemiology of unilateral MMD (typical angiographic evidence of MMD unilaterally with equivocal contralateral findings), and quasi-MMD (MMD present with inherited or acquired disorders) is poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, a nationwide epidemiological survey was conducted to estimate the total numbers of patients, the annual incidence rates and prevalences of MMD, unilateral MMD and quasi-MMD in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The neurosurgery, neurology and pediatrics departments that were listed in Japanese resident training programs were recruited to participate in this survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were directly mailed to 2998 departments in February 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1183 departments replied to the questionnaire (39.5% response rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was estimated that there were 6670.9 MMD patients, 840.5 unilateral MMD patients and 430.4 quasi-MMD patients in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence rates of MMD, unilateral MMD and quasi-MMD are 1.13, 0.23 and 0.11/100,000, respectively, and the prevalences are 5.22, 0.66 and 0.34/100,000, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients were mainly treated by neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An estimated total of 929.1 surgical interventions are performed in Japan annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This nationwide study reports the current epidemiologic status of MMD, unilateral MMD and quasi-MMD in Japan </plain></SENT>
