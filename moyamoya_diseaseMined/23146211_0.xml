<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature detailing the natural course of MMD/S in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate epidemiological information, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates, and risk factors for these events in patients with MMD/S, we reviewed our own institutional cohort of 42 North American adults with MMD/S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 38.8 (standard deviation [SD] 12.7) with a 5:1 female-to-male predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>About 74% of patients had an ischemic presentation while only 17% presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean Suzuki grade was higher in patients presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (3.7 compared to 2.9, p=0.03) but similar in those who presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as compared to those who did not (3.00 compared to 3.05, p=0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates were 13.3% and 1.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were female sex (p=0.031) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation within 3years (hazard ratio [HR]=4.08, p=0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Smoking was another risk factor, but it did not meet statistical significance (HR=1.56, p=0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that these results favor intervention for MMD/S to mitigate the high annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This particularly applies to females and/or those presenting with a recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results also serve as a baseline for comparison of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rates after intervention </plain></SENT>
