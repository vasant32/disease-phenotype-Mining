<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the clinical efficacy of diffusion-weighted and perfusion echo-planar magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were examined prospectively with diffusion-weighted and perfusion echo-planar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The change in the effective transverse relaxation rate (delta R2*) peak value, delta R2* peak time, and delta R2* integral were calculated to assess regional cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were compared with angiographic images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 34 posterior cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCAs</z:chebi>) of the 17 patients, 14 PCAs (41%) in 11 patients showed stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The delta R2* peak value ratio in the cerebral hemispheres decreased significantly, and the delta R2* peak time ratio increased significantly, with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation was apparent between perfusion and extent of the stenotic or occlusive lesions of the internal carotid artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> was significantly increased in patients with stenotic or occlusive <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarctions, a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient was significantly correlated with a decrease in the delta R2* peak value, an increase in the delta R2* peak time, and a decrease in the delta R2* integral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regional cerebral perfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is decreased and delayed with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> stenosis, with greater decrease and delay with <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted and perfusion imaging are useful for evaluating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
