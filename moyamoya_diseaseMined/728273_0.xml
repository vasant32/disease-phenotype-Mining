<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the first report of this disease by Shimizu and the author in 1955, many cases have been reported not only in Japan but in many countries outside Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been already clarified either clinically or pathologically, that, in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya Disease</z:e>, the most important finding is the basal arterial occlusive change of unknown etiology and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>Moyamoya Phenomenon</z:hpo> is only nonspecific neuroradiological change as the extraordinary dilated collaterals via the striate arteries, perforators etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the real cause of the arterial obstruction is still obscure in the so-called "true <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya Disease</z:e>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be necessary in order to establish a new clinical entity related to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya Disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, under existing situations, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya Disease</z:e> must be strictly differentiated from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>Moyamoya Phenomenon</z:hpo> which can be frequently observed among cases with basal occlusion of known and unknown origin </plain></SENT>
