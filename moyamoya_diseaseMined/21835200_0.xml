<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To facilitate an EMS in patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases other than MMD, the transfer of pro-angiogenic genes via transplantation of retrovirally transduced myoblasts into the temporal muscle may represent an innovative approach to augment collateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, we tested whether retrovirally transfected myoblasts can spontaneously fuse with the non-ischemic and uninjured muscle tissue and if a reporter gene can be stably expressed within the temporal muscle of the EMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary mouse myoblasts expressing a reporter gene were implanted into the temporal muscle prior to an EMS being performed on C57/BL6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three different implantation modalities were evaluated: (a) intramuscular injection, (b) application of a cell pellet and (c) a combination of both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myoblast implantation resulted in spontaneous fusion with the host muscle fibers and stable reporter gene expression at both the muscle/brain interface and within the non-ischemic and uninjured temporal muscle in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of fused hybrid myofibers was 59±28 after injection, 37±30 after pellet application and 60±23 after a combination of both techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the implantation modality, an abundant extracellular expression of the reporter gene was evident at the muscle/brain interface; in the case of myoblast delivery by injection, expression was also observed around the needle tract marking the implantation site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This method could be used in the future to deliver angiogenic growth factors to the muscle/brain interface in order to improve revascularization after an EMS </plain></SENT>
