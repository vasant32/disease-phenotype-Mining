<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiology and clinical features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a prospective and retrospective cohort of Saudi children and ascertain the causes, pathogenesis, and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Retrospective Study Group (RSG) included children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who were evaluated at the Division of Pediatric Neurology, or admitted to King Khalid University Hospital, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period July 1992 to February 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Prospective Study Group (PSG) included those seen between February 2001 and March 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the combined study periods of 10 years and 7 months, 117 children (61 males and 56 females, aged one month-12 years) were evaluated; the majority (89%) of these were Saudis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calculated annual hospital frequency rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 27.1/100,000 of the pediatric (1 month-12 years) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the 104 Saudi children was 27.1 months (SD = 39.3 months) and median was 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic strokes</z:hpo> accounted for the majority of cases (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Large-vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (LVI, 51.9%) were more common than small-vessel lacunar lesions (SVLL, 19.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five patients (4.8%) had combined LVI and SVLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> was less common (18.2%), whereas sinovenous <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was diagnosed in 6 (5.8%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A major risk factor was identified in 94 of 104 (89.4%) Saudi children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Significantly more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathies</z:hpo> were identified in the PSG compared to the RSG (p=0.001), reflecting a better yield following introduction of more comprehensive hematologic and coagulation laboratory tests during the prospective study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hematologic disorders</z:e> were the most common risk factor (46.2%), presumed perinatal ischemic cerebral injury was a risk factor in 23 children (22.1%) and infectious and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disorders</z:e> of the circulatory system in 18 (17.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Congenital and genetic cerebrovascular anomalies were the underlying cause in 7 patients (6.7%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> in 6 (5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six patients (5.8%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, which was associated with another disease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> (3.8%) included 3 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SNE">Leigh syndrome</z:e> and a 29-month-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> encephalomyopathy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was a risk factor in 3 children (2.9%) including 2 who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004906'>hypernatremic dehydration</z:hpo>; and post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> was causative in 3 cases (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Several patients had multiple risk factors, whereas no risk factor could be identified in 11 (10.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Due to the high prevalence and importance of multiple risk factors, a comprehensive investigation, including hematologic, neuroimaging and metabolic studies should be considered in every child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
