<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were hyperventilated, and changes in cortical surface blood flow were detected by a heat clearance method with plate type thermocouple probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>End-tidal <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> was monitored during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> to avoid excessive reduction of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were three types of blood flow responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>: simple reduction, prolonged reduction, and increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Simple reduction was noted in four cases and was related to constriction of basal and ethmoidal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prolonged reduction was noted in three cases and was related to excessive constriction of basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increase was noted in four cases and was related to increase in blood flow from cranial vault <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the basal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> vessels are constricted by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
