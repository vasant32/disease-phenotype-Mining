<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a series of patients with optic pathway <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> treated at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, five children were encountered who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> after radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of the medical records was undertaken in order to assess the relationship between optic pathway <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> type 1 (NF1), radiation therapy, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients with optic pathway <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> were operated on at The Hospital for Sick Children between 1971 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> did not occur in any of the 19 patients not receiving radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 28 patients who received radiotherapy, five developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (two of 23 without NF1 and three of five with NF1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant relationship between radiotherapy and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> when the analysis was stratified according to the presence of NF1 (Mantel-Haensel chi-squared test 15.23, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The high incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (three of five cases, or 60%) in patients with NF1 who have undergone radiotherapy suggests a synergistic relationship that should be considered when formulating a treatment plan for NF1 patients with optic pathway <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
