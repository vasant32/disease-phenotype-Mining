<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A genetic background was under speculation, because of the high incidence of familial occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sibling cases usually exhibit a similar clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, RNF213 was identified as the first MMD susceptibility gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The c.14576G&gt;A variant of RNF213 significantly increases the MMD risk, with an odds ratio of 190.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is a strong association between clinical phenotype and the dosage of this variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present study described sibling MMD cases having homozygous and heterozygous c.14576G&gt;A variant in RNF213, as well as different clinical course and disease severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The homozygote of c.14576G&gt;A variant showed an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> age and rapid disease progress, which resulted in significant neurological deficits with severe and wide distribution of vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the heterozygote of the variant showed a relatively <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> age and mild clinical course without irreversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> with limited distribution of vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of sibling MMD cases with different doses of the RNF213 variant, showing its genetic impact on clinical phenotype even in members with similar genetic background </plain></SENT>
