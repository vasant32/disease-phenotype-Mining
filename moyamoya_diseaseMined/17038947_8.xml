<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In unilaterally symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in children, it remains controversial whether bypass surgery should be performed on the asymptomatic side along with on the symptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to verify the validity of our strategy of only performing bypass surgery on the symptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 91 pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent bypass surgery in our department between 1980 and 2004, 20 with unilateral ischemic symptoms who were followed for more than 60 months were analyzed in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, we only performed bypass surgery on the symptomatic side for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among these 20 patients, five developed frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in the initially asymptomatic side and underwent a second bypass surgery on that side (Group A), eight developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and were followed up without surgery (Group B), and seven did not experience any ischemic symptoms on the asymptomatic side (Group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In total, 18 patients progressed well without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> after their last surgery, although some showed deterioration of angiographic stenosis and a transient decrease in the regional cerebral blood flow or cerebral perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient in Group A had an <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> 5 years after the second operation, and one in Group B had a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on the initially asymptomatic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In unilaterally symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, bypass surgery for the asymptomatic side can be delayed until the development of ischemic symptoms, such as frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
