<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In Asian populations, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> has a well-defined phenotype including a bimodal age of presentation with children typically presenting with ischemic phenomena and adults presenting with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have provided evidence that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> in the United States may exhibit a different phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess overall rates of admission, demographics, procedures, and outcomes of patients admitted or diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> disorder in US hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A comprehensive assessment of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (2002-2008) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, comorbidities, procedures, and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 2280 admissions for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> disorder with a predicted national estimate of 11 163 admissions (0.57/100 000 persons/y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over time, there was a significant increase in diagnosis and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Females (72%) were affected more than males (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Demographics included white (49%), black (24%), Hispanic (11%), Asian (11%), and other (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean age at presentation was 31.6 ± 18.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Children were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ischemic phenomena (16.4%) than <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (3.3%), as were adults (18.8% vs 11.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Status at discharge was largely routine (74.8%) vs short-term hospital (3%), home health care (7%), transfer to another hospital (12%), or in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients admitted to US hospitals diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> disorder were more commonly female and white, and both adults and children were more likely to be diagnosed with ischemic vs hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over time, there was an increase in diagnosis, associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and treatment with extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
