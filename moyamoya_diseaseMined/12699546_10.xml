<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the natural course of hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and the characteristics of rebleeding remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To study the natural course of the disease in conservatively treated patients, we analyzed long-term follow-up reports on 36 patients (12 male and 24 female) treated without bypass surgery at our hospitals before 1994 (mean follow-up, 12.7 +/- 7.1 yr; range, 2.9-27.0 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of our 36 patients, 22 (61.1%) experienced rebleeding; there were 29 rebleeding episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The outcomes in patients with rebleeding were worse than in patients who did not rebleed (P &lt; 0.05); in most cases, unsatisfactory results were attributable to rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analysis of rebleeding-free survival showed that age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (&gt;36 yr) was a statistically significant risk factor; sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, type of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp>, and outcome after the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episode were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the intervals between the first and subsequent episodes varied, both the rebleeding rate and the number of rebleeding episodes were highest in patients 46 to 55 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rebleeding is the most important factor in unsatisfactory outcomes of patients with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding seems to be age-related; rebleeding occurs at an increased rate when patients reach the age range of 46 to 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> must be followed up throughout their lives, even if their neurological status is excellent </plain></SENT>
