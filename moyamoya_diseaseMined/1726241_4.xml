<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Omentum was homogenized and fractionated to investigate the presence of an endothelial cell growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of extracts was measured by the growth activity of bovine aortic endothelial cell incubated for 6 days with various omentum extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fraction had no growth promoting activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the water soluble extracts were active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activity could be increased by <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi> precipitation (60-80% saturation) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">Heparin</z:chebi> affinity chromatography revealed poor <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The activity was stable at pH 3.5 and pH 9.5, but inactivated by heating at 70 degrees C for 10 minutes or 100 degrees C for 2 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These properties clearly distinguish the omentum-derived growth factor (OmDGF) from the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> binding growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>OmDGF is probably distinct from other vascular endothelial cell growth factors </plain></SENT>
