<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two pediatric cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> starting with unilateral involvement of the internal carotid artery are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases angiographic findings at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> showed unilateral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, they were filed as a "probable" case according to the diagnostic criteria of the Japanese Cooperative Research Committee </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The carotid angiograms on the other side showed totally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestation, EEG findings, angiographic findings, and PET findings in these cases were the same as those of definitive bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The only exception was the unilaterality of the findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One to three years later the occlusive lesions became bilateral, and this met the criteria as a "definite" case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We consider that some of the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> actually start with unilateral lesion and develop into bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiograms in "probable" cases should be carefully followed up to establish the disease entity of this lesion </plain></SENT>
