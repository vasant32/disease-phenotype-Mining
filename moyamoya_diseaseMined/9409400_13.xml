<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study encompassed 98 cases; 26 were newly collected from eight US institutions and 72 were previously reported in the US literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 67 years with age peaks in the first, third and fourth decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MMD was seen in various ethnic groups and females were more commonly involved (71%) than males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A specific etiology could not be determined in most cases but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and use of oral contraceptives were occasional associations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On angiography and/or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion was seen bilaterally in 95 cases (97%) and unilaterally in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> or MRA, internal carotid steno-occlusive lesions were well demonstrated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> collateral vessels (MMVs) were visualized in only 65% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMVs in the basal ganglia and thalami were best demonstrated on T1 weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal lesions were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and were often bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With advances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> techniques and increasing awareness of diagnostic guidelines, MMD will be diagnosed more frequently than before in the US </plain></SENT>
