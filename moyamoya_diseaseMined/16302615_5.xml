<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical, imaging, and perioperative data from 170 procedures in 90 children who underwent indirect revascularization surgery were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To clarify the risk factors, cases with identified ischemic complications and those without such events were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For this study, a postoperative ischemic complication was defined as a newly developed infarction within 2 weeks after surgery, which was confirmed by follow-up imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The higher ischemic risks from surgical treatment should be considered for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who are younger than 3 years of age and have a preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is also recommended that the revascularization surgery be delayed for at least 6 weeks after the development of the previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
