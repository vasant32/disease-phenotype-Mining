<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in white matter integrity by using DTI in NAWM of patients with MMD and to evaluate the correlation between diffusion and perfusion characteristics through an interhemispheric comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 20 primary MMD patients with asymmetric disease stage and 20 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FA(CS) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(CS) values of bilateral centrum semiovale were measured by using region of interest analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean FA(CS) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(CS) were compared between patient and control groups by unpaired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interhemispheric differences in FA(CS) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(CS) were assessed and compared between the H-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>(delayed) and the H-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>(shorter) by using paired t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AIs also were assessed to verify interhemispheric differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient group showed a significantly lower mean FA(CS) and a higher mean <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(CS) value than the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the patient group, the H-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>(delayed) had a significantly lower FA(CS) and higher <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>(CS) value than the H-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>(shorter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both AI(FA) and AI(<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were significantly higher in the patient compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DTI can describe subtle changes in white matter integrity in NAWM of patients with primary MMD that are not detected by conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, diffusion characteristics are well correlated with perfusion characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We believe that DTI is a useful ancillary tool to evaluate patients with MMD </plain></SENT>
