<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the correlation between ivy sign and cerebral perfusion status has not been fully evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To characterize ivy sign on FLAIR images in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> and compare this finding with hemodynamic alterations on perfusion single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) obtained before and after bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with angiographically confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> who underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of ivy sign on FLAIR images was classified as 'negative', 'minimal' and 'positive' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the relationship between ivy sign and findings of SPECT, including cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Minimal or positive ivy sign was seen in 13 (81%) of 16 patients, and 21 (66%) of 32 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CVR in the areas with positive or minimal ivy sign was lower than that in the areas with negative ivy sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, ivy sign disappeared or decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 hemispheres demonstrating ivy sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SPECT demonstrated apparent hemodynamic improvement in areas demonstrating disappearance or decrease of ivy sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ivy sign on FLAIR image is seen in areas with decreased cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sign is useful for non-invasive assessment of cerebral hemodynamic status before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
