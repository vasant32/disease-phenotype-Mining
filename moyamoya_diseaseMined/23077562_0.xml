<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a case-control study to investigate whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF -2578, -1154, -634, and 936) and kinase insert domain containing receptor (KDR -604, 1192, and 1719) polymorphisms are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Korean patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (n = 107, mean age, 20.9±15.9 years; 66.4% female) and 243 healthy control subjects (mean age, 23.0±16.1 years; 56.8% female) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into pediatric and adult groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 64 surgical patients, we evaluated collateral vessel formation after 2 years and divided patients into good (collateral grade A) or poor (collateral grade B and C) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequencies and distributions of four VEGF (-2578, -1154, -634, and 936) and KDR (-604, 1192, and 1719) polymorphisms were assessed from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in VEGF -2578, -1154, -634, and 936 or KDR -604, 1192, and 1719 polymorphisms between the control group and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found the -634CC genotype occurred less frequently in the pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> group (p = 0.040) whereas the KDR -604C/1192A/1719T haplotype increased the risk of pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> (p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with the CC genotype of VEGF -634 had better collateral vessel formation after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the VEGF -634G allele is associated with pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and poor collateral vessel formation </plain></SENT>
