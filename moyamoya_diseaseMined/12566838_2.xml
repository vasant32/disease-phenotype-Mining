<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI was performed preoperatively on 13 cases of childhood MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the perfusion MRI findings, patients were classified into four groups: those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) (group 1, n = 2); those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBV and delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (group 2, n = 1); those with increased rCBV and delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (group 3, n = 5), and those with decreased rCBV and delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (group 4, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume as determined using the rCBV map was compared with that on MRI and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of groups 1, 2 and 3 were a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> finding on MRI, early angiographic stages, decreased reserve on SPECT and favorable operative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group 3, angiography revealed abundant collateral channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group 4, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases had infarction on MRI and abnormal perfusion on SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic stages tended to have progressed, and operative outcome was less favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI documented hemodynamic asymmetries in the five cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI is suggested to have a sensitivity intermediate between rest and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> SPECTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that perfusion MRI may be a valuable tool for characterizing and monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perfusion MRI provides additional functional information not available from conventional MRI and has a potential role comparable to SPECT in the evaluation of MMD </plain></SENT>
