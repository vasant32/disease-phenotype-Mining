<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report is intended to clarify the effects of surgical revascularization on peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which represent one of the causes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Findings for three female patients who experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed that <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> resulted from the rupture of peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from dilated collateral vessels such as the lenticulostriate artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patients successfully underwent superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis combined with encephaloduromyoarteriosynangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated obliteration of the peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, together with the disappearance or decrease in caliber of the parent collateral arteries, after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients experienced rebleeding during the follow-up period (up to 52 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results strongly suggest that surgical revascularization potentially improves cerebral circulation and decreases hemodynamic stress on collateral vessels, obliterating peripheral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
