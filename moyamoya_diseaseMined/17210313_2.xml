<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old boy presented with repeated transient motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the left arm and leg for 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On his admission, physical examination and neuropsychological testing showed no exact neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging showed a giant <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in the right basal ganglia and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed occlusion of left ICA and bilateral <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> with well-developed basal collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A giant <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was also noticed in angiography, which was filled by basal collateral vessels from both left anterior circulation and posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> combined with a Spetzler-Martin grade V <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was managed nonoperatively and discharged with close follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We present a rare case of giant <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>-associated with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and giant <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> makes planning any aggressive treatments difficult </plain></SENT>
