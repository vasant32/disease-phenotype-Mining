<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment focused on improving picture naming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An alternating treatments design was used with a multiple baseline design across stimuli to examine effects of both approaches in two participants with varying degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003113" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anomia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The features approaches were modified in that three, rather than six, features were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differential effects were found across participants; this appeared to be a function of each participant's strengths or preferences over the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modest generalization effects were obtained for one participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Naming error analyses revealed patterns suggestive of increased lexical access for both participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings provide evidence that using a modified features-based protocol can improve naming when incorporating both semantic and phonological feature cues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Naming error patterns can provide additional evidence of improved naming during treatment </plain></SENT>
