<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 16 cases whose CT scan were available at the time of the first <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> at the basal ganglia was noted in 43.8%, primary ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 37.5%, thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with ventricular rupture in 12.5% and subcortical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 6.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequencies shown above were well correlated to previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In MRI performed 1 year or more after primary ventricular <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> site was demonstrated at the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle, in proton weighted and T2 weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI can detect the site of old <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> points and its chronological change if the study is repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up period of 5.4 years, 27.8% of the cases had rebleeding one or more times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result, good outcome was noted in 72.2% after the 1st <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and in 55.6% after re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 5.6% of patients after the 1st <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and in 22.2% after further rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding worsened the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, prevention of rebleeding is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From a therapeutic viewpoint, although a direct relation between rebleeding and untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> could not be established, blood pressure control is critical at both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reconstructive vascular surgery is a recommendable method for properly selected patients </plain></SENT>
