<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular reconstruction procedures run the risk of changing the balance between oxygen supply and consumption during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the value of visual light spectroscopy for detecting changes in cerebral blood oxygenation (CBO) during superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We developed a VLS monitoring system which permits continuous monitoring of CBO changes during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the VLS, we evaluated the CBO changes in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory on the lesion side in 18 patients who underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Temporary occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M4 portion) did not change the CBO in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the patient with dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, it caused decreases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and cortical oxygen saturation (CoSo(2)) associated with an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, although these CBO changes were normalized by STA blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients, STA blood flow increased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and CoSo(2) and decreased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi>, indicating that cortical blood flow (CoBF) was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CoSo(2) before anastomosis was significantly low in the patients who showed an increase of CoSo(2) by STA blood flow (63.0% +/- 2.5%) as compared with those who did not (72.0 +/- 6.1%, P = .024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Temporary occlusion of a cortical artery during bypass surgery did not affect the CBO in patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, but caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the patient who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>STA blood flow increased the CoBF during surgery more frequently in patients who showed a low perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The VLS monitoring system is considered useful for evaluating bypass function and facilitates safe and accurate bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
