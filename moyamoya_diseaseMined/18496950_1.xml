<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We introduce less invasive technique for superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis, and also described an innovative technique to preoperatively identify the recipient artery using three dimensional CT angiography (3D CTA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a period of 28 months between January 2004 and April 2006, 39 EC-IC bypass were performed for hemodynamic compromised patients (including 9 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>) using less invasive technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Operative technique is as follows: 1) A parietal or frontal branch of STA and cortical arteries could be identified on the original images of 3D CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most suitable segment of both the artery provided as donor and recipient arteries for EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The distance between the afore-mentioned segment of donor artery (STA) and the superior border of the helix were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>2) A 5 cm linear skin incision on the STA, the center of which was the point measured on preoperative 3D CTA, was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The temporal muscle was divided in the same fashion, and a 3 cm small craniotomy was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The recipient artery could be identified on the center of the craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>End-to-side anastomosis was performed in the usual way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operation times were 115-172 min (mean 154 min) and intraoperative blood loss was 20-60 ml (mean 38 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> bypasses were patent on the post-operative 3D CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This technique for EC-IC bypass was less invasive and cosmetically excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>3D CTA provides useful information for planning of the less invasive EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
