<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The optimal treatment regimen for hemorrhagic type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> has yet to be clearly established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it remains unclear as to whether or not bypass surgery can help prevent future intracranial hemorrhaging in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Japan, several treatment options, such as conservative, medical, and surgical intervention, have been employed for the treatment of hemorrhagic type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, 282 hemispheres with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were analyzed based on a 1995 nationwide survey by the Research Committee on Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya Disease</z:e>) of the Ministry of Health and Welfare Japan to clarify the current status of treatment for hemorrhagic type <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires were distributed to the departments of neurology, neurosurgery, and pediatrics <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over Japan asking about both treatment and rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, 12.5% of the affected hemispheres were treated conservatively while 32.3% were medically treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ventricular drainage and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> removal was performed in 15.8%, and revascularization surgery in 38.3% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hemorrhagic sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the revascularization procedures used, 45.7% of the hemispheres underwent single indirect bypass surgery, such as EDAS while 22.2% of them received a direct (superficial temporal artery--middle cerebral artery: STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combination of direct and indirect bypass surgery or a combination of different kinds of indirect procedures comprised 32.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine out of 282 hemorrhagic hemispheres demonstrated rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 15 hemispheres with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> even though nine of them had undergone bypass surgery prior to hemorrhaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nearly 18% of the patients with hemorrhagic type disease experienced rebleeding regardless of the treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, there remains no clearly superior treatment plan for hemorrhagic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> to prevent rebleeding at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the selection of patients, treatment modalities, and the timing of the surgery might <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> play an important role in controlling rebleeding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The final outcome of the patients are therefore mainly considered to correlate with the initial severity of the clinical features </plain></SENT>
