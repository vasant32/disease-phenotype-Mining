<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study presents our clinical experience of endovascular embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with MMD or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> were treated by endovascular embolization between January 2001 and January 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> group (n=10) and a pseudoaneurysm group (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different endovascular therapeutic strategies were employed for each type of case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 cases, 11 received successful endovascular embolization and had an uneventful postoperative course during one to two years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, endovascular embolization failed in the other two cases, of whom one died from rebleeding after the five-month follow-up, while the other was conservatively treated and experienced no rebleeding during the two-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A favorable prognosis may be secured through careful selection of endovascular treatment regimens for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with MMD or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25255">MMS</z:chebi> according to the site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
