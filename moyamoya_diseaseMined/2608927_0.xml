<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were diagnosed by cerebral angiogram, and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis technique and EMS were done to reconstruct the rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low perfusion areas were detected around the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and that of anterior and middle cerebral arteries by <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT and 133Xe-rCBF image met by X-ray CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After surgery, 4 out of 6 cases showed the improvement of rCBF by <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>-SPECT and 133Xe-rCBF image, as for clinical symptoms, there were reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 3 cases, and no rehemorrhage in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
