<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Signal intensity of the middle cerebellar peduncles was measured using a region of interest in 40 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and in 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> on axial diffusion-weighted imaging with the motion-probing gradient perpendicular to the image </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional six patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> but with large supratentorial sequelae of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or infarction were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in signal intensity between both middle cerebellar peduncles in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, but lower signal intensity was consistently observed in the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle in 12 moyamoya patients with large supratentorial lesions in the middle cerebral artery distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding was observed in the six non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients, too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Decreased signal intensity of the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle might be a remote effect caused by a large supratentorial lesion in a crossed cerebellar fashion </plain></SENT>
