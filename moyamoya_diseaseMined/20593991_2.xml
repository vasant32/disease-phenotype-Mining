<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate clinical characteristics in the early postoperative period, the authors prospectively analyzed findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, and SPECT before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors focused in particular on how postoperative neurological deterioration occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 2005 and June 2009, 22 patients younger than 18 years of age with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were treated at Miyagi Children's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age (+/- SD) was 8.58 +/- 4.55 years (range 2-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass and indirect bypass of encephalosynangiosis between the brain surface and the temporal muscle, galea, and dura mater were performed in 35 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were performed before surgery, at 7 days postoperatively, and 3-6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A (123)I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi> iodoamphetamine SPECT scan was also obtained pre- and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the postoperative period, neurological deterioration was observed after 15 operations (10 cases of motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, 1 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, and 4 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e>) in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptoms had resolved by the time of discharge, except in 2 patients who suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients exhibited disappearance (94.3%) or reduction (5.7%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perioperative studies revealed 2 different types of radiological findings, focal uptake decrease on SPECT indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to dynamic change in cerebral hemodynamics caused by bypass flow, the so-called watershed shift, and perioperative edematous lesions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging due to cerebral hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequent occurrence of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> was significantly associated with watershed shift, whereas preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging findings and preoperative SPECT findings were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age at operation was the only factor significantly associated with postoperative hyperperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In young patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> exhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0003678'>rapid progression</z:hpo>, resulting in poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The risk of postoperative neurological deterioration in very young <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> patients with frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> should be noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The findings in this study showed that direct bypass is not completely safe in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> because it causes dynamic change in postoperative cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
