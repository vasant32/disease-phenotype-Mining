<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed conventional carotid ultrasonography and transoral carotid ultrasonography on 19 ICAs in 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> group) and 28 ICAs in 14 control subjects (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether the diameter was greatly reduced at the proximal portion of the ICA above the bulbus, like a champagne bottle neck, to be less than half that of the common carotid artery and whether the diameter of the ICA was smaller than that of the external carotid artery (diameter reversal) on conventional carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then measured the internal diameter of the extracranial distal ICA by transoral carotid ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared the incidence of a "bottle neck" appearance, diameter reversal, and the ICA diameter between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The bottle neck and diameter reversal were shown in 14 (74%) and 16 (84%) of the 19 ICAs in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> group, respectively (chi2 test, P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, neither of them was shown in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diameter of the distal ICA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> group was significantly smaller than that in the control group (mean+/-SD, 2.4+/-0.60 versus 4.1+/-0.52 mm; unpaired t test, P&lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rapid internal diameter reduction at the proximal portion of the ICA, characterized by a bottle neck appearance or diameter reversal, is an important morphologic feature of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
