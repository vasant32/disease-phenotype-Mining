<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the factors predictive of contralateral progression in children and adolescents with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> (MMD), the authors retrospectively analyzed clinicoradiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 394 consecutive patients with MMD aged 0 to 17 years were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral MMD was defined based on the typical angiographic findings of MMD in 1 hemisphere and no abnormality in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 394 patients with MMD, 45 (11.4%) had unilateral MMD and the prevalence increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Untreated contralateral hemispheres were followed by serial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography was performed if contralateral progression, defined as any noticeable change in the contralateral internal carotid artery and/or middle cerebral artery, was suggested by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of the 45 (17.8%) had angiographically documented progression over a mean follow-up of 53.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean time to contralateral progression was 27 months (range, 21 to 37 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An age at diagnosis of &lt;9 years was found to be the only independent predictor of contralateral progression (P=0.025), which persisted despite adjustment for sex and ipsilateral Suzuki stage (hazard ratio, 8.26; 95% CI, 1.01 to 67.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other factors, including abnormalities in the contralateral anterior cerebral artery, were not found to be predictive of progression to bilateral MMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of contralateral progression in our cohort of children and adolescents with unilateral MMD appears to be lower than those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, contralateral progression tended to occur in children aged &lt;9 years within 3 years of initial diagnosis (32%) </plain></SENT>
