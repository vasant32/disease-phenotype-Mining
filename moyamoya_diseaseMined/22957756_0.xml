<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Yet the long-term outcome in surgically treated patients still needs to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 30 years have passed since the authors' department started intensively treating pediatric patients with MMD using indirect anastomosis techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors surveyed the current status of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Activities of daily living (ADLs) were surveyed and present clinical status was assessed based on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular events subsequent to surgical treatment were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Since 1979, 208 patients younger than 19 years of age with MMD were surgically treated and followed up for &gt; 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were available on 172 patients (83%), who had been followed up for a mean of 14.3 years (range 3-32 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activity of daily living outcomes were as follows: 138 patients (80.2%) had mRS scores of 0-2, 29 (16.9%) a score of 3, 1 (0.6%) a score of 4, 1 (0.6%) a score of 5, and 3 (1.7%) a score of 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular events occurred 8 or more years after surgery in 6 patients (3.4%), that is, 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> and 3 infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 10, 20, and 30 years after surgical intervention was 0.8%, 6.3%, and 10.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This long-term survey demonstrated that most surgically treated pediatric patients with MMD maintain good ADL outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, a significant number of new cerebrovascular events occurred more than 10 years after the initial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Additional follow-up will help to identify which events may occur during the adult years of patients treated as children </plain></SENT>
