<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There are few data in the EEG literature describing the time course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>-(HV) induced changes in blood gases, despite this being a routine activating procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied changes in blood gases and EEG in nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult subjects before, during, and after HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean PCO2 fell 18 mm Hg from the baseline during HV and recovered in 7 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> rose 7 mmHg during HV and fell to 25 mm Hg below baseline 5 min after HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PCO2 recovery period is longer than is usually assumed in clinical EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> fall to a nadir at 5 min after the end of HV suggests that close attention should be paid to this period, as is confirmed by the re-buildup seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite uniform changes in blood gases, the EEG median power frequency change showed marked variability; on average, it dropped by 1 Hz during HV and returned to baseline within 2 min of resumption of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> respiration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EEG root-mean-square power showed a 200% increase during HV and also had returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 2 min </plain></SENT>
