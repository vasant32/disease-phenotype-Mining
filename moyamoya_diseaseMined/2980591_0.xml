<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the past 3 years, the Xe-CT has been performed in 22 children with ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, including 17 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, rCBF maps revealed low flow in the bilateral frontal and temporal cortices, and high flow in the thalamus and putamen on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other diseases showed low perfused areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Xe-CT can be easily performed even in infants and children and it gives valuable information that may be of clinical use </plain></SENT>
