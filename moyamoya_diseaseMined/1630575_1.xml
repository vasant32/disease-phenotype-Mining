<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She bore a baby son by natural delivery after several hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After labor, her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was continuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain CT scan demonstrated intracerebral and <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After conservative treatment for two weeks, her only neurological deficiency was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated that her left internal carotid artery had partial stenosis at the C2 portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her right internal carotid artery had stenosis at the C2 portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her right middle cerebral artery was occluded at the M1 portion, and abnormal vascular networks had developed in the ganglionic region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was also found in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed her as being a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo>, unilateral, atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our case is a very rare example of unilateral atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
