<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and clinical manifestations of intracranial arterial occlusive lesions (IAOLs), and their correlation with thyroid function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We enrolled 7 patients who had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> (GD) with IAOLs screened and evidenced by transcranial Doppler, then further confirmed with digital substract angiography in 2 patients and magnetic resonance angiography in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 7 patients, 1 was male and 6 were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age was 32.0 +/- 5.5 (range from 11 to 49) years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of them had symptoms of GD but one was asymptomatic with abnormality of T3, T4, and thyroid stimulating hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesions of intracranial arteries were symmetrical bilaterally in the internal carotid artery system in 6 patients, as well as asymmetrical in 1 patient Terminal internal carotid artery (TICA) were involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were involved in 3, anterior cerebral artery in 2, and basilar artery in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Net-like collateral vessels and mimic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were observed in the vicinity of the occlusive arteries in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and/or infarction while IAOLs were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients had obvious <z:hpo ids='HP_0004305'>involuntary movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI revealed infarctions located in the cortex, basal ganglion, or hemiovular center in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The neurological symptoms were improved concomitant with relief of the thyroid function in 2 patients, while IAOLs were aggravated with deterioration of the thyroid function in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IAOLs in patients with GD mainly involve intracranial arteries, especially the TICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, which is similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The neurological symptoms and severity of involved arteries may relieve while the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> is gradually under control </plain></SENT>
