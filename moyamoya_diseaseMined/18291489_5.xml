<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> is a rare complication after surgical revascularization for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, and its mechanism is totally undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, experiencing crescendo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> on her left hand, underwent STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis on the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging 1 day after surgery demonstrated asymptomatic vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> without ischemic change at the subcortex under the site of the anastomosis that expanded the next day, and STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was apparently patent with the strong high signal by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-[(123)I]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="110" ids="2679">amphetamine</z:chebi> single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT showed marked increase in the CBF on the hemisphere operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four days after surgery, the patient complained of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and experienced severe monoparesis in her left hand due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> at the corresponding lesion to the prior vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>Edema</z:hpo> around <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was prolonged for as long as a month; while intensive blood pressure control and the use of adrenocorticosteroid gradually relieved her symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient completely recovered from her symptoms 2 months later, and she was discharged without neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> completely disappeared postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early increase in CBF associated with vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation at the site of the anastomosis could be the warning sign for subsequent hemorrhagic complication, and intensive blood pressure control is warranted in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it would be necessary to elucidate the biochemical mechanism of the deleterious cascade during reperfusion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> to avoid this rare complication </plain></SENT>
