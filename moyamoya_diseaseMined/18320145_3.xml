<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> (IVH), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the ventricular system without a discernable parenchymal component, is a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better define the features of primary IVH and the yield of diagnostic angiography in this condition, we retrospectively analyzed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of primary IVH evaluated at a tertiary referral hospital over a 6-year period and performed a systematic review of the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the retrospective case series, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with primary IVH admitted to the neurovascular service at a single tertiary referral center over a 6-year period were identified by screening a departmental database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For the systematic review of the literature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case series of patients with primary IVH diagnosed by computed tomography were identified in the Medline database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the systematic review, the majority of patients with spontaneous primary IVH presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (69%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> (53%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> (66%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most primary IVH patients had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (62%), and about one-third required ventricular drainage (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic cerebral angiography was positive for a <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> source in 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two most common causes identified by angiography were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (58% of positive angiograms) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (36% of positive angiograms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Approximately one-third of patients with primary IVH do not survive hospital discharge (39%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient age and amount of IVH independently predicted in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Primary IVH is a rare form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>, with varying short-term outcomes that depend on patient age and the extent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The yield of diagnostic cerebral angiography in the setting of primary IVH is very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The two most common causes of primary IVH identified on angiography are <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Routine catheter angiography in the setting of primary IVH is warranted </plain></SENT>
