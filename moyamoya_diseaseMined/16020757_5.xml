<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya syndrome</z:e> is a rare cerebrovascular disease characterized by progressive occlusion of intracerebral arteries with a typical "puff of smoke" angiographic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> in a patient with ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is an 18-year-old female who presented at age 13 with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> was found, a diagnosis of ET was made, and treatment with anagrelide was started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts, she experienced recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe stenosis of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery (LICA) and abnormal collateral vessels were found, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya syndrome</z:e> was diagnosed on the basis of the characteristic angiographic appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An intracranial stent was placed in the LICA, and since then, she has had an uneventful outcome after a 46-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011834'>moyamoya phenomenon</z:hpo> has not been reported in ET, and the relationship between these 2 disorders remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Besides, this is the first intracranial carotid stent implanted successfully in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
