<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies were evaluated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and control subjects, and their associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were estimated using multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 114 pediatric patients and 114 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients displayed higher prevalence of increased thyroid function and elevated thyroid autoantibodies in comparison with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These remained significant after multivariate adjustment; the ORs (95% CI) for increased thyroid function and evaluated thyroid autoantibodies were evaluated as 12.47 (1.55 to 100.51) and 4.33 (1.29 to 14.59), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased thyroid function and elevated thyroid autoantibodies are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> and therefore monitoring of thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> is suggested, which might help to guide subsequent clinical management </plain></SENT>
