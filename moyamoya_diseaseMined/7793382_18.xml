<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the value of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test with stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT (Xe CT) for making therapeutic decisions in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the Xe CT-measured <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> response with various measures obtained by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed both a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic scan and a Xe CT study in 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebral ischemic diseases within a 1-week interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase of cerebral blood flow after injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was expressed as delta AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen metabolism, oxygen extraction fraction, and cerebral blood volume were measured with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi>-labeled gases by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In low-cerebral blood flow regions, decreased delta AT was accompanied by a significant elevation of oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume, compared with oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume in regions of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> delta AT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plotting of regional data indicated that delta was significantly dependent on oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area of decreased vascular reserve determined by the Xe CT image corresponded to the area of "misery perfusion" determined by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test with Xe CT may offer an alternative to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography in detecting lesions with elevated oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood volume (misery perfusion) that result from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
