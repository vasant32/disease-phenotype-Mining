<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We detected various histologic lesions in the perforating arteries of 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vessels showing rupture ranged from 50 to 530 microns in diameter; they were dilated, some had fibrin deposits in the wall, fragmented elastic laminae and attenuated media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-ruptured perforating arteries (diameter 200 to 550 microns) revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333101" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">microaneurysm</z:e> formation, focal fibrin deposits and marked attenuation of the wall thickness with diminution of the elastic lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes seem to predispose to rupture of perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenotic changes such as fibrous intimal thickening, collapse of the lumen and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were detected in 14 out of 22 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphometric analysis of perforating arteries indicated that arteries showing extreme degrees of stenosis or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> were more frequent in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> than in the control cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dilative arteries were more frequent in the young patients and stenotic vessels were, in contrast, less frequent in the young patients </plain></SENT>
