<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the literature, visual disturbances from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> have been described, but very few reports of intraocular pathological conditions have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000533'>chorioretinal atrophy</z:hpo>; an association between these two diseases has not previously been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings of a clinical ophthalmological evaluation and angiographic series are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the fundic examination, evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000533'>chorioretinal atrophy</z:hpo> was found in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Choroidal vascular insufficiency was revealed by intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography and occlusion of the ICAs proximal to the origin of the posterior communicating arteries by selective carotid and vertebral arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The vertebrobasilar system provided anastomotic connections via the posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first case report of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000533'>chorioretinal atrophy</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the vasoocclusive effects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> may predispose the patient to atrophic changes in the peripheral retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The development of an anastomotic network precludes the progression of this fundic anomaly </plain></SENT>
