<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>INDICATIONS: Defect coverage with thin, pliable, and well-vascularized tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A bilayered TPFF provides a gliding surface in tendon reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further options include TPFF harvest with overlying skin or subjacent bone for composite tissue reconstruction or the application as a sensate local fascial flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum defect dimensions: 17 × 14 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONTRAINDICATIONS: Absolute: prior injury to the flap or flap pedicle, temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya syndrome</z:e>, defects with volume deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> along the planned incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Pedicle location is outlined using Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injection of the incision line with diluted <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Skin incision with subsequent visualization of the temporoparietal fascia and supplying vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Skin flaps are raised carefully paying special attention to the hair follicles (CAVE: postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Primary closure of the donor site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Defect coverage with pedicled or free TPFF with subsequent full or split-thickness skin grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dressing: Bolster or V.A.C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Immobilization/elevation in the setting of extremity reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Removal of bolster dressing or V.A.C. on postoperative day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Dangling protocol instituted on postoperative day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Removal of sutures/staples at the donor site on postoperative day 5-7 and at the recipient site on postoperative day 12-14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The TPFF was utilized for soft tissue reconstruction in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A pedicled TPFF was used in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mean time to healing was 16.3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 13.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Successful reconstructive results with satisfactory functional and aesthetic appearance were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Complications were encountered in 3 patients and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo> at the donor site and iatrogenic injury to the frontal branch of the facial nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Vascular compromise was observed in the early postoperative period in a third patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, operative revision resulted in successful flap salvage </plain></SENT>
