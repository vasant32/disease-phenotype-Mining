<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 24 total patients (age range: 2-15 years; mean age: 8.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis (EDAS) on 16 sides, 5 patients underwent encephalo-duro-arterio-myo-synangiosis (EDAMS) on 8 sides and 7 patients underwent combined superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis with EDAMS (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-EDAMS) on 12 sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The postoperative results were evaluated between 4 months and 5 years following surgery in terms of the angiographic revascularization and the clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: EDAMS, regardless of the combined STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, was significantly effective for achieving a good extent of the postoperative angiographic revascularization as compared with simple EDAS (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>-EDAMS tended to be better with respective to the relief of preoperative ischemic symptoms as compared with simple EDAS, although there was no significant statistical difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that EDAMS with or without the combination of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was very useful for the formation of collateral circulation in comparison with simple EDAS for treating the pediatric patients with MMD, although these findings were not well correlated with the clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
