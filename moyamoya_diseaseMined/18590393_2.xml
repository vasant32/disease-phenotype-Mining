<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A preoperative skull block may reduce hemodynamic fluctuations and hypo- or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> due to emergence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirium</z:e> or oversedation and provide adequate pain relief, thereby reducing postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pediatric patients (age 3-13 years) undergoing EDAMS surgery for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> were randomly divided into a nerve block (NB) group (18 cases) or control group (21 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treatment group patients received a preoperative NB (0.25% 5-8 ml <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> mixed with 20-40 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>) targeting the supraorbital, supratrochlear, auriculotemporal, and posterior auricular nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group did not receive NB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> was induced in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the NB group, stable hemodynamic parameters were obtained with a lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> concentration than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011206" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">delirious</z:e> awakening, the odds ratio in the control group was 4.9 compared with the NB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pain and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> requirement were higher in the control patients than in the NB-treated patients during the postanesthesia care unit stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the arterial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> tension in the postanesthesia care unit did not differ between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio in the control group for the rate of morbidity (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0553690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rind|RIND">reversible ischemic neurological deficits</z:e>) during the first 24 hours following the operation was 3.2 compared with the NB group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of skull block during EDAMS surgery provided easy hemodynamic control, calm awakening, and better pain relief and may be related to the reduced postoperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
