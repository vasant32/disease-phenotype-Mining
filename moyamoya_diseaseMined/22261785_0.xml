<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen surgically treated cerebral hemispheres from 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selective ASL examinations were performed during the early postoperative period (mean, 5.5 days) on 4 hemispheres and late postoperative period (mean, 332.7 days) on 15 hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The labeling slab was positioned at the bypassed external carotid artery and 5 slices in each of the 10 sequential phases were acquired using a 3-T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two of 4 early postoperative ASL examinations and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> late postoperative ASL examinations demonstrated blood flow through the bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 2 early postoperative ASL examinations showed absence of blood flow; however, blood flow improved on follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiphase selective ASL technique can provide information about the dynamics of postoperative blood flow through the bypass in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
